<DESC>This is a sole source requirement to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 6900 Main Street, P.O. Box 9729, Stratford CT 06615-9129 (cage: 78286) to provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS) services. <br /><br />The USAF maintains and operates a fleet of HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters that are distributed across seven Major Commands (MAJCOMs). These helicopters are used for a variety of missions, including combat search and rescue, infiltration, ex-filtration and re-supply of special operations forces in day, night or marginal weather conditions. The USAF HH-60G is a variant of the Army UH-60A/L model with a number of modifications, including in-flight refueling capability and upgrade modifications to the navigation and communications systems. Due to the aging fleet and aircraft losses in combat, the USAF formed an Operational Loss Replacement (OLR) program to replace HH-60G aircraft. The OLR program acquisition strategy is to acquire Army UH-60M baseline helicopters and modify these aircraft to meet user requirements. The newly assigned Mission Design Series for these modified aircraft will be HH-60U. The first base (unit) to receive aircraft will require initial logistics and engineering support until such time it is considered self-supportive. Further, due to the introduction of substantial improvements and changes to the basic airframe and flight deck avionics suite, this may present unique logistical and technical support situations that may be beyond the level of Air Force expertise at this location.<br /><br />The ICS contract will primarily consist of logistics and engineering liaison support (also referred to as &lsquo;reach-back' support) for a geographically separated location in CONUS. The number of modified aircraft to be supported will be three (3). The ICS contract will consist of one basic year plus two one-year options. Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) is the only known source in possession of the complete engineering design, maintenance, and repair data for the airframes and dynamic components. SAC is the only possessor of this comprehensive knowledge for the HH-60U helicopter. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Approximate issue date of the solicitation is 4 April 2011. For additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, pertaining to this acquisition, all potential offerors should contact the buyer, Rick Saltsman at richard.saltsman@wpafb.af.mil or 937-255-8574, by 1 April 2011.

Project Description:  The Evan Hewes Highway is an existing highway originally constructed to replace the Old Plank Road through the sand dunes between Yuma, AZ and El Centro, CA and continuing through to San Diego, CA. The original asphalt road was constructed in the mid 1920's by the state of California and decommissioned in the mid 1960's when I-8 was built. During its period of service it was replaced once and received numerous overlays and repairs. This section of road has been used primarily for access to the sand dunes recreation area in low volume traffic conditions. Most recently, Evan Hewes Highway has been used for construction traffic for the building of the new Brock Storage Reservoir and associated structures. 
The principal components of work to be performed include the following:
1.	Removing existing pavement on Evan Hewes Highway to depth indicated on drawings.2.	A total rebuild of the section of Evan Hewes Highway that was removed for the Brock Reservoir project.3.	Resurfacing of Evan Hewes Highway with an ARHM on traveled way.4.	Crack repair on shoulders of Evan Hewes Highway to include slurry seal where applicable.5.	Striping of the new roadway.

This requirement will be solicited and awarded using the method outlined in FAR Part 14 - Sealed Bidding.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price construction type.  
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin August 1, 2011 with an anticipated completion date of November 29, 2011.

<SUBJECT>Elephant Butte Powerplant Excitation Systems Replacement
<SOLNBR>R11PS40012

<CONTACT>Kent R. Munro Contract Specialist 8015039572     kmunro@usbr.gov;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for replacing three excitation systems at its Elephant Butte Power Plant Facility, which is located approximately 5 miles east of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico in Sierra County.  It is anticipated that a full-and-open competition in accordance with FAR Part 15 will be conducted due to recent market research suggesting insufficient small businesses qualified to successfully perform this requirement.  The solicitation is projected to be released sometime in April 2011, but is subject to change.
The designated NAICS code for this requirement is 335312 - Exciter Assemblies, Motor, and Generator Manufacturing.  The principal components of the work involve the following tasks:  Furnish and install new fully static excitation equipment for the three units in the powerplant including fused disconnect switches, power potential transformers, circuit breakers, SCR bridges, digital voltage regulators and associated limiters, instrumentation, protection, and control components.  Electrically disconnect existing rotating exciters, which are to remain in place.  Modify generator terminal tap locations, unit control boards, and unit protection cabinets.  Remove three former voltage regulator cabinets and three existing excitation cabinets, field breakers, and associated equipment (3 total of each).  Furnish and install conduit for power circuits.  Furnish and install conductors for power circuits.  Furnish and install control and metering wiring.  Furnish spare parts.  Furnish drawings and data.  Train Government personnel in operation and maintenance of new excitation system.  Factory and field test the excitation systems and associated equipment.
It should be noted that, due to funding uncertainties, the work will likely be split between the manufacturing and delivery of three excitation systems via a supply schedule, and the installation of the same systems via an option construction schedule under the same contract.  As such, the contract will likely be awarded only for the manufacturing and delivery of these systems.  If, during contract performance, additional funding becomes available for the installation of the work, then the option for installation will likely be exercised.  The estimated price range for the magnitude of construction, including both the supply and installation of excitation systems, is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. 
Interested potential offerors are encouraged to add themselves to the "Interested Vendors" list for this presolicitation notice.  All questions concerning this presolicitation notice should be directed, via e-mail only, to Kent Munro at kmunro@usbr.gov.  Phone calls will not be returned.  This is a presolicitation only, and is not a request for bids or offers.  This requirement is subject to change at any time and may be cancelled without further notice.

<a href="mailto:debbie.r.matthews@msfc.nasa.gov">Debbie R. Matthews</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a wide range of human capital support services tovarious NASA/MSFC programs and projects.  Currently, OHC supports Center management,major space programs as well as smaller programs and projects, Center staff offices, andCenter directorates which conduct engineering and scientific research, space hardware andsoftware, development, and operations in space exploration.  The OHC organization mustunderstand the direction of the Agency and the Center, anticipate Center needs andrequirements, and be responsive, prompt, and effective in providing its day-to-dayproducts and services.	OHC customers and partners are managers, Center employees, NASAHeadquarters and other NASA Centers, other Government agencies, academia, and industry. This action will allow NASA/MSFC to continue receiving human capital support servicesfrom Will Technology, without disruption and at the appropriate levels, throughout theCenter and through the upcoming Center reorganization.	 These services are required tomeet the Agencys needs.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Will Technology.  Competition isimpractical, at this time, for the following reasons:1.	The Center will soon be undergoing a major reorganization due to the change inAgency and Center programs which will demand a high commitment of the OHC personnel aswell as the OHCs support contractor, Will Technology.	Will Technology is certified asan 8a, Woman-Owned, Small-Disadvantaged business.  Due to budgetary constraints as wellas the on-going changes in the Centers programs and mission, there is a greatuncertainty about the magnitude of the impact of these changes on the OHC requirements. The OHC heavily utilizes Will Technology to analyze workforce data and develop workforceplanning recommendations, support the Center workforce (employees, supervisors, andmanagement officials) in addressing transition impacts, and assist in partnering withorganizations to identify and procure training to support retraining of the workforce andcompetency development.  Will Technology has performed exceptionally well in supportingthe OHC not only with the reorganization activities thus far, but with StrategicWorkforce Planning, Academic Affairs, Training and Incentives, and Employee andOperations Services as required by the contract.  It is anticipated that there will beadditional impacts as the Center realigns its programs, mission, and budget.  With thelevel of uncertainty in the Centers future mission and roles it would be extremelydifficult to establish the requirements for a contract re-competition during thiscritical time and, therefore, would not be in the best interest of the Government.  Dueto the expertise already available and the time spent by Will Technology in assisting theOHC in the Centers reorganization, as well as providing exceptional support for theoverall contract requirements, it is recommended that the Center extend the OHC supportservices contract with Will Technology for an additional 12 months.  This extension willallow the OHC to utilize the existing expertise to implement and complete the Centerreorganization as well as provide continued day to day support during this critical time. 2.	Approval of this action will allow for continuation and stability of theseservices through the upcoming Center reorganization due to the change in Agency andCenter programs which will demand highly committed OHC personnel.  This extension willprovide time for the Center to determine the course of action for implementing this newreorganization, which in turn will allow appropriate planning for a successfulrecompetition of the OHC contract.  MSFC intends to initiate a competitive procurementfor its follow-on requirements for human capital services in March 2012 that will resultin a new contract award in March 2013.	If this extension is not approved, a SourceEvaluation Board must be stood up no later than April 1, 2011.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon March 31, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Northrop Grumman, 44 Castilian Drive, Goleta, California 93117.
  The IDIQ will cover a five year period with a minimum of one and maximum of five to procure Multi-Domain Electronic Warfare Test and Evaluation System (METES).  The non-commerciall solicitation will be issued using other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman IAW FAR 6.302 and statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of the technical data for the system resulting in a lack of drawings and specifications, in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  
The proposed IDIQ is for a METES system or systems for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman, under authority 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Northrop Grumman, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Governments requirements.
The POC is Rhea Earle, Code CXMSVS, at telephone 812-854-8744, or email: rhea.earle@navy.mil.  NAICS Code 334511; FSC Class 58.

These MK24 Ear/Mic assemblies will be utilized in existing systems.  These assemblies have been through operational and technical evaluation.  Once a system is certified, using alternate equipment would prove costly to the government and the mission.  Any variance in the equipment used in a certified system would jeopardize the certification of the system and ultimately the mission.  Acquisition of the MK24 Ear/Mic assemblies from Undersea Systems International provides commonality between systems and reduces integration cost.
  Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase these MK24 Ear/Mic assemblies from Undersea Systems International.  Responsible sources may submit a response for consideration to the agency point of contact at: tim.e.reed1@navy.mil.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  These units will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity  Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 289,600 hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site mid-April 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately 30 days. Then the solicitation will be posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 60 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov. Site Visit attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. A site visit is expected to be scheduled approximately three weeks after the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in both locations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to the Bonnie Allen at allenbj@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.

<CONTACT>Surlean Darby, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-9257, Email darbys@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving white papers and full proposals for Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Applied Research Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of multi-Service EOD operations. <br /><br />ONR has a need to develop and demonstrate emerging technologies for dismounted missions to detect/locate, access, diagnose/identify, and render safe/neutralize explosive hazards, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) to support the DoD EOD mission. <br /><br />The EOD mission is to render safe ordnance, including conventional and unconventional, improvised, chemical, biological, and nuclear IEDs and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). It includes land and underwater location, identification, render-safe, and recovery (or disposal) of foreign and domestic ordnance. EOD conducts demolition of hazardous munitions, pyrotechnics, and retrograde explosives using detonation and burning techniques. The EOD mission is unique from the role of other forces, such as combat engineers that support movement of US and allied forces.
<p>An IED is a device placed in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It can include military stores, but normally is devised from non-military components.</p>
<p>White papers and full proposals for exploratory development are sought in the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Explosive Hazardous Device Detection and Location<br />This area focuses on hand-held technologies that can detect and/or locate the presence of an explosive hazard containing energetic materials. This may include buried, obscured, and/or items out in the open. The explosive hazard may contain military-grade and/or commercial/homemade energetic material.</p>
<p>2) Explosive Hazardous Device Render Safe/ Neutralization <br />This area focuses on new information/capabilities that can be manually or robotically employed and used to neutralize IEDs or render safe conventional munitions, or substantially enhance existing EOD tools and equipment that currently perform the tasks.</p>
<p>3) Explosive Hazardous Device Munition Diagnose and Identification <br />This area focuses on the identification of ordnance and IEDs or IED components, and the materials used in the manufacture of them, including toxic industrial chemicals (TIC), toxic industrial materials (TIM), Biological materials, or Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA). Potential targets can include thick cased munitions, such as artillery shells. Emphasis will be on manually or robotically employed capabilities.</p>
<p>4) Explosive Hazardous Device Access<br />This area focuses on technologies to aid in the approach and/or access IEDs or UXO to gain greater knowledge regarding their physical composition or configuration; particularly through the use of unmanned EOD robotic systems.</p>
<p>Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 24 May 2010. As defined therein the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university. The research shall not be considered fundamental in those rare and exceptional circumstances where the applied research effort presents a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense, and where agreement on restrictions have been recorded in the contract or grant.</p>
<p>White Papers are required prior to submitting a Full Proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for technical and software maintenance services to the Insurance Service Remittance Processing System (RPS).  The TAC intends to award a sole source, one-year, firm-fixed-price contract with two (2), one-year options to BancTec, Inc. 2701 E. Grauwyler Road, Irving, Texas 75061 pursuant to authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The proposed solicitation number for this effort is VA118-11-RP-0136.  

RPS is a critical application that supports the processing of Insurance benefits.  The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Insurance Service RPS in Philadelphia, PA requires technical support and maintenance services for the system's hardware, software and database.  The system consists of two (2) separate hardware BancTec X350 configurations, one (1) for daily processing and one (1) backup.  Each system contains a BancTec designed and built transport, three (3) high-end servers, and a minimum of six (6) PC driven peripheral devices used by the VA employees to resolve problem transactions, bills or payment instruments rejected by the high-speed process.  In addition, the system also has a high-speed printer and a security interface with the Philadelphia Information Technology Center (ITC).  This system was designed by BancTec to meet all Federal, VA and VBA requirements for passing data between the BancTec equipment, the Insurance Local Area Network (LAN) and the ITC mainframes.  Without the technical and software maintenance support services, insurance processing will cease due to the inability to access the data, preventing benefit payments to Veterans and dependents.  

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511.  The estimated date of award for this action is April 1, 2011.

This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposals.  Questions regarding this action may be directed to Peter Lewandowski, Contract Specialist at peter.lewandowski@va.gov or David Nostrant, Contracting Officer at david.nostrant@va.gov.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time. All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offers to perform this type of work. The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 541620 Environmental Consulting Services. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541620 is $20 million. 
The proposed requirement is for technical modeling assistance using the Colorado River Simulation System (CRSS) and Spanish translation of CRSS concepts and results in support of binational technical modeling discussions with Mexico.
The binational modeling work group, comprised of technical representatives from the U.S. and Mexico, was started in 2009 to develop and analyze joint strategies for Colorado River management in light of ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels. This effort was successful in 2010, providing the hydrologic impact analysis behind Minute 318 signed in December. In 2011, the binational modeling work group will continue to provide technical analysis in support of a more comprehensive longer-term agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. Prior to technical discussions resume in April, Reclamation is considering acquiring expertise for the U.S. contingent that is well versed in CRSS and proficient in the Spanish language. This would minimize the risk of important technical details being overlooked or misinterpreted during these discussions.
Reclamation is seeking at least five years of modeling experience using CRSS, fluency in the Spanish language, and experience interpreting and communicating technical CRSS concepts and results in Spanish. Responsibilities would include meeting attendance, CRSS model and rule set development, examination and analysis of CRSS results, and presentation of technical CRSS modeling concepts and results in Spanish and English.
The project period of performance (5 months) is anticipated to begin April 1, 2011 with an anticipated completion date of August 31, 2011, with the possibility of extension depending on the requirements of the binational process. 
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Ms. Cris Forbes at the address listed below. Capability statements are to be submitted no later than March 21, 2011.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity. Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number. Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length. This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate. 
All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Ms. Cris Forbes, Contract Specialist, P. O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail mforbes@usbr.gov. 
When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/

<SUBJECT>System to Provide NERC CIP Compliant Access to Substation Data
<SOLNBR>DE-RFI-WN04125
<RESPDATE>041511
<CONTACT>Eric M. Samuels, Contract Specialist, Phone 9163534537, Fax 9169851933, Email samuels@wapa.gov
<DESC>Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Sierra Nevada Region (SNR) is interested in obtaining information from potential suppliers regarding systems that are designed to facilitate its compliance with current and future NERC Cyber Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards, while securely maintaining access to substation data for its maintenance engineers. The following sections list some of the areas of consideration that the Region is considering for possible implementation.
<p>Limited, Secure, Logical Access with CIP Compliance Capability. Provide information regarding system design that allows a single point of access at the substation that is designed to be secure and meet CIP Compliance. Describe the extent and method by which the system can be expanded to serve many serial and network devices in the substation while maintaining a single point of access. Describe what CIP requirements are met with your implementation, and how your implementation meets those requirements.</p>
<p>Features designed to meet CIP Compliance by taking advantage of existing security infrastructure. Western desires to take advantage of existing workflows and processes for its other systems to meet CIPS compliance for its Substation data. What features does your product provide that allows for centralized management of access that is synchronized to the existing corporate infrastructure (eg. LDAP, Active Directory)? What features facilitate the management associated with authorizing and tracking access to all resources in the system? Describe features of your product that have been implemented to meet the CIP stringent requirements for password change management at the IED level. Please describe features that provide for access control and rights for different levels of users at the IED level. Where and how are these features implemented in your system?</p>
<p>Management of IED Configurations. Please provide detailed information regarding features implemented to manage IED configurations. Of particular interest are features that support IED configuration version control, change tracking, detection of actual configuration changes (whether authorized or not), and reporting on configuration changes. Please describe comparison and reporting tools that facilitate the ability for a user to quickly determine and report on detailed changes that have taken place in the configuration of particular devices. Please provide a list of devices or file formats for which you support configuration management with the aforementioned features.</p>
<p>Non-operational Data (eg. Fault Data) - Automatic Machine-to-Machine Data Collection. Western SNR is interested in implementations that minimize remote transparent access to substation devices for the purpose of obtaining fault data. What features do your product support that provide for automatic data collection and machine-to-machine transfer of fault data from the substation to a secure control center location for later access by maintenance engineers? Please include details regarding:<br />1. What formats of fault data you directly support? Of particular interest, discuss your support of specific GE relays, Areva relays, and Schweitzer devices. <br />2. Please describe the mechanisms that are used to initiate and implement transfer of the data, where the data is stored along the way, and how the user may access it at its destination location.<br />3. Please describe the industry standard formats that you support such as COMTRADE. <br />4. How is the conversion from proprietary formats to standard formats accomplished? Is the conversion automatic?</p>
<p>Built in VPN Support. Describe built in VPN support that you provide between your system's components. Describe how your system could be used to support CIP electronic security perimeters.</p>
<p>Remote Transparent Access. While Western SNR has an interest in limiting the need for engineers to access remote devices, it also recognizes that it may not be able to completely avoid the need for Remote Transparent Access. Remote Transparent Access requires the implementation of some type of tunneling system through which data passes between the user on one end and the IED device on the other. Please answer the following questions regarding the tunneling system:<br />1. What mechanisms do you use to insure that the tunneling system is secure?<br />2. For Remote Transparent Access, what parts of your system do you use to control access and to document activity for CIPS compliance?<br />3. Tunnels should be completely transparent. Is there any restriction on characters for any of the tunnels that would prevent that tunnel from providing complete transparency?<br /><br />Alarm, Status, and Analog Data Support. Describe the support you provide for returning relay alarm data to a secure location for access by engineers. Similarly, describe how your system makes this data available to other systems such as SCADA systems using standard protocols such as DNP. What proprietary protocols do you support for communication with IEDs for this type of data. Of particular interest are GE, Areva, and Schweitzer relays.</p>
<p>Availability of Log Data. Failure of a system containing log data may mean that the log data is not available for CIP compliance auditors. What features in your system make it possible to avoid the loss of log data in the event of failure or compromise of system components?</p>
<p>Disaster Recovery. While disaster recovery is largely based upon the processes and procedures provide by the organization that owns the equipment, it is possible that certain features or system architecture in installed equipment may be able to facilitate disaster recovery. What features or architectural solutions does your system support to facilitate disaster recovery?<br /><br />Background:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for analysis and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION. The Food and Drug Administration,&nbsp;Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,&nbsp;is seeking business sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and 8(a) certified companies. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from small business manufacturing companies that can provide an instrument to simultaneously measure mitochondrial oxygen consumption and cytoplasic glycolysis in live cells to compare mitochondrial function with oxidative damage to proteins without lifting the cell or require trypsinization. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research program involves the study of protein biochemistry and the role of oxidative stress. Mitochondrial respiration is a major source of free radicals rather beneficial or detrimental to the quality and function of proteins. CDER regulates several protein products whose function is critcally impacted by free radicals.</p>
<p>The instrument system shall meet the technical requirements described herein.</p>
<p>The instrument system must allow measurements of oxygen consumption in adherent cells. Lifting cells disrupts cell structure and ionic gradients, and hence metabolism; and lifting cells is not possible in the case of the differentiated (branched) myotubes.</p>
<p>&bull; Measures oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of living cells simultaneously<br />&bull; Uses 96 or 24-well, tissue culture microplates<br />&bull; Kinetic measurements are made in real-time<br />&bull; Completely non-invasive measurement requires no addition of dyes, labels or reporters.<br />&bull; All measurement reagents are imbedded in sterile, disposable, cartridges<br />&bull; Cells / plate are not affected by XF measurement and may be used for another assay<br />&bull; OCR and ECAR rate are calculated in 2-5 minutes using data acquired every 14 seconds <br />&bull; Typically requires only 30,000 to 80,000 cells per well<br />&bull; No cleaning required. All parts that contact cells, media or drugs are disposable.<br />&bull; Measures adherent cells without requiring trypsinization <br />&bull; Suspended cells may be measured using an adapter for cell and tissue attachment medium. <br />&bull; Up to two test compounds (drugs or substrates) may be added automatically to each well. Measurements may be performed before and after each compound is added.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Potential contractors must indicate business size, proof of any set-aside certification and company's DUNS number and provide a contact name, the mailing address, phone number and email address of point of contact. Capability statement must provide enough information to determine if the company can meet the requirement. At a minimum provide the following:<br />Specifically address technical specs identified above to show the proposed instrument meets the requirements. Other descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement. Provide two contact names, email and phone for users of the proposed system that may be contacted by the government.</p>
<p>Interested Contractors must respond with capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail or email to the point of contact listed below on or before March 24, 2011 by 13:00 hours (Central Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OA/OAGS, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-320, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502. Reference 1085656. <br /><br />For information regarding this market survey, please contact Nick Sartain at (870) 543-7370, FAX (870) 543-7990 or email nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov.</p>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)Financial Services Center (FSC) Help Desk
INTRODUCTION
This is a Market Research--Sources Sought synopsis to assist in determining an acquisition strategy.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) - Herndon on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Financial Services Center (VA-FSC) has an anticipated acquisition for identifying solutions for a consolidated help desk.
PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST AND INFORMATION SOUGHT
From this Market Research--Sources Sought synopsis, the Government is seeking responses from contractors to assist the Government in identifying industry capability to provide technology that supports a Three Tier Leveled Consolidated Help Desk for various workloads and customer needs.
The Government's intent is to obtain responses to the items listed below to assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy.  Interested contractors shall provide the following in their response:
1. Name of company, company address, point of contact name, telephone number, and email address.
2. Business size and identify the NAICS code for this requirement.
3. Are the types of technology solutions available in the commercial marketplace and therefore, can the requirement be competed as a Commercial Item Acquisition?
4. Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these type of technology solutions.
5. Recommend and give rationale for the contract type that would best suit this requirement.
6. Identify existing or potential pricing structure/methodologies in support of this type of requirement.
The proposed solution needs to be compatible to the VA-FSC existing infrastructure which is Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, and Windows NT compatible.  The FSC uses an NEC SV8500 PBX system that has an automated call distribution (ACD) system software solution.
BACKGROUND
The FSC currently has ten separate Help Desks with various levels of technological support (including phone, hardware, and software).  The ten Help Desk areas include:
1. Payroll/PAID2. Permanent Change of Station (PCS)3. Financial Accounting Service (FAS)4. Information Technology (IT)5. Financial Operations Service (FOS) Customer Support6. Financial Operations Service (FOS) Vendorizing	7. Financial Operations Service (FOS) Payment Resolution Team.8. Financial Operations Service (FOS) Travel9. Medical Claims10. Management Support Division (MSD)
It has been determined that it would be more efficient to have a consolidated Help Desk which will utilize the same phone system (NEC 8500 PBX System) and software.  The implementation of this initiative should result in improved quality of service to all VA administrations.  The idea is based on the evidence that consolidation and efficiency opportunities increase dramatically with standardization across the VA. Our standardization should include not only mergers of technology, but also strategies toward common organizational structures, procedural approaches, and business models to achieve a common culture with a consistent methodology toward problem resolution.
OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of this RFI is to identify options that can provide direction to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Financial Services Center (VA-FSC) as it explores solutions for its consolidated help desk needs.  The option may include Customer Relationship Management (CRM) as well.  To educate the FSC Consolidated Help Desk Committee on installation-wide Help Desk solutions to:
Provide a single point of contact for Customers.Provide an installation-wide ticketing system with routing and updating capabilities.Provide a knowledge database for scripts and documented resolutions.Improve service levels due to better call resolution rates.Improve productivity due to wait times and defined talk- time thresholds.Cut costs. Typically based on an assessment of cost per call received.
The Help Desk receives, troubleshoots, and responds to end-user problems or requests, logs and tracks the problems or requests, and determines the best manner to address the problems or requests.  One of the top priorities of the FSC Help Desk is to ensure a consistent response to problem resolution, service requests, status reporting, and notification of changes related to the information technology environment of the FSC.
SCOPE
The Help Desk is expected to provide basic problem resolution according to the complexity of the problem, and their experience with the specific problem - the more calls the FSC Help Desk can resolve without escalating to FSC Internal Tier 2 personnel, the better.  Calls/inquiries come from a variety of sources regarding a variety of issues; i.e., employees, vendors, veterans, health care providers.  Employee calls may be system, travel, or pay related.  Vendor calls may be payment related, or assistance on being established in our systems.  Veteran and health care provider calls may be payment related or how to file claims.
Completing FSC Help Desk ticket information as completely and as accurately as possible to capture basic level 1 information and the problem or request.  Customized FSC Helpdesk panels may be developed for specific types of problems to capture additional information that may be useful in solving the problem.
Managing the ongoing operation, administration, support, and stability of the FSC Helpdesk and Web Center applications are the backbone of this support model and mission critical to the FSC Help Desk and internal FSC Service Providers.
Providing management reporting capabilities from the FSC Helpdesk system to assist FSC Service Providers in gathering and analyzing the information they need to effectively manage FSC Helpdesk tickets assigned to their groups.

Tier One of the FSC Consolidated Help Desk will be a combination of functional and IT support. The FSC intends to adopt the ITIL framework for its Help Desk as much as practical.  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) should be part of the solution.
Working Definition of Help Desk Tier One ServicesBasic level of support where service programs are logged into the FSC Help Desk, triaged, troubleshot, and elementary problems are resolved. Examples of this include but are not limited to:
Answer incoming calls and log the problem ticket or change management request into the tracking system.For functional Help Desk questions/issues, provide assistance through the use of prepared scripts and/or Standard Operating Procedures as documented in knowledge base on issues such as vendor inquiries, payment inquiries, and system navigation inquiries. For IT Help Desk questions/issues, perform basic troubleshooting for simple hardware/software problems and provide assistance with commercial off-the-shelf software such as Microsoft Office products.  Recognize common problems with other systems and provide solutions as documented in knowledge base.Reset passwords and assist with sign-on problems.Refer problem tickets with complete documentation to second or third level support personnel as defined in the help desk business processes.
Working Definition of Help Desk Tier Two ServicesThis level of support is where FSC Help Desk tickets are triaged when tickets cannot be resolved at Tier One.  This level consists of Subject Matter Experts in areas outside of the FSC Help Desk, which may be IT related or functional; i.e., (IT, PCS, Payroll, Vendor, Accounting, Health Claims, Facilities Management, etc.)
Questions/issues which cannot be resolved at Tier One level are escalated to Tier Two.  Professionals in Tier Two have greater technical skills to solve specific problems than first level support personnel.  They are considered Subject Matter Experts.Populate applicable problem ticket fields and attach complete documentation.Notification of resolution; i.e., ticket closure, back to Tier One.Update knowledgebase with resolution.
Working Definition of Help Desk Tier Three ServicesThis level of support is not generally provided by the FSC Help Desk.  However, if the call is received by the FSC Tier One Help Desk; they will log the call and attempt to direct the caller to an appropriate resource.
As many calls as possible should be handled by the FSC Help Desk to maintain an accurate record of all service requests.
Help Desk and/or CRM Standard Operating ProceduresFSC Help Desk personnel are expected to follow an established Problem Management Process and utilize the FSC Helpdesk application appropriately and to ensure that all problems are handled in a consistent, repeatable, and predictable manner.  Examples follow:
Acknowledging a service request assigned by the FSC Help Desk entry person.Completing FSC Help Desk log/journal on the status or progress of a ticket at 2 hour intervals.Completing the FSC Help Desk ticket journal upon completion to describe the resolution - this provides a knowledge base of information that can be utilized by all service providers and by the FSC Help Desk support analysts.Providing FSC Help Desk with technical information and problem solving techniques, when requested.  When the FSC Help Desk continuously receives problem calls on certain issues, they may request that additional training, FAQs, information websites, and/or documentation be developed or updated to reflect the types of calls being received.Assisting the Help Desk Manager to resolve escalated problems.  The Help Desk Manager is responsible for assessing the criticality of a given situation or user and appropriately escalating any special situation to an internal service provider.  The Help Desk Manager should exercise discretion in the escalation of any situation - but should expect that the internal service provider will follow through with any FSC Help Desk tickets that are escalated.  This will frequently involve upset customers, VIP customers, or critical infrastructure and application failures that are causing a high volume of FSC Help Desk tickets.Any network configuration changes that are made will be noted on the service request for that particular call.  Information concerning these changes will be shared with all technicians and affected customers, with the work order number referenced, should additional information be needed.

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the services described below:

Statement of Work:

Leadership development is a foundation of succession planning at the National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  The NHLBI Succession Plan focuses on training and development initiatives to prepare high potential employees for leadership roles.  To address the NHLBI leadership development needs in a timely and comprehensive manner and to provide necessary training and experience to high potential leaders resulting in their career growth, the NHLBI has approved a new leadership development program titled the NHLBI Leadership Lab.

The NHLBI Leadership Lab will include traditional cohort learning activities, as well as challenging assignments and management involvement.  The program is designed as a leadership development program that includes nine one-day cohort sessions every three to four weeks over a 7-month period and non-classroom components for 24 participants.

The contractor shall provide leadership development services to enhance leadership competencies and training needs identified by participants and the NHLBI.

Program design must include:

1.	Interest Based Negotiation: Based upon the principles introduced in Roger Fishers seminal text, Getting to Yes, Interest based negotiation is a methodology designed to produce outcomes superior to those typically achieved in position-based negotiation (i.e., negotiations focused on fixed positions and opposing viewpoints, which often result in compromises or impasses).  Interest based negotiation is also designed to improve the efficiency (or reduce the transactional costs) of negotiations and collaborations.

2.	Results Based Accountability TM: Results Based Accountability TM is a framework and set of skills for ensuring both disciplined decision-making and accountability for achieving desired results.  Key principles include the use of (1) data to align day-to-day decision making with the achievement of desired ends and (2) transparency to drive innovation by surfacing and challenging assumptions.

3.	Situational Leadership: Method that instructs NHLBIs managers in the skill of diagnosing an individuals development level on a specific goal or task, then adapting their leadership style to match the situation. It offers a strategy for aligning individual goals to NHLBIs goals.  The role of the situational leader is to provide direct reports with whatever it takesgoals, direction, training, support, feedback, or recognitionto develop their skills, motivation, and confidence.  Situational leadership creates a partnership between managers and staff that enables staff to feel empowered.

4.	Strengths-Based Leadership: Effective leadership is about a leader maximizing their strengths.  According to research conducted by Gallup, effective leaders must know their strengths and invest in others strengths, get people with the right strengths on their group, and understand and meet the four basic needs of those who look to them for leadership

The contractor shall:

	Manage the NHLBI Leadership Lab that results in agile leaders who have the skills to lead in a culture of dynamic change.

<CONTACT>Anthony R. Buch, Contract Specialist, Phone 206-526-6033, Fax 206-527-7752, Email Anthony.R.Buch@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOTICE: THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying sources that are capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with the requirements below.<br />This sources sought notice is for the technical support of ice seal research in accordance with the <br />attached Statement of Work. The work includes, but is not limited to:
<p>The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), conducts research and monitoring on bearded, spotted, ringed, and ribbon seals, species that are protected under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and considered for listing as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). All four species are associated with sea ice during parts of the year, especially during their reproductive periods. Major breeding areas of all four species are found in the western Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Russian Federation. The population sizes in these areas, which are fundamental numbers for evaluating the species' status under the ESA, are extremely imprecise, outdated, or simply unknown.</p>
<p>This work will provide critically needed estimates of the abundance of ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. Aerial photographic and multi-spectral surveys of seals on sea ice shall be designed and conducted by the contractor in a contractor-provided airplane. The multi-spectral imagery shall be analyzed by the contractor for numbers and densities of seals, by species. NMML scientists will combine these results with independent estimates of the proportions of the populations in the water during the aerial surveys (and unavailable for counting) to obtain estimates of total abundance with adequate precision for ESA status evaluations and detection of future population changes in response to climate warming and loss of sea ice.</p>
<p>Approximately 20,000 km of aerial, multi-spectral survey track line will be required in a spring (March-May) survey period in 2012. The vendor must also agree to conduct spring surveys during a second period in 2013 should the government decide to exercise this option. The exact target for track lengths and locations will be determined jointly by the contractor and NMML scientists in a survey design process that considers typical density estimates of these species found in similar surveys conducted recently in U.S. waters. A workshop will be held to facilitate and review the survey design process.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a team with demonstrated experience in multi-spectral (e.g., high-resolution visible, infrared, and ultraviolet) remote sensing of seals on sea ice, and a proven ability to implement a systematic and comprehensive survey of a large region such as an Arctic or sub-Arctic sea. The contractor shall be required to submit draft and final reports describing results of the surveys, with clear and detailed descriptions of how survey observer data, images, track lines, and survey covariates (such as weather and ice conditions) were collected and processed to produce the results.</p>
<p>In addition to conducting the surveys, up to 25 satellite-linked data recorders (SDRs) will be deployed in total on the four species by the fall of 2012. The vendor must also agree to deploy up to an additional 25 SDRs by the summer of 2013 should the government decide to exercise this option. It is expected that the vendor will primarily deploy these tags opportunistically, taking advantage of contacts with local researchers conducting other studies on seals, to avoid or reduce the costs and logistical complexity of dedicated seal tagging operations. Data from the SDRs will be provided to NMML for analysis, to be supplemented by similar data collected by NMML in U.S. studies.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties should submit: 1) A brief description of their capability to provide the required service; 2) Evidence of experience and past performance (including a contact name and telephone number); 3) Intention to submit a proposal as a prime contractor; and 4) Business company size, point of contact and DUNS number. The business size shall include any applicable preference program (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Small Business, etc.) For the purposes of this requirement, the NAICS size standard for small business is $7.0 Million or less.<br />Questions concerning this notice shall be emailed to Anthony.r.buch@noaa.gov Responses shall be submitted via email or facsimile at 206-527-7752 by 12:00 PM March 31, 2011, Pacific Time. This notice is for informational and market research purposes only. Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.</p>

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The Department of State is conducting market research to determine the degree of interest and capability of American small businesses only in providing local guard services to U.S. Embassy Panama City, Panama. The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security plays an essential role in ensuring that foreign policy missions are accomplished in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the local guard services is to provide protection for U.S. personnel, facilities and equipment from damage or loss due to violent attack and theft. The local guards act as an early warning signal to the American Consulate and the RSO. The contractor shall be required to control access to the facilities; protect human life; maintain order, and resist criminal attacks against mission personnel, visitors, and family dependents. The Contractor shall be responsible for responding to intruder alerts by notifying the RSO and following the procedures identified in the General Post Orders and individual Post Orders. The Contractor shall maintain a sufficient number of trained and qualified personnel in order to meet the required hours of operation for each post</p>
<p>The contractor may be required to provide Additional or Emergency Services (A&amp;E) that may stem from such things as a Very Important Person (VIP) visitor, information indicating a possible terrorist attack, or change in threat environment. These changes form the basis for on-going analysis and review of the structure and location of posts as well as the level of security in effect.</p>
<p>Surveillance Detection Operations are discreet and are not to be considered as a replacement for on going efforts by others such as members of the Local Guard Force; they will only supplement activities already in place. Surveillance detection operations are intended to be an early warning mechanism to detect rather than protect. Since coordination and cooperation with host country police and/or security forces will be required, it will be essential for the Contractor to recognize any political sensitivity that may arise in the performance of these operations. The Contractor shall be able to adapt the program to accomplish its objectives while easing any concerns by either the Mission or the host country.</p>
<p>The major duties of a Surveillance Detection Specialist include identifying and immediately reporting suspected surveillance of personnel and facilities, providing protective surveillance of U.S. personnel as directed by the Regional Security Officer (RSO) in his/her capacity as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and assisting the RSO in route planning and analysis.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government will provide the initial Surveillance Detection Training to SD personnel. Thereafter, the Contractor is responsible for providing initial training to new employees as well as conducting SD annual refresher training.</p>
<p>PLANNED ACQUISITION:</p>
<p>The Government will solicit this requirement using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, and the small business size standard is $18,500,000 in average annual receipts. The Government plans to award one for these services.

It shall not be used as a proposal.<br>(c) This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of announcing a workshop 'call for participation', and obtaining feedback on training architectures and technology insertion strategies.<br><br>I.	Introduction<br><br>PM TRADE, in support of the PEO STRI, is soliciting industry, government, and academic participation related to the realization of several architectural evolution strategies across the live, virtual, or constructive training domains. These strategies, which include service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, and virtualization, are capable of improving the interoperability of current and future training systems. The software product-line architecture (PLA) framework paradigm has proven successful in minimizing stovepipe system development, and reducing system life-cycle cost and schedule.  However, as the DoD and Army strive to further reduce system life-cycle costs, and as technology improves, software PLAs must evolve further to align with future acquisition strategies and more easily adapt to advanced technology concepts. <br><br>A 2-day workshop will consist of an information session and facilitated discussion that will address future training architecture needs and strategies. The workshop will be held in Orlando, FL at the Partnership III building in conference room 321A/B on 3 May and 4 May, 2011 from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm each day. Additional details will follow. <br><br>II.	Objective<br><br>The key objective of this workshop is to initiate collaboration and technical exchange between industry, government, and academia involved with SOA, cloud computing, and virtualization activities within training or related initiatives. The workshop will inform stakeholders on current training issues, and architectural strategy concepts, design principles and patterns, governance, infrastructure, relevant standards, and best practices. <br><br>III.

To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.<br> <br>Architecture Workshop RFI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)<br><br>1.	Question: What is the purpose of this workshop?<br><br>Response: The Army CIO/G6 and ASA(ALT) recently published the COE Architecture Guidance memorandum describing the 'End State' Army Enterprise Network Architecture.  The guide recommends the incorporation of SOA, cloud computing, and virtualization concepts and technologies intended to standardize end-user environments and software development kits, establish streamlined enterprise software processes that rely on common pre-certified, reusable software components, and develop deployment strategies that allow the users direct access to new capability. <br><br>Furthermore, PM TRADE and TCM-Live are currently developing the Army's Live Training Campaign Plan.  A major component of the plan is the Live Training architecture evolution strategy and technology insertion migration plan.  The objective of the workshop is to allow an open technical exchange of ideas in developing the evolution strategy and migration plan for future Army Live Training systems, and in support of the Live, Virtual, & Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE).  As such, the Government is exploring lessons learned, best practices, technical expertise, and guidance in consideration of SOA, cloud computing, and virtualization.<br><br>2.	Question: Can we RSVP now and submit survey later?<br><br>Response: Yes, an RSVP can be done as soon as possible.  However, the survey should be submitted by 01 April.  The survey will help identify key working groups based on interest and participant availability.  PM TRADE will publish via email a final list of the working group sessions to registered participants two weeks prior to the workshop's May timeframe.<br><br>3.	Question: Is this a new Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) initiative? <br><br>Response: No.  To clarify, this is not an LVC integrated architecture effort. The workshop will be Live-centric, but all the respective training domains including Virtual and Constructive have architectural objectives to satisfy the Army's Net-centric Enterprise Strategy (NCES) and Common Operating Environment (COE) directives.  The information shared at the workshop will also benefit the Army's Virtual and Constructive domains, and as such, Government technical representatives from each respective domain will participate.  <br><br>4.	Question: Is this a new solicitation for proposals?<br><br>Response: To clarify, this is not a solicitation or request for proposal, but a call for participation in an open technical exchange workshop between government, academia, and industry.  Please see disclaimer on this RFI below:<br><br>FAR 52.215-3; Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)<br>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or to otherwise pay for the information requested.<br>(b) Your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br>(c) This Request for Information is issued for the purpose of announcing a workshop 'call for participation', and obtaining feedback on training architectures and technology insertion strategies.<br><br>Please note that any submitted information received may be shared at the workshop unless the material is clearly marked as "Proprietary".  <br><br>5.	Question: What type/level participants will best meet the purpose of this workshop?  <br><br>Response: Ideal participants include:<br> 	senior architects/engineers who are experienced with establishing architectural evolution strategies and technology migration plans<br> 	technical domain experts that can identify lessons learned, best practices, and benefits in the SOA, cloud computing, and virtualization domains <br> 	technical program managers that can help shape assumptions of applicability to the Live, Virtual, and Constructive training domains, leverage/synchronize with similar DoD initiatives, and recognize expectations with respect to cost, schedule, and performance, or ROI<br><br>The workshop will include guest speakers from industry, academia, and government, active technical working sessions, and working group presentations. After the guest speakers, the plan is to divide participants into several working groups based on topic of interest.  Each working group consisting approximately of 6-10 participants at a round table will be tasked to identify, discuss, and collect information regarding the working group's topic, and present findings/recommendations to the overall group and Government leadership during the out-brief at the end of the second day.<br><br>6.	Question: Our information is proprietary, can we still participate?  <br><br>Response: Yes. If you submit information in response to the RFI that is clearly marked "Proprietary", we will NOT share it at the workshop.  You are still welcome to participate as long as you are able to contribute in an open technical exchange forum.  If you wish to meet solely with the Government to discuss proprietary information, those meetings can be coordinated appropriately after the workshop.

<DESC>Introduction
This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.  
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for a prototype that will create touch screen functionality for VA nurses when triaging patients (#294 VHA/OI&TI). 
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.  VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.
The "Touch Screen Nursing Triage of Patients" is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Currently, the VA has a high volume nationally of patients who are walk-ins to the VA's Emergency Room and Urgent Care Clinic for unscheduled appointments.  Nurses triage these patients quickly and safely in order to initiate their treatment in a timely manner. Triaging entails taking vital signs and obtaining a patient history.  Presently, nurses document these findings in the VA's Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS) progress note screen using keystrokes and mouse clicks.  This process is cumbersome, time-consuming, and not conducive to quickly triaging a high volume of patients.
VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  


Requirements
VA intends to contract for a prototype to develop an application for a touch screen device that interfaces with CPRS and allows nurses to triage patients more efficiently in the Emergency Room Department and Urgent Care Clinics.   The prototype application will allow the nurses to automatically import the vital signs into the triage note, allow nurses to document the history using the touch screen, instead of using keystrokes and mouse clicks, and permit medical orders to be generated based on the history obtained.
Submittal Information
1.	It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information by March 23, 2011 2010.  
2.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.  Specifically, please include any information detailing any prior experience with VistA/CPRS and its associated packages (e.g. Vitals, Problem List, Text Integration Utilities (TIU), Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR)), and any prior information with Touch Screen GUIs.
3.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.
4.	Commercial availability - Description of the length of time your product/solution has been commercially available or, if necessary to modify your commercial product/solution, what is the impact to the commercial price, availability and magnitude of modification.
5.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners certified in VA's VetBiz (www.vip.vetbiz.gov) repository?
6.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  
7.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

Responses are requested no later than close of business on March 23, 2011 via email to joshua.cohen2@va.gov.  This is the second Request for Information issued for this requirement.  The VA requires additional information from the market place in order to devise its acquisition strategy.  Please see the bold/highlighted information found in the Capabilities/Qualification section above.

<DESC>Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Bruker Nano Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer. Bruker Nano can integrate the system being purchased with the system currently at ECBC effectively allows us for both optimized low noise SPM and optimized high resolution SPM without compromise.  Bruker Nano is the only one that offers Peak Force QNM or analogous imaging mode that unambiguously maps quantitative nanomechanical properties, including modulus and adhesion, at high resolution (<10 nanometers) at conventional imaging rates (<10 minutes per image) and over wide modulus range (at least 1 MPa to 50 GPa).  The government's intended use includes, as a primary requirement, rapid, gentle, and quantitative measures of modulus and adhesion; alternate approaches to these measurements are either nonquantitative (Phase Imaging or Pulsed Force), slow (force0volume) or high force (Pulsed Force or nanoindentation).   Additionally, Bruker Nano is the only one offering Peak Force Tapping technology and ScanAsyst, which significantly improve repeatability of results between multiple users and reduce time-consuming tasks associated with determination of operating parameters while using the instrument.The item numbers included in this order are as follows:  ICON-SYS, MPP-22220-10, SANCASYST-AIR, DNP-10, MPP-11100-10, TESP, and MPP-22220-10.This is limited source procurement. Interested parties with questions or comments regarding this notice or the planned procurement should be emailed to gregory.faulcon@us.army.mil by close of business on 22 March 2011.  Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) on behalf of the DOD, Army Material Command, intend to award a sole source contract to the University of Mary Washington (UMW)-Stafford Campus, 121 University Boulevard, Fredricksburg, VA 22406.<br><br>This contract will provide the necessary classroom space and classroom support for the Capital and Northeast Region (CNE) of the Defense Acquisition University (DAU). The period of performance for this contract is 1 April 2011 through 30 September 2011.  The leased classroom space will be used to conduct required courses for the FY11 academic calendar as part of the Directors of Acquisition Career Management (DACMs) input for each Service and the 4th Estate. DAU is responsible for executing the DAWIA training for the Acquisition Work Force within their region. The University of Mary Washington offers existing classroom space that currently meets DAU's space requirements and computer and software requirements. In addition, UMW is currently able to provide the necessary support which is required when offering DAU courses for students in the area.   <br><br>There was a competitive contract in process which has been awarded by GSA for classroom space that will replace the need for UMW. However, that effort has been delayed by Washington Headquarters Service (WHS) and GSA in the post-award administration of the contract. This has necessitated the need for a Bridge Contract to provide additional classroom space to conduct required classes in support of the FY 11 workload while waiting availability of the new facilities, currently scheduled for occupation by 30 Sep 2011. If this action is not accomplished, the impact to the DAU mission of delivering DAWIA courses is significant. Of the 22 class offerings currently scheduled for this site from 1 April, 2011 - 30 Sept, 2011, ALL would be cancelled. The classes cannot be relocated to DAU existing facilities as they are all booked for the year. Additionally, it will add to student backlogs for some of these offerings, further delaying training opportunities to government employees. Harm to the government resulting from delayed acquisition training has the potential to be substantial in the short term and even greater in the long term, therefore directly affecting mission accomplishment. As a result, the government intends to solicit and negotiate the requirement with only once source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br><br>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by 10:00 A.M., 22 March 2011. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous by the Government in future procurements. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br><br>The point of contact for this action is Ms. Charrsi Brightharp, Contract Specialist, (703)-806-4475 or email at charrsi.p.brightharp@us.army.mil.<br><br>Contract Office Address:<br>Mission & Installation Contract Command (MICC) Fort Belvoir<br>9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101<br>Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5134<br><br>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.

<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 30, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC><p>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Education Division has a requirement to provide preschool classrooms with materials that support intentional teaching and purposeful learning of the DoDEA Science Content Standards within a problem-based, project-oriented environment using a Firm-Fixed-Price contract on a sole source basis with Teaching Strategies,7101 Wisconsin Avenue Suite 700, Bethesda Maryland 20814, under the authority of FAR 6.302. DoDEA has a requirement to provide all prekindergarten (PK) students with a quality integrated science program that is consistent with the PK curriculum and assessment system currently utilized in its classrooms. Currently, DoDEA uses Creative Curriculum&reg; for Preschool, and its associated digital assessment system, Creative Curriculum.net. The updated Creative Curriculum&reg; for Preschool, Creative Curriculum&reg; System 5 for Preschool, is a research-based system that uses the studies approach as a method of integrating content learning through children's in-depth investigation of meaningful topics. The program focuses on science and social studies topics while promoting skills in language and literacy, mathematics, technology, and the arts. Teaching Strategies is the sole provider for Creative Curriculum. In order to have consistency in curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the PK integrated science materials must align directly with the current curriculum framework and assessment system utilized in DoDEA preschool classrooms. DoDEA PK classrooms are designed and supported by the Creative Curriculum&reg; framework. Further, Creative Curriculum.net is the assessment system used in DoDEA PK Classrooms. This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, any party that believes it is capable of meeting DoDEA's requirement as stated herein may submit a written capability statement that clearly supports and demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement. All submissions must be received by the response date and time of this notice. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Announcement of Opportunity<br />(RFP) 1410-00004<br />Request for Proposals for providing pH and pCO2 Instruments on Fixed Platforms (OOI)
<p>The Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "Ocean Leadership"), with funding from the National Science Foundation, is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing two classes of instruments--pH instruments (PHSEN) and Partial Pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in water instruments (PCO2W)--and related services to support the objective of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). The OOI will construct a networked infrastructure of oceanic sensor systems to measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor. The measurements of pH and pCO2 in water are vital to our understanding of many of the crucial scientific questions to which the OOI can provide answers.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is seeking firms who are interested in submitting proposals for the PHSEN and PCO2W Instruments. Offerors may submit proposals for either or both of these classes. The selected firm(s) will provide approximately 77 PHSEN Instruments across 5 different series and approximately 35 PCO2W instruments across 2 different series for deployment on fixed platforms at OOI arrays.</p>

For the PHSEN Instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award for all CLINs or up to five single-CLIN awards. For the PCO2W instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award for all CLINs or up to two single-CLIN. Ocean Leadership will not make more than one award for any one series of instruments within an instrument class.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is the only point of contact for this procurement.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors who intend to submit a proposal should plan on participating in an online informational Bidders' Conference (via WebEx) to be held on March 18, 2011.

<DESC>Q.How many candidates will be tested in a given year?  The RFQ mentions that a summary report will be required on all candidates.  Can you provide more information on what is required in the report?  Will the psychologist be required to make a "Pass/Fail" type recommendation or will it be a ranking of candidates.
A. Test numbers per year can range from 2 - 10, and likely average 5 tests for Region 6 per year. The summary report generally contains a paragraph on the "summary of the tests provided",  followed by 7 short paragraphs summarizing the following:  1.  Candor and honesty, 2.  Ability to compete the academy and be trained,  3.  Work Ethic,   4.  Social skills and social interest,  5. Hostilely and anger control,  6 Antisocial attitudes and behaviors, 7 Acting out behavior and safety risk. Each of the 7 categories is followed by a statement by the Doctor stating his opinion:  This candidate is a "Low", "Mild", or "High" risk in this area. The psychologist will not be required to rank candidates.
Q. I would need to be reassured that anything I summarized (as per Item #2 on statement of work) comprise less than 1/3 of the hiring decision input to comply with EEOC guidelines. Also, what is the protection for a consultant if an applicant challenges the summary.
A. The US Fish and Wildlife Service uses 11 functional areas of evaluation for each Law Enforcement Officer candidate.   In fact, the condition of employment letter states that the officer must successfully complete all 11 areas to complete the training regimen.   Pre-employment screening is one of the 11 evaluated criteria used for Officers.  Therefore, it is less than 1/3 of the hiring decision. I do not know the protection for an consultant in the event that an applicant challenges the summary.  I have never had it happen.  My thought is that if the Service accepts the summary, then it becomes our burden, but I do not know that case law.
Q. 1. There are professional guidelines in this field: http://theiacp.org/psych_services_section/pdfs/Psych-PreemploymentPsychEval.pdf  2.  To do an effective and professional evaluation, a face to face interview by a licensed psychologist is required;
A. While I may agree with this vendor that more rigorous standards and procedures could be used to conduct these tests, it is not currently required by the Department Manual for Refuge Officers in the US Fish and Wildlife Service.   See attached Departmental manual.  The manual simply states that we must conduct a psychological screening.  Nationally, all regions are currently using the specifications I provided in the Scope of Work, and my preference is to maintain consistency across the country, and maintain the standards proposed in the scope of work. Face to face interviews are common in many law enforcement agency evaluations.  Again, currently we are not doing this.
Department of the InteriorDepartmental Manual  Effective Date: 10/4/00Series: Law Enforcement and SecurityPart 446: Law EnforcementChapter 2: Personnel Qualifications and StandardsOriginating Office: Office of Managing Risk and Public Safety  446 DM 22.1 Purpose. This chapter establishes the standards, qualifications and procedures for selection, training, performance evaluation, conduct and discipline of its law enforcement personnel.2.2 Selection. It is essential that the selection process utilized throughout the Department of the Interior (Department) be standardized to assure high professional law enforcement standards. Only applicants possessing adequate education and/or experience, aptitude and high moral character shall be employed as law enforcement officers. A. The Office of Managing Risk and Public Safety (MRPS), in conjunction with the Departmental Office of Personnel and the bureaus/offices involved, shall ensure that minimum acceptable standards and skill levels for all law enforcement personnel are instituted. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) approved qualification standards for series GS-1811, GS-1812 and GS-083 will be used as a primary basis in developing Departmental standards for all law enforcement officer positions. As appropriate, bureaus/offices are responsible for establishing necessary supplementary standards to comply with laws, regulations and the specific bureau/office mission objectives.B. Qualification standards for guards shall be used only for those persons hired exclusively to perform guard duties.C. The following medical, physical and psychological requirements shall be applicable:(1) Medical standards for all law enforcement positions shall be in compliance with Federal regulations and shall be established by all bureaus/offices. They will be reviewed and approved by the Federal Medical Officer, through coordination with the Office of the Secretary. Bureaus/offices will require all law enforcement officers under 40 years of age to complete a medical examination biennially. All law enforcement officers 40 years of age and older will complete a medical examination annually.(2) Applicants shall be physically able to perform efficiently the rigorous duties required of a law enforcement officer position. Prior to appointment to a law enforcement position bureaus/offices will require entry level applicants to pass a medical examination, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) Physical Efficiency Battery (PEB), and a psychological screen. These procedures will ensure that law enforcement officers are capable of performing strenuous physical training and law enforcement duties. Applicants shall be disqualified for appointment if they fail to meet any physical requirements or fail to obtain final medical clearance.(3) Bureaus/offices with law enforcement authority will utilize the FLETC PEB to establish minimum physical performance standards. All law enforcement officers will be required to participate in physical training (conditioning). All law enforcement officers will be required to participate in the PEB or an approved wellness program annually. Law enforcement officers assigned to positions deemed by the bureau/office to be sufficiently demanding will be required to meet FLETC minimum scores on the PEB. However, bureaus/offices may require that all law enforcement officers pass the PEB.D. Applicants who qualify in any required written examination and meet the education and/or experience, medical and physical requirements for law enforcement positions shall be personally interviewed. The number of applicants interviewed will be based upon the number of law enforcement positions to be filled. The Law Enforcement Administrator of each bureau/office will designate qualified law enforcement officials to conduct these interviews.E. Entrance and grade levels for the Department of the Interior law enforcement officers shall be comparable to similar positions and duties in other Federal law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement personnel who work longer than their standard shift shall be compensated as appropriate. Each bureau/office shall, as appropriate, develop law enforcement career ladders to meet its needs.

<DESC>USPFO of Louisiana intends to award a sole source procurement to Segovia, Inc., 600 Herndon Pkwy Ste 200, Herndon, VA. The award will be made for the purchase of satellite service for the Broadband Global Area Network<br>(BGAN )Terminal, local area code number assignment for phone service per BGAN terminal. This procurement is being made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) 1 and FAR Part 6.302-1, for other than full and open competition; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is a follow-on contract. To establish a new service contract would result in additional cost associated with the activation of SIM cards, setting up the local area codes, as well as new equipment that would be required for a new vendor. In addition, satellite service requires testing and validation to meet the standards of the NGLA-JIM. Two previous requirements were competed, however Segovia provided the best value to the government in each instance. All qualified sources must respond not later than 21 March 2011, 1100 hours CST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be emailed to COL Patti Woods at patti.woods@us.army.mil  or Mrs. Lucille Howat, at  lucille.howat2@us.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>VESSEL CHARTER TO CONDUCT RESEARCH SURVEY FOR YOUNG OF THE YEAR PACIFIC HAKE AND ROCKFISH SPECIES

<RESPDATE>033111

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies and services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Fisheries Services, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Michael S. Retherford owner of fishing vessel Excalibur. The government intends to acquire supplies and services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will conduct the operations required as part of an ongoing cooperative research survey for young of the year (YOY) Pacific hake and rockfish that began in 1998. This contract will be for one year with no options. This survey will be conducted beginning in early June 2011 and ending in late June 2011, not to exceed 25 days with dates determined by mutual agreement between NMFS and the Contractor. The cruise plan projects 23 days for the survey, including mobilization, survey, vessel inter-comparison, transits and demobilization. The contractor will collect acoustic and biological data. The contractor will provide the survey vessel and vessel crews, and all required vessel equipment to complete the survey in a consistent and scientifically defensible manner to continue a biological time series. <br /><br />The following specific requirements of the survey must be met: Under the direction of a NMFS-designated chief scientist, the vessel will fish in a systematic manner with juvenile trawl gear (Cobb midwater trawl) according to a pre-specified survey design. The operations will be fully defined and discussed during mobilization with the vessel captain(s). With the assistance of the crew, the scientific party will examine and preserve (freeze) the catches and record various biological and effort data. The trawl gear used during the survey will be supplied by the NWFSC. A modified anchovy midwater trawl (Cobb mid-water trawl), the same design used in the SWFSC/SCL pre-recruit survey, has been used since 2001 to obtain samples of juvenile hake and rockfish samples and will be used in 2011. The net has an 86' headrope length and is rigged to fish at 30 m depth. The net tapers from the opening to a cod-end of 1/2" mesh that is lined with a 3/8" mesh liner. Trawling is conducted at night with the headrope at 30 m at a speed of 2.2 to 2.5 kt. Trawl tow duration at depth is 15 minutes, counted from the time the net reaches the 30 m. fishing depth. Project gear will be loaded at the beginning of the charter in Newport, Oregon. At the conclusion of the charter all project gear will be unloaded in Newport Oregon. In the likely event of inclement weather, a "weather day" will be declared. Severe conditions which contribute to unsafe or unpractical survey operations are closely monitored. This decision will be made by the Captain and Chief Scientist after all information and data analysis have been reviewed. Allocating weather days adds time to the charter because stations are not typically dropped. This additional time should be considered when scheduling post-survey vessel operations and will alter the vessel demobilization and charter conclusion. <br />This cooperative research survey has been conducted using the chartered fishing vessel F/V Excalibur in the past and it is in the best interest of the government to continue with the same vessel in order to ensure that the time-series of the data collected is consistent and to ensure that the time-series is not compromised and without jeopardizing the scientific research which is necessary to the commerce of the United States fishing industry through the preservation of sustainable fishing practices. The time series data are necessary to allow NMFS to make scientific determinations about the hake and rockfish species sustainability. <br /><br />
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract, that will commence approximately from date of award through April 2012. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 487210. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government.

Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition.<br /><br />The Western Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER N00164-07-D-6686.

The Government intends to negotiate a modification to existing contract number N00164-07-D-6686 to increase the ceiling value in order to complete current tasks and related tasking that have been started under this contract.
  3 task orders have been awarded to date, with expectation of approximately 1 more award that is a continuation of phased developmental activities in the development of the United States Air Force (USAF) Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) Close Air Support System (CASS) software.  Efforts include development, prototype, test, deployment and support of software releases that enhance the ability of TACPs to interface both with the ground forces they support and the aircraft conducting air operations, as well as with airspace Command and Control (C2) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) organizations.  

The existing contractor is Rockwell Collins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary software/information and expertise of Rockwell Collins, duplicative cost to the Government that it would not expect to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement through any other source.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  All responsible sources may inquire into the specific terms and conditions; such inquiries will be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to increase small business size standards for 35 industries and one sub-industry in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 54, Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and one industry in NAICS Sector 81, Other Services.  As part of its ongoing comprehensive review of all size standards, SBA has evaluated 45 industries and three sub-industries in NAICS Sector 54 and one industry in NAICS Sector 81 to determine whether the existing size standards should be retained or revised.  This proposed rule is one of a series of proposals that will examine size standards of industries grouped by an NAICS Sector.  SBA has issued a White Paper entitled "Size Standards Methodology" and published in the October 21, 2009 issue of the Federal Register a notice that "Size Standards Methodology" is available on its website at www.sba.gov/size for public review and comments.  The "Size Standards Methodology" White Paper explains how SBA establishes, reviews and modifies its receipts based and employee based small business size standards.  In this proposed rule, SBA has applied its methodology that pertains to establishing, reviewing and modifying a receipts based size standard.  SBA included a copy of "Size Standards Methodology" in the same docket file (SBA-2011-0008)
<p>We invite you to review the proposed rule and submit your comments.  The proposed rule explains how to submit your comments.  We recommend that you submit your comments through the Federal eRulemaking Portal: http://www.regulations.gov.  Follow the instructions there for submitting your comments.</p>
<p>The deadline for submission of comments is Monday, May 16, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to release a solicitation to upgrade to the web based version of the Alion CM tool to the incumbent contractor, Alion Science and Technology Corporation, 1759 Tysons Blvd., Suite 1300, McLean, VA 22102. The proposed contract action will provide&nbsp;an upgrade to Air Cargo's current version of the commercial off the shelf (COTS) product CounterMeasures Software, which provides technical integration with other TSA branches that use the CounterMeasures Software, report engineering services, data management services, and project management support.&nbsp; The upgrade will improve data sharing between TSA branches that utilize this software and will enable an enterprise version of CounterMeasures with Multi-Modal modules to be housed on the Transportation Operating Platform (TOP).
<p>A non-competititve contract action is required because the software tool, CounterMeasures, is a licensed product and Alion Science &amp; Technology is the exclusive developer with sole data development rights. It would not be cost effective in terms of time, cost, and effort for TSA to acquire a separate contract to provide/replace the currently utilized software. The period of performance for this sole-source contract will be for 12 months (base year) from the date of award with four one(1) year options.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Electronic Security Systems (ESS) Architect-Engineer (A-E)  contracts increasing shared contract capacity consistent with the terms identified within this announcement. The ESS and Utilities Monitoring and Control System (UMCS) A-E program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price task orders which are placed against four Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts in order to provide quick response for a full spectrum of Architect-Engineer (A-E) services in support of the Electronic Security Center (ESC) and its sister organization, the Utility Monitoring and Control System Mandatory Center of Expertise (UMCS-MCX).  These services are needed to assist with the development of criteria and standards as well as the design, construction, fielding, and evaluation of security systems. The requested A-E Services must be provided on time.  The services and products delivered must be of high quality, technically sound, accurate, thorough, and in full compliance with applicable authorities, standards, policies, regulations, procedures, and guidelines to maintain and further the standing of the ESC as a Center of Expertise.  The A-E contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor .The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these services is 541310.  The A-E shall provide services required for investigation, design, and testing of security systems (to include both ESS and Physical Security Systems), Fire Alarm Systems (FAS); Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditions (HVAC) Systems; Utility Monitoring and Control Systems (UMCS); Security Engineering and other Electrical/Mechanical Design/Criteria Development, and Other Automated Control Systems and Miscellaneous Security Studies.  This effort includes, but is not limited to, research, investigate and develop design criteria; investigating site conditions; investigating conditions of system inoperability and recommending solutions; preparing design packages and criteria documents; reviewing current criteria and designs; participating in factory test, field test, and engineering surveys; conducting state-of-the-art engineering analysis and other special studies; and providing other engineering functions as described in annexes and referenced documents to be added to the contract.   Additionally, the contracts require the handling and generation of classified information. The services may call for extensive domestic and foreign travel. All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures. The ordering period for these contracts is to expire in 28 October 2012. As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on ESS A-E acquisitions, under NAICS code 541310. A Sources Sought for the follow-on acquisitions was released on 16 February 2011, under solicitation number W912DY-11-R-0010. Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the contract capacity be increased to provide adequate support for Program requirements until the end of the contracts ordering period. Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current ESS A-E contracts to increase contract capacity by $5 million. Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.<br><br>The programmatic capacity for the current contracts is $12 million encompassing a total possible four (4) year ordering period (one (1) base year and three (3) one-year option periods). This capacity was established based on an analysis of the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work, and upon historical ESS contract/program data. Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contracts despite any remaining capacity.<br><br>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows: W912DY-09-D-0002 (Black & Veatch), W912DY-09-D-0003 (C.H. Guernsey & Co.), W912DY-09-D-0004 (Allsbrook Goodman, Inc.), and W912DY-09-D-0005 (Combs & Shearer Inc.). The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged. <br><br>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy requirement. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances. Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified. The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding. The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include pricing information which includes profit rate, overhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates; business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Ms. Wanda Hampton via email at Wanda.H.Hampton@usace.army.mil or Ms. Geordelle Brown via email at Geordelle.L.Brown@usace.army.mil. <br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This synopsis is notification of the Governments intent to modify its Full Food Services Contract, Number W9124B-05-D-0001, at Fort Irwin, California.  Modification is to extend the period of performance from 31 March 2011 through 29 February 2012.  This increase has become necessary due to unanticipated delays in the ongoing pre-award process for a follow-on contract.  Without this modification, Fort Irwin will not have a contract vehicle in place and a delay would adversely impact Fort Irwin's ability to meet critical installation support services during the re-solicitation of the follow-on contract.  A determination not to compete this requirement is anticipated to be made pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (C) (1) and FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation for offers.  No award will be placed solely on the basis of this notice, since synopsis of intent to place an order cannot be considered a request for proposals or offers.  Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bon-a-fide competition exists and whether a request for proposal is appropriate or feasible.  Response to this notice must be made within seven (7) calendar days after the posted date.   Fort Irwin's new competitive follow-on contract is currently being prepared by the MICC-Fort Sam Houston Directorate of Contracting, for a base plus four one year option periods.

<p>The Solicitation number is: OPM23-11-T-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-48 dated January 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 561990, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM), Employee Services (ES) provides policy direction and leadership in designing, developing and promulgating Government-wide human resources systems and programs for recruitment, pay, leave, performance management and recognition, employee development, work/life/wellness programs and labor and employee relations; provides technical support to agencies regarding the full range of human resources management policies and practices, to include veterans' employment and agency program evaluation; and manages the operation of OPM's internal human resources program.</p>
<p>ES's Recruitment and Hiring designs, develops, and promulgates merit-based employment systems, policies, regulations, and programs that Federal agencies use to recruit, examine, hire, classify and assess high quality employees from diverse backgrounds. Recruitment and USAJOBS&reg;, a sub-component of ES, is responsible for designing, developing, and managing USAJOBS, Student Programs, and Diversity Policy and Outreach. Specifically, Student Programs is responsible for Government-wide student programs, such as Student Educational Employment Programs (STEP/SCEP), Presidential Management Fellows (PMF), and for building a "student ambassador" and "college recruitment" program.</p>
<p>Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years. The PMF Program brings in graduate degree candidates from diverse educational backgrounds into the Federal government.</p>
<p>The Program is highly selective and competitive. In 2010, less than 900 applicants were selected as Finalists out of an applicant pool of nearly 9,000. After being deemed a Finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal department or agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the Program, PMFs can be noncompetitively converted to career civil service status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>The PMF Job Fair is an annual event sponsored by OPM's PMF Program Office to facilitate the placement of PMF Finalists with Federal Agencies. This event is by invitation only for 2011 Finalists and participating Federal Agencies. In addition, a Graduation Ceremony will be held for Presidential Management Fellows completing their fellowship from the Class of 2008.</p>
<p>In support of its mission and goals, the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program has a need for a vendor to provide tradeshow and event planning services in support of the PMF Job Fair and Graduation Ceremony to be held in mid to late April 2011 or early May 2011, at a soon-to-be determined venue in Washington, DC. The contractor shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government. The period of performance shall be from date of award through May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Contracting Group in response to this notice by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), March 23, 2011. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Benjamin.Delaney@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at benjamin.delaney@opm.gov through 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), <br />March 21, 2011. Note that communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in the cancellation of the requirement.</p>
<p>Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is to be awarded will not be considered. Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov. Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Dressing Tape. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is July 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Point of <strong>Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and 202-782-3663.<br /></strong><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Dressing Tape. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,676,033.43. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top twenty two (22) line items of the total seventy five (75) line items, account for 79.9% ($1,338,807.19) of the total volume in sales ($1,676,033.43) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 10 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO North via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br /></strong>The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendors must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendors who do not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The eight (8) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement:<br /><br />1.

Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.&nbsp; (Note: vendor who fails to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative). Vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendor MUST provide literature that clearly identifies that the products' packaging are clearly labeled, has manufacturing lot number and expiration date on packaging with initial submittal. A vendor whose products cannot identify these features or vendor who does not provide documents to support this with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />6. Vendor MUST provide Surgical Dressing Tape that is waterproof and breathable to allow air to reach the skin in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. Vendor must provide documents to support waterproofing with initial submittal. Vendor whose products cannot be identified with these features or vendor who does not provide documents to support these requirements will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />7. Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free and hypoallergenic tape products.

<p><strong>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br /></strong>Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO North, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO North verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Six (6) samples of each type and length listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>Silk-type made of Premium Silk-type material tape in 3inch widths<br />Cloth-type made of Premium Cloth-type material tape in 4inch widths<br />Plastic-type made of Premium Plastic- type material tape in sizes 1inch widths<br />Foam (stretched/elastic) made of Premium Foam-type material tape in 3inch widths</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. <br />The MMESO TPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified or has not been selected will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (CAC approval of selection). Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each requirement for Surgical Dressing Tape will be evaluated by two (2) trials per evaluator (each clinical trial site will have at least three (3) clinical evaluators who will each evaluate all samples), in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <br />There will be approximately eighteen (18) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Efficiency of Care) Surgical Dressing Tape tears easily in multiple directions. <br />2. (Efficiency of Care/Infection Control NPSG.07.05.01/Patient Safety) Surgical Dressing Tape adhesive adheres well to dressing/skin. <br />3. (Efficiency of Care) Surgical Dressing Tape is easy to manipulate while wearing medical gloves. <br />4. (Efficiency of Care/Patient Comfort/Safety/Infection Control NPSG.07.05.01) Surgical Dressing Tape adhesive maintains the integrity of the skin during and after removal. <br /><br /><strong>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br /></strong>Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing must be received at the MMESO North by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***<br />***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-47.***<br />*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted, and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***<br /><br /><br />PURPOSE:<br /><br />The Magnetics Group requires a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance--(NMR) system upgrade. Currently, we use an antiquated hybrid (Bruker-Tecmag) NMR spectrometer console which is fundamentally limited by the electronics available at the time of its manufacture. A modern spectrometer would allow us to continue using our current NMR superconducting magnet, room temperature shims and probe, while simultaneously expanding our capabilities to include the use of magnetic field gradients for the purpose of diffusion measurements and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (specifically MRI microimaging). In addition, the improved electronics of a new spectrometer will better enable us to use our cryogen-free magnet for NMR and MRI, as well as opening up a range of NMR and MRI techniques currently unavailable due to the limitations of the current spectrometer. These capabilities are in line with the goals of the BioMagnetic Imaging Program within the Magnetics Group, which is actively working on diffusion phantoms for quantitative MRI standards, as well as complimenting efforts in NMR/MRI microcoil design. Because of our interest in quantitative measurements at clinical MRI field strengths (1.5, 3, and 7 tesla), it is important that a new console being able to function at these field strengths.</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; 
52.209-5, Certification Regarding 
52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 
52.212-2  INSTRUCTIONS AND EVAL CRITERIA
In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation  Commercial Items (Jan 1999), the Government will award a Task Order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1: Past Performance
Factor 2: Price 

Factors will be weighted as follows:

o	The Past Performance factor is more important than the Cost/Price submission.
o	All non-price factors, when considered together are more important than price.

Each Offeror will submit proposals consisting of Past Performance and Price which clearly articulates their understanding, and ability to comply, with the requirements of the PWS.

Factor 1: Past Performance - In order to facilitate the Governments evaluation of this factor, the Offeror shall provide information on no more than three (3) previous contracts whose effort was relevant to the effort required by this solicitation; the contracts provided should have been performed within the last five (5) years.
  Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed.  Yet-to-be performed work and experience prior to the last 5 years will not be considered.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this RFP.  The Government may verify past performance information.  The Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and may collect information through questionnaires, telephone interviews and existing data sources to include but not limited to Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting (CPARS). The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
 This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance.

Past performance will be evaluated based on the relevance and quality of the submitted contracts information.     
	
Relevance is determined by a contracts similarity to the current requirement, based upon scope and magnitude.  For the purposes of this evaluation, relevancy in scope and magnitude are measured by the following: 

Scope:  Experience in the areas defined in the PWS.
	
Magnitude:  The measure of the similarity of the dollar value of actually performed work that exists between the PWS and the Offerors contract.  Magnitude will be evaluated on the dollar amount of work actually performed under the contract or contracts during the relevant five-year period established by the solicitation.
  

The quality evaluation will be based on the following sub factors: Quality, Timeliness, and Contractor Responsiveness which are of equal importance.

	Quality: The Offerors demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of:
	Overall customer satisfaction,
	Instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and 
	Evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer
	Timeliness: The Offerors compliance with:
	Delivery and/or performance schedules,
	Timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing
	Contractor Responsiveness:  The Offerors demonstrated ability to: 
	Respond to customer concerns,
	Isolate and resolve problems, and take systematic improvement action

Following the quality evaluation, the Contracting Officer will assign an overall adjectival rating to each contract, considering both the contracts relevance and quality.
 The Contracting Officer will then assign a composite past performance adjectival rating for the Offerors overall past performance, considering the ratings assigned to each individual contract.
1) Past Performance submission is limited to 6 pages. Information provided beyond 6 pages will not be considered.  
i)  Past Performance shall, at a minimum, provide the following information: 
	Contract Number/Delivery Order Number 
	Contract Type 
	Contract Period of Performance
	Program Name 
	Total Contract Cost 
	Brief description of work performed 
	Valid name, phone number and email of Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer Representative/Technical Point of Contact. It is incumbent upon Offerors to ensure they are providing a valid names, phone numbers and email addresses.
  References who cannot be contacted will receive a neutral rating. 

Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will receive a Neutral rating. 

Factor 2: Price:  The Offerors price submission shall include a complete and signed solicitation form, and if applicable, and executed copy of Amendments.  The Government will evaluate pricing information submitted in accordance with the solicitations INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS by comparing it to other Offerors prices or by using any other price comparison technique deemed to be in the Governments best interest by the Contracting Officer.

The contract will consist of:
	a Firm-Fixed priced CLIN to provide monthly preventative maintenance;
	a Firm-Fixed priced CLIN to provide monthly help desk support;
	a COST CLIN for emergency and other repairs identified during routine maintenance 

for the electronic surveillance camera systems for a period of 1-year, and will include options CLINS to continue such services on a yearly basis thereafter.
 

Although price is the least important factor, the degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the offers in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be made.  Price will be evaluated by the contracts personnel to determine fairness and reasonableness through the most appropriate method available. 

1) The price submission is not page limited, but is strictly limited to price and cost information. The submission shall include:
i)  Supporting information including:  Labor Categories, Labor Rates, Hours and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) used in developing the proposed price.  
ii)  Price submission shall include proposed labor rates for repairs identified in para 4.3 of this PWS.
 These rates shall be utilized when repairs to the electronic surveillance camera equipment are required.
 
Scoring/ Rating:  All evaluation criteria except price will be subject to the following ratings.  Evaluations shall employ a letter grade method for rating Contractor submissions against evaluation factors identified within the solicitations.  The appropriate letter grade rating shall be assigned to each factor subsequent to and consistent with the narrative evaluation, which shall indicate a proposal's strengths, weaknesses, and risks.  A quote need not have all of the characteristics of a grade category in order to receive that grade rating; evaluators should use judgment to rate the proposal using these characteristics.

Brand Name Justification:
The Puget Sound Naval Shipyard has a requirement to purchase additional SUN PCI-E Dual 10 GigE Fiber XFP Low Profile Adapters, LR-XFP Transceivers and premium support to complete the installation of New Sun Equipment and Storage.

The additional accessories must be Sun in order to maintain warranty and premium support. The accessories will be compatible with Sun Configuration and meet Puget Sound Naval Shipyards current architecture standard.

The existing platform is already credited so going to a non-accredited system would create significant rework for all channels of Navy network security.
 Standardization plays a key role in the efficiency of our network operation. Hardware deviation creates more work in operating system and application support.

Different brands have different operating systems therefore potential security risks can be interjected. Therefore to maintain network integrity, operational readiness, minimal maintenance and training costs, it is essential that the accessories and support are Sun.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>OFDA's Office of the Director assists the DCHA front office, the OFDA Director and OFDA Deputy Director with tracking trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field, recommends strategies for action, and maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors. OFDA's Humanitarian Policy and Multi-lateral Affairs team comprises senior Humanitarian Advisors located in Brussels, Geneva, New York and Rome coordinated by OFDA/Washington's Office of the Director. The Humanitarian Advisor for the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN) will be part of the humanitarian policy team within the Office of the Director.</p>

<p>Created in 1947 by the United Nations Participation Act, the USUN assists the President and the Department of State (DOS) in conducting United States (U.S.) policy at the United Nations (UN). An important function of the USUN is to keep the DOS informed of events at the UN. USUN officers report on meetings and make recommendations to DOS as to what course of action the U.S. should pursue. This information is also relayed to overseas American Embassies which have an interest in particular items under UN consideration. The USUN is also a link between the U.S. Government (USG) and the UN Secretariat. The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) maintains a liaison at the USUN to help provide humanitarian operational experience at USUN, represent USAID's views and interests on humanitarian assistance issues and to report to the USG on the proceedings of UN activities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To assign a Humanitarian Advisor to the USUN in New York as the senior advisor and USUN authority on humanitarian affairs.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Advisor serves as an authoritative source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for USUN Ambassadors and staff. He/She will help plan USUN strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively lobby members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaison with the UN Secretariat and the representational offices in New York of UN specialized agencies; negotiate resolutions in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and anticipate and prepare documents, briefing memos and statements for USUN Ambassadors for important meetings and events. The Humanitarian Advisor will also raise critical issues with the UN on behalf of OFDA, DCHA offices and other USG agencies as time permits and must have the ability to multi-task.</p>
<p>The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area. The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data that is often vague, unsubstantiated or contradicts existing knowledge. The Humanitarian Advisor will receive general guidance but will be expected to execute independent judgment and analysis.</p>
<p>The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the USG. It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent official assessments of complex issues and keep the policy-making and foreign affairs communities continuously informed of new issues and developments.</p>
<p>Contacts will be with the DOS and USAID employees at all levels, both in New York and Washington, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, congressional staff, experts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting. Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions. Although guidance on the U.S. position on specific issues will be provided, the Humanitarian Advisor may be called upon to handle unexpected inquiries. The Humanitarian Advisor post is organizationally located within OFDA's Office of the Director while physically located at the USUN offices in New York City.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Advisor's duties and responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the authoritative USUN New York source of all humanitarian policy information for the Permanent Representative, other USUN Ambassadors and USUN staff;<br />&bull; Serve as an active member of the USUN team and advise the U.S. Permanent Representative and the Representative and Deputy Representative to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on the initiation, formulation and impact of policy positions and developments;<br />&bull; Coordinate with the DOS and USAID to obtain detailed guidance on the USG position pertaining to UN resolutions.<br />&bull; Anticipate the needs of the Ambassadors regarding developments in the areas of humanitarian affairs and prepare analyses, briefings, documents and meetings;<br />&bull; Prepare the Ambassadors to speak on critical subjects before the Security Council, UN General Assembly, ECOSOC and in other UN bodies;<br />&bull; Analyze and critique UN proposals for the Ambassador and DOS and, as necessary, draft or negotiate alternative proposals;<br />&bull; Provide leadership for the identification, research, analysis and development of recommendations on all issues and matters relating to humanitarian affairs and anticipate the need for such policy analysis;<br />&bull; Develop recommendations for U.S. action and positions, including specific proposals to the U.S. Representative and other USG representatives for appropriate U.S. positions in the UN;<br />&bull; Assist USUN and DOS Officers in the development of appropriate guidance and voting instructions and prepare major policy speeches, briefing/background papers and statements/talking points;<br />&bull; Represent the U.S. in meetings of the UN General Assembly, ECOSOC and other UN bodies as directed; actively lobby members of other UN delegations and closely liaise with the UN Secretariat to develop consensus for U.S. positions; and negotiate resolutions, statements and agreements on relevant issues and matters under the guidance of the DOS' Bureau for International Organizations;<br />&bull; Negotiate humanitarian resolutions with other member states in the United Nations, on behalf of the U.S. Government.<br />&bull; Attend various UN, USUN, UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG), Humanitarian Liaison Working Group (HLWG) and other meetings and provide authoritative information and views to formulate policies and coordinate strategies on policy issues;<br />&bull; Enunciate USUN views and report on decisions taken;<br />&bull; Initiate and maintain strong working relationships with other diplomatic missions in order to promote consensus for voting, report on positions of other delegations, negotiate positions and coordinate activities;<br />&bull; Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with other USUN components and relevant USG offices;<br />&bull; Answer relevant congressional and public inquiries and speak to various visiting groups through the USUN's public affairs program and in consultation with USAID; <br />&bull; Provide back-up representation for development and post-conflict issues, including transition from relief to development, during the absence of other USUN officers;<br />&bull; Represent DCHA on specific humanitarian issues of concern with UN agencies in New York and convey demarche messages as needed;<br />&bull; On behalf of OFDA, attend key donor forums in New York, including but not limited to, the OCHA Donor Support Group, Humanitarian Liaison Working Group, and country-specific working groups. <br />&bull; Assist other USG agencies on areas of concern.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>2- As per conversation with Legal, these bikes are using Commercial Off The Shelf technology hence not subject to Buy American Act</p>
<p>3- To clarify which specific model we are looking for, it is the Keiser M3 or a bike with equal characteristics. You can submit a bid for that same model OR a indoor cycle with similar specifications. Also note that award will be made in all, aggregate or none.</p>

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;5352.242-9000 Contractor access to Air Force installations. <br />As prescribed in 5342.490-1, insert a clause substantially the same as the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and State Police Background Check to obtain a vehicle pass.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>
<p>(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>
<p>(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.</p>
<p>(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>C.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Highway Institute is the technical training arm of the Federal Highway Administration, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA's overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies. The target audience is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States. In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended message.</p>
<p>The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-led, classroom training on a broad range of topic areas since it was established by congress in 1970. However, the electronic era has rapidly opened new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time.</p>
<p>The typical types of courses currently being offered or under development, the course objectives, and the target audiences are described on the NHI website at http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/.</p>
<p>C.2 CONTRACT OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to effectively and efficiently develop and deliver a timely program of high quality training in the broad general areas of Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering.</p>
<p>C.4 SCOPE</p>
<p>The scope of this contract is limited to the development, revision, promotion, and delivery of training in the broad subject areas of Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering technologies.</p>
<p>This may also include any research required for the development of a specific course, reference manuals, and other support services that may be required for the promotion of the training program.</p>
<p>C.5 TECHNICAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Task Orders under this ID/IQ contract will be determined and issued on an as needed basis by the FHWA.</p>
<p><br />C.6 KICK-OFF MEETING,</p>
<p>If requested by the Government, the contractor shall attend a Kick-off meeting for approximately 2, 4, or 6 hours, which will include the following attendees: the contractor's key personnel, including the Program Manager, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), and additional FHWA support staff. The Contracting Officer and the cognizant contract administration may also attend the meeting. <br /><br />The purpose of the Kick-off Meeting is to introduce the contractor and Government teams as well as to provide background information, clarify course content issues, define roles and responsibilities, establish timelines and respond to questions. This meeting is generally held at the NHI Office in Arlington, VA.</p>
<p>[Offerors shall include prices for a 2-hour, a 4-hour, and a 6-hour kickoff meeting in person in Arlington, VA and via web conference or videoconference.]</p>
<p>C.7 TASK AREAS</p>
<p>[Note: Offerors are not required to propose to all subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical Engineering technologies), and may limit their proposal to selected subject areas based on their strengths/capabilities; however, the Government places a greater value on proposals that provide coverage to a greater number of subject areas than on proposals that provide coverage on only a few tasks.]</p>
<p>This section describes the specific tasks to be addressed and the technical skills necessary and associated with each of the subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical Engineering technologies).</p>
<p>Specific work to be performed will be set forth under individual Task Orders. However, Task Orders will generally consist of work in the following areas (Section C.7.1 - C.7.8):</p>
<p>C.7.1 TRAINING NEEDS ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS</p>
<p>The NHI's goal is to optimize the training for maximum effectiveness ensuring the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. This process also involves development of material precisely targeted to student needs. Furthermore, even though achieving a true measurement of the effectiveness of training can be elusive, it is desirable to obtain accurate feedback from course participants and supervisory staff. Work under this task area may be issued to may include, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Conducting market research of short and long term training needs of all or specified segments of target audiences for the topic areas identified in the Task Order.</p>
<p>(2) Conducting market research of target audiences to determine specific training needs, course objectives and learning outcomes for identified target areas.</p>
<p>(3) Conducting and analyzing post course evaluations to determine effectiveness of delivery methods, course content, and instructional presentation in accomplishing the training objectives.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluating and proposing alternative delivery strategies and learning environments that encourage greater participation and knowledge transfer from the learning environment into the workplace.</p>
<p>C.7.2 TECHNICAL REVIEW AND PANEL COORDINATION</p>
<p>The quality of NHI courses is improved if the interests of selected groups are represented on panels that will provide comments during the course development process. Their review of curriculum material as it evolves can be invaluable. Work under this task area may include, but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing and coordinating panels that represent the FHWA, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and other public and private sector organizations, or individuals to review and provide comments on training needs, curriculum development, and course presentation activities.</p>
<p>C.7.3 COURSE DEVELOPMENT, REVISION, AND UPDATE</p>
<p>The NHI offers a constantly changing array of courses. Some of the courses may need minor revision, while others may require major updating to stay abreast of current technology. In addition, new design procedures, changing specifications, research results, emerging technologies, new regulations, computer programs, etc. continually precipitate the need to develop entirely new courses. In other instances, it may be desirable to convert existing material into a more appropriate format that allows for course participation at a distance.</p>
<p>The NHI's goal is to optimize training for maximum effectiveness, ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. This process involves development of material precisely targeted to participant needs and providing clearly articulated Learning Outcomes. The principles of adult learning and Instructional System Design shall be incorporated into each course, as well as a learning assessment (i.e. pre and post tests, exercises, skill demonstration, etc) in order to be consistent with IACET (International Association of Continuing Education and Training) requirements. The training shall include a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, group exercises/discussions, and interactive technology that enhances participation (such as audience response systems, etc). The training shall also be learner-centric and not instructor-centric.</p>
<p>Adult Learning Considerations</p>
<p>Before revising, developing, or presenting any training program targeted at adult audiences, it is first useful to gain an appreciation of the difference between child-centered learning and adult- centered learning. Almost all of us have experienced 12 or more years of education as children and many of us have experienced additional years of education as young adults. The educational models fixed in our minds are the pedagogical models-- the art and science of teaching children--drawn from those experiences. As adult trainers, it is easy for us to teach as we were taught rather than implement good adult learning principles.</p>
<p>We know the following things about adult learners:</p>
<p>&bull; Adults have a need to know why they should learn something. One of the first tasks of the adult trainer is to develop a "need to know" in the learner - to demonstrate the value of what is being offered to them.<br />&bull; Adults have a deep need to be self-directed. However, often when they enter a program labeled "education" or "training" they revert back to their conditioning as children, put on their hats of dependency, fold their arms, sit back and say, "Teach me." This puts them at immediate odds with their need for self-direction, causes inner conflict and a resistance to participation in training. To resolve this as adult trainers we must help adult learners make a quick transition from seeing themselves as dependent learners to becoming self-directed.<br />&bull; Adults have a greater volume and different quality of experience than children. Adults bring into the learning situation a background of experience that is itself a rich resource for many kinds of learning for themselves and others. Adults have a broader base of experience to which to attach new ideas and skills and give them richer meaning. The greater experience, however, also has a potential negative consequence. The greater experience can cause people to develop habits of thought and bias, to make presuppositions, to be less open to new ideas. Evidence indicates that this phenomenon is especially characteristic of undereducated adults.<br />&bull; Adults become ready to learn when they experience in their life situation a need to know or be able to do in order to perform more effectively and with greater satisfaction. Adults learn best when they choose voluntarily to make a commitment to learn.<br />&bull; Adults enter into a learning experience with a task-centered (or problem-centered) orientation to learning. Adult learning activities are better received when designed around tasks, problems, or life situations. Very often, if they can apply what they have learned to a recent experience or situation, they can better appreciate the newfound knowledge and skills.<br />&bull; Adults are motivated to learn by both extrinsic and intrinsic motivators. The problem is they may not be motivated to learn what we want to teach them, hence the importance to develop "a need to know" as a basic ingredient of adult training. The most potent and persistent motivators for adults are intrinsic motivators such as self-esteem, broadened responsibilities, power, and achievement.</p>
<p>Implications for Practice</p>
<p>Adult learning concepts--combined with an understanding of the training need--suggest the following approach to course design:</p>
<p>&bull; Participants want to have a chance to tailor knowledge to their local situation.<br />&bull; Participants want to have an opportunity to interact with others during the training session.<br />&bull; Participants want to understand why something is important.<br />&bull; Participants have a need for training that will demonstrate the benefits of learning.</p>
<p>Learner-Centric Instruction</p>
<p>In an effort to make training more effective and move the content into working environments, the NHI believes in learner-centric instruction. The core principles for learner-centric instruction are those in which learners, with a facilitator's guidance, are made responsible for constructing their own comprehension and potential usage of the course content. As the term implies, it is an instructional approach in which the learner is placed at the center of training. In such a setting, the individual involvement of the learners in the learning process is emphasized through their active participation in building up knowledge and understanding. Instructors play a facilitatory role in the process. The main players and constructors of knowledge and learning experiences are the learners themselves.</p>
<p>There are actually three ultimate goals that are ideally reached through learner-centered strategies. They are:</p>
<p>1. The development of inquiry and problem solving skills<br />2. The development of deep understanding of topics and<br />3. The development of democratic processes (e.g. critical examination of our own and other's positions)</p>
<p>Learning environments are contextualized to meet the real learning needs of the learners. This means that learners are provided with authentic learning experiences and activities that require an understanding similar to the one required in real world settings. Additionally, the learning environment is set to accommodate a variety of instructional tools and methods as well as flexible arrangements of time and place. Learning centered approaches cater to the diversity of participants' abilities and learning modalities and attempt to attend to participants' varying learning needs. Learner-centered approaches are best applied to invoke higher-level thinking, inquiry, and problem solving skills. What is at the essence of the learner-centered approach is that learners are internally motivated and are active participants in the knowledge gain process mediated through personal and interpersonal interactions.</p>
<p>Examples of learner-centered educational practices include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborative group learning, both inside and outside the classroom <br />&bull; Individual participant research and discovery<br />&bull; Research and discovery by participants and teacher together <br />&bull; Problem-based inquiry learning<br />&bull; Participant-teacher studio and performance activities <br />&bull; Hands-on, experiential learning activities<br />&bull; On-site field experiences<br />&bull; Self-paced tutorials</p>
<p>Learning Assessment</p>
<p>The NHI is approved to award International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) continuing education units (CEUs) and as such, follows Bloom's Taxonomy of learning levels including associated outcome and assessment development. As part of a continuous improvement process and to conform to IACET standards, NHI has instituted a course design policy to include a post-course assessment. Selection of this learning evaluation tool is an Instructional Systems design (ISD) decision and shall be designed to measure participant performance with the course learning outcomes. Acceptable tools include case studies, skills demonstrations, and objective tests.</p>
<p>To this end, the contractor shall develop "end of course assessments" that fully measure mastery of each overall course learning outcome (a Kirkpatrick Level II evaluation), but not necessarily each lesson outcome. The assessment shall form a comprehensive end of course evaluation of the participant's retention of critical skills and knowledge for successful job performance after training.</p>
<p>Participants should be able to complete the assessment within 45 minutes. Time to administer the test shall be reflected in the course agenda. In developing the assessment tools, the contractor shall include objective measures such as multiple choice questions, matching questions, or methods that require critical thinking such as case studies or skills demonstrations. Subjective formats such as case studies shall have clearly stated response criteria or parameters to reduce subjectivity when evaluating participant responses. The assessments shall be designed so that a score of 70 is considered "passing."</p>
<p>Tests are used to measure and document a student's knowledge, cognitive ability, and performance of job tasks. The specific type of test item to use should be determined by the behavior specified in the outcome to be tested and the instructional delivery system used. Various types of test items as described below, may be used to document and measure the specified criteria:</p>
<p>Test Item Type Characteristics <br />Multiple-choice &bull; Useful for testing knowledge and cognitive abilities. <br />&bull; Consists of a stem and four responses. <br />Matching &bull; Useful for testing terms and labels. <br />&bull; Consists of two columns of related words, phrases, or symbols to be matched by the student. <br />True/False &bull; Useful for testing knowledge. <br />&bull; Consists of a single statement. <br />&bull; Not more than 10% of questions may be True/False<br />Completion or "fill in the blank" &bull; Useful for testing recall of knowledge committed to memory. <br />&bull; Consists of a statement from which a word(s) or short phrase has been omitted. The student must supply the missing word(s) or phrase in the blank(s) provided. <br />Performance &bull; Useful for testing job tasks and skills. <br />&bull; Consists of a simulated or actual environment with certain conditions of performance and certain expected outcomes.</p>
<p>When so specified in a Task Order, the contractor shall develop the required test items, and all required supplemental materials (e.g., instructions for the instructor, instructions for the student, scoring procedures, answer key, etc.). Delivery and review of test items will coincide with delivery of draft course materials.</p>
<p>The number of test items shall be sufficient to adequately measure a student's mastery of each course learning outcome. The contractor shall develop, when so specified in a Task Order, at least 3 versions of each test.</p>
<p>Task Orders</p>
<p>Under each task area, work may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Developing, revising, or updating curriculum material including course outlines, instructor guides, participant notebooks, reference manuals, and visual aids using innovative methods of increasing participation of course participants.</p>
<p>&bull; Developing new or converting existing curriculum material into a format that can be delivered by distance learning such as through web-conferencing, web-based, or other electronic medium using innovative methods of increasing participation of course participants.</p>
<p>Individuals involved in an NHI course development include the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the Technical Review Team (i.e. FHWA technical lead contact, other agency representatives, target audience reps, stakeholders, etc) and the Contractor Project Team (both subject matter experts and instructional systems designers). The stages in an NHI course development process, include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) Kick-off Meeting</p>
<p>The kick-off meeting typically includes the following attendees: the contractor's key development personnel, including the contractor's Instructional System Designer (for course development task orders), the COTR, the FHWA technical review panel and the Contracting Officer, if available. The purpose of the Kick-off Meeting is to introduce the team, review the scope of the task order, provide background information, review course and reference manual draft outlines, clarify course content issues, define roles and responsibilities, establish timelines and respond to questions. This meeting is generally held at the NHI facility in Arlington, VA.</p>
<p>For any course development Task Orders awarded under this contract, the contractor shall prepare the agenda for each kickoff meeting, lead the discussion, prepare, and deliver minutes to demonstrate understanding of key decisions and to solicit approval of understanding as needed.</p>
<p>The contractor shall bring to each course development kick-off meeting the draft course and reference manual outlines and a work plan/schedule, and be prepared to lead a discussion of their ideas for updating the course and reference manuals.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also be prepared to discuss the development and review schedule for all deliverables, by Task. The schedule shall be determined at this meeting. Further, the timeframe for the various technical reviews, progress meetings, walkthroughs, and the Pilot Course delivery shall also be discussed and agreed upon at this meeting. Once agreed to, the schedule will become a part of the task order and may thereafter only be changed by the Contracting Officer. The specific details for Kick-off meetings will be included in each Task Order proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Progress Meetings</p>
<p>These are generally one-day in length, and scheduled as needed during the development process. At Progress meetings, the COTR and the Technical Review Team discuss relevant technical issues in the course materials, based upon government comments previously provided; determine if course development is proceeding in the right direction; review course content; discuss suggested course delivery techniques (e.g. group exercises, a case study, a computer application, etc); suggest materials for the reference manual; and, resolve any issues that arise. The contractor shall provide electronic files for the DRAFT presentation deliverables as specified in the task order at least one day in advance of the progress meetings.</p>
<p>The contractor shall prepare the agenda for each meeting, lead the discussion, prepare and deliver minutes to demonstrate understanding of key decisions and to solicit approval of understanding as needed. The specific details for Progress meetings will be included in each Task Order proposal.</p>
<p>(3) Preliminary Lesson Plan (PLP) and Preliminary Reference Manual Outline (PRMO) Walk-through</p>
<p>These are usually two-days in length. During this meeting core players meet to discuss the PLP and PRMO developed by the contractor's team. The Contractor's Instructional Systems Designer shall attend and participate in the portion of the meeting when the PLP is discussed.</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop and submit an electronic draft PLP and PRMO, to the COTR and Technical Review Panel for review and comment, no less than two weeks prior to the walk-though meeting. Within two weeks after the walk-though meeting where comments were provided to the contractor by the Government, the contractor shall incorporate the Government's and panel member's comments, and provide a revised electronic copy of the final PLP and PRMOs (in both MS Word and PDF), including a cover letter, to the COTR. Written approval of the final, accepted, PLP shall be provided by the COTR to the contractor after receipt of an acceptable PLP.</p>
<p>The specific details for the PLP and PRMO walkthrough meetings will be included in the Task Order proposals.</p>
<p>(4) 50% and 100% Walkthroughs are scheduled when 50% of the course content is 100% complete and when 100% of the course content is 100% complete. The 50% walkthrough lasts about 1 day longer than half of the formal course. The 100% walkthrough lasts about 1 day longer than the formal course.</p>
<p>a. The purpose of the walkthroughs is to link course content with the learning outcomes, validate technical course materials; agree on course sequencing; explain any group exercises, case studies, computer applications, field trips or other course content issues; and secure approval to proceed. The Contractor Project Team is responsible for printing, and shipping these materials to the COTR and the Technical Review Team. The specific details for the 50% and 100% walkthrough meetings will be included in Task Order proposals.</p>
<p>(5) Pilot course is scheduled as a "beta test" when the course is 100% complete. The pilot course is presented before a representative NHI audience. The COTR, the NHI Instructional Systems Designer, and the Technical Review Team participate as observers. The course is checked for content validity, length, pacing; delivery techniques are assessed and questions raised by participants are recorded. The COTR and/or a Contractor Project Team representative will facilitate a de-briefing of participants at the end of each day. The contractor shall incorporate any feedback into the final course development.</p>
<p>Course development, update or revision tasks may include, but are not limited to, developing or designing the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Draft Course and Reference Manual Outlines (to be brought to the kickoff)<br />(2) Preliminary Lesson Plans<br />(3) Preliminary Reference Manual Outlines<br />(4) For web-based or web-conference training , High-level and Detailed-level Design Plan, Storyboards, Facilitator Guides<br />(5) Participant Workbooks and Handouts<br />(6) Instructor Guides<br />(7) Reference Manuals<br />(8) Visual Aids<br />(9) Case Studies<br />(10) Computer Applications/Animations<br />(11) Group and Independent Exercises<br />(12) Field Trips<br />(13) End-of-Course Assessments</p>
<p>C.7.4 MEDIA PRODUCTION</p>
<p>The NHI's goal is to optimize the training for maximum effectiveness; ensuring participants have an opportunity for learning within the defined constraints of the designated learning environment. This process involves development of multi-media materials precisely targeted to participant needs and learning styles. To the greatest extend economically feasible, materials should employ state-of-the-art techniques such as 3-D visualizations, animations, simulations, virtual tours, physical models, etc.</p>
<p>Work under this task area may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) Designing, developing, and producing visual messages that can be distributed and accessed via DVD, CD ROM, or mobile devices such as mobile phones, hand-held Personal Data Assistants (PDAs), Net books, and other digital mobile devices designed to access public data networks</p>
<p>C.7.5 COURSE DELIVERY</p>
<p>The NHI courses are generally taught in teams of two instructors, including combinations of contractor instructors and FHWA instructors. There may be times that a local representative is invited as a "guest" speaker to address a particular course topic; this would be specified in the course Instructor Guide. The contractor shall provide only technically knowledgeable instructors-- with skills in adult learning-- to present courses in response to requests from the target audience specified in Section C.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Work under this task area may include, but is not limited to:</p>

<p>g. Arranging for or presenting instructor training to enhance and optimize both the Government and contractor's presenters' skills in the delivery of video-based training delivery.</p>
<p>The contractor shall in all cases, provide skilled, competent, knowledgeable, credible instructors with adult education experience. All instructors assigned should either be currently certified through the NHI Instructor Development or equivalent course, or achieve certification within one year after assignment to a Task Order issued hereunder. The Government reserves the absolute right to provide Government employees as presenters in lieu of the contractor staff. In some instances it may be necessary for the contractor to attend a train-the-trainer session to meld together a team of contractor and FHWA presenters to maximize their effectiveness.</p>
<p>The NHI may, from time to time, during course delivery hold instructor conference calls to discuss processes, problems, outdated material, possible changes, and any other matters considered important to task performance. Offerors who are awarded Task Order for course delivery shall have at least one Project Manager or Instructor in attendance during NHI Instructor conference calls, unless prior notice is given of the upcoming absence, and the contractor receives approval, from the CO or COTR in advance of the conference call. Contractors shall distribute notes on items covered in NHI Instructor conference calls to their entire instructor team.</p>
<p>C.7.6 BRIEFINGS</p>
<p>Briefings to various groups are necessary from time to time to determine training needs, guide the development of curriculum materials, promote and market new products or courses, and gather customer feedback. These briefings may be conducted at the NHI facilities or other locations designated by the Government.</p>
<p>Work under this task area may include, but is not limited to :</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare and present briefings or participate in discussions to determine training needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare and present briefings on NHI products and activities.</p>
<p>C.7.7 CURRICULUM REVISIONS</p>
<p>Comments and recommendations for improvement of the course and/or course material can be expected throughout the life of this contract. It is anticipated that moderate adjustments or revisions of the course material, visual aids, and presentation will be made by the contractor as part of the contractor's normal preparation effort for course delivery at no additional cost to the Government. Examples of such revisions would be comments by participants and new specifications revisions approved by AASHTO. Moderate adjustments or revisions of the course material shall be coordinated with, and approved by the COTR and FHWA Technical lead for the course. When the contractor receives approval of revisions by the Government, the contractor shall prepare a revised 508 compliant version of the course materials which shall be delivered to the COTR within two weeks of receiving the government's approval.</p>
<p>If, more significant revisions become necessary, such as reformatting major sections of the course, updating the material to add significant new technology, adjusting the sequence of presentation, or otherwise improving the curriculum and reference materials associated with this course, the contractor shall submit to the COTR a summary of recommendations for revising the curriculum and/or reference material and a detailed price estimate to complete the recommended work. The Government will review the contractor's recommendations and if acceptable, the Contracting Officer may definitize the authorized work by issuance of a Task Order modification to incorporate the recommendation(s) into the Task Order. The contractor shall not proceed with these revisions without written authorization from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>C.8 SPECIFICATIONS FOR COURSE PRESENTATIONS:</p>
<p>The Host Agency will furnish a training facility large enough to accommodate up to 30 participants (up to 40 participants for selected courses); is responsible for selecting and inviting participants; and providing flip charts, tape, pads, markers screens, audio/visual equipment, and extension cords.</p>
<p>The instructors are responsible for bringing a laptop computer compatible with a multi-media projector (e.g. LCD projector) that supports operation of Microsoft &reg; PowerPoint 2000 or higher software, with compatible resolution; their copy of the Instructor Guide for the course; and any other, course-related materials agreed upon in the Task Order. The laptop computer and multi-media projector shall be capable of projecting images, videos, and other multi-media training materials at a resolution appropriate to the materials, and bright enough to be seen in a training room with some ambient light. The multimedia projectors should have a minimum capacity of 1000 lumens.</p>
<p>The Government, unless otherwise indicated in a task order RFP, is responsible for printing and shipping participant course materials (e.g. Participant Workbook, Reference Manual, etc), NHI Class Roster, NHI Course Registration Forms, NHI Evaluation Forms, three-ring binders, and name tents. These materials are shipped to the Host Coordinator 30 days in advance of the class. The Government is not responsible for making travel arrangements for instructors.</p>
<p>A variety of entities can serve as the "host" for an NHI course. These include: State or local transportation agencies; private sector consultants; associations, industry groups; other Federal agencies, etc.</p>
<p>The host agency will designate a "local coordinator" whose name and phone number will be listed on the NHI website for sessions that have been confirmed. This person is the contact for any logistical information related to the scheduled session (e.g. publicizing the session, course registration, training location, directions, lodging information, etc). As the course registration contact, the Local Coordinator is responsible for selecting and inviting participants and can "sell" slots to others if space is available. Approximately 30 - 40 participants will be invited to attend each course. If the Local Coordinator requests additional slots, and if the local Coordinator guarantees that the training room will be large enough to comfortably accommodate up to 5 additional slots, the decision will be made by the COTR in concert with the session instructors to increase the class size by up to an additional 5 participants.</p>
<p>The Local Coordinator will provide a training facility that meets the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements, audio visual equipment, flip chart paper and stands, markers, etc. Most Local Coordinators arrange for morning and afternoon refreshments and provide information on nearby lunch options. Local Coordinators are also responsible for completing the NHI Certificates of Training. Additional information on Local Coordinator responsibilities is available in the Registration and Coordination section of the NHI catalogue, available on-line at: www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov. <br />For each course delivery the contractor shall:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Establish contact with the host coordinator at least 30 days prior to the course starting date to discuss classroom needs (e.g. size of the room, arrangement of tables and chairs, audio visual equipment, etc). This includes, but is not limited to, adjusting the class hours to match local work hours or preferences, and adjusting the presentation to allow increased or decreased emphasis on certain topics to accommodate local concerns or problems of interest to host agency personnel.</p>
<p>&bull; If appropriate, identify a course-related Subject Matter Expert (SME) at the host location at least 14 days in advance of the class (e.g. subject matter experts from FHWA Division offices, state or local highway agencies, etc) to discuss a scheduled course. The purpose of this discussion is to make the course more meaningful to participants by identifying local issues or hot topics that may be relevant to the presentation; referencing local policies; providing local examples to support course content; or arranging for a local speaker, if appropriate.</p>
<p>&bull; For courses with field trips, instructors shall interact with students during field trips, prepare photos of the field trip bridges and develop sample sketches of areas of field trip bridges and use them in presentations to the participants in their pre-and post-field trip presentations.</p>
<p>&bull; Transport all training aids to the course location. This includes all items to be used by the instructors, such as PowerPoint slides, pre-printed flip charts, videos, handouts, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide and transport to the course location a suitable laptop computer, presentation software (e.g. PowerPoint) and a multi-media projector with a minimum of 1,000 lumens.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare a daily schedule for each course and furnish a copy to each participant.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that all participants sign the NHI Class Roster, listing their name, title and employer. The Instructor is to fill in all information requested on the front page of the roster, including course number, title, and dates of presentation, instructor names and the Summary of Participants section. Provide the completed roster to the COTR within one (1) week after each course is complete. Since NHI invoices are generated from the Class Roster, this is an important requirement.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that all participants complete the NHI Course Registration Form, with all fields completed and corresponding "bubbles" filled in. In addition to providing input to NHI's database, this form also serves as the means of recording Continuing Education Credits (CEU's) for class participants.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure that all participants complete the NHI Evaluation Form, with all fields completed and corresponding "bubbles" filled in. Instructor should bring their instructor number to courses, making sure to request an instructor number from NHI prior to the session if they do not already have one. The instructor shall provide copies of evaluation forms to both the COTR and Host Coordinator within two weeks after the course session, and also provide a summary of course evaluation scores and comments to the COTR within two weeks after the course session ends.</p>
<p>Record comments and recommendations for course improvement from participants, course monitors, co-instructors, observers and others and provide a summary to the COTR, as needed. This feedback will be used to determine if minor updates are required or a more extensive course revision is necessary.</p>
<p>&bull; Make note of minor adjustments or updates of course materials, visual aids, etc. Examples include, but are not limited to, updating charts, tables, data, etc; replacing out-of-date photos; updating laws, regulations, policies, guidance, et cetera. Discuss these minor adjustments or updates with the COTR and proceed following approval. Include a summary of minor adjustments or updates to course materials in monthly progress reports, as well as through direct communication with the COTR.</p>
<p>&bull; Administer and proctor the End of Course Assessment when applicable. Should the selected tool be an objective test, participants not desiring CEUs may be excused. However, all participants should be encouraged to fully participate in the Assessment since it will reinforce the learning outcomes and ensure the Instructors have been successful in teaching the course material. Upon completion of the allotted time period, the Assessment tool shall be collected to maintain security. The participant answer sheets for objective assessment shall also be collected and scored by the instructors after the session has been completed. Participants achieving a score of 70 percent or higher will be eligible for the award of CEUs, provided they have attended 100 percent of the course. For bridge inspection courses: Instructors are required to score the assessment while the content of the assessment is reviewed, after the exams are collected. NHI Attendance Certificates shall only be provided to participants who passed the assessment. For participants who score below a 70%, in lieu of an attendance certificate, instructors shall issue a letter informing students they did not pass the course and encourage them to retake the course. A sample "No Pass" letter will be provided to contractors delivering bridge inspection courses.</p>
<p>&bull; Verify that all participants engaged in a case study understand and use the outcomes to achieve application level learning, attended 100 percent of the course and will therefore receive CEUs. Record the participant scores on the Session Roster form and provide one copy of the End of Course Assessment results to the COTR and to the host agency within two weeks after each course ends.</p>
<p>For each synchronous Web-based presentation (Web-Conference Training), the contractor shall, as a minimum:</p>
<p>&bull; Log in at least 5 days in advance of the scheduled session start time to ensure that the training room is properly set up, links to external information and resources are functional, the presenter and host are confident that all pods are built and populated and become familiar with general use of the learning environment. <br />&bull; Ensure that each presenter has registered on the NHI Web site as an instructor; has indicated which courses they are under contract to instruct; has input their biography (not to exceed 2000 characters); and, has received a 4-digit NHI Instructor Code. Questions about the procedure may be directed to the NHI Instructor Liaison. <br />&bull; Discuss local conditions with the Local Coordinator and adjust the class hours to match local work hours or time zones as requested by the sponsoring agency.<br />&bull; Prepare a session agenda and one-page biography for each contract instructor and furnish copies to the Local Coordinator in advance of the session presentation.<br />&bull; Contact the appropriate Subject Matter Expert (e.g. FHWA division office rep, environmental agency rep, MPO staff, etc) at the session location and discuss local concerns, hot issues, or topics that would be relevant to those attending. <br />&bull; Adjust the presentation to allow increased/decreased emphasis on certain modules to accommodate the training needs of session participants. <br />&bull; A week before the start of the NHI session, visit the NHI Web site located at http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/, and check the Resources Page for delivery contractor/instructor resources and updates.<br />&bull; Log in at least 30 minutes in advance of the scheduled session start time to ensure that the training room is properly set up for the session and the Web-conference session dial-in number is posted. <br />&bull; Encourage all participants to complete the End-of-Course Assessment. <br />&bull; Encourage all participants to complete the NHI Course Evaluation form via the online link.<br />&bull; During the instruction of sessions, provide information to participants about other NHI courses that may aid their professional development. (A complete list of the NHI course listings can be found at http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/.)<br />&bull; Provide a written assessment report including, but not limited to the number of registered participants, the number of participants that completed the course, the length of time participants took in each asynchronous module, the length of each synchronous module, the average test scores of participants, any recommendations on which participants should not be awarded CEUs based upon insufficient participation, significant comments, and any recommendations for adjustments to the course materials within 2 weeks of the last synchronous meeting.</p>

<p>All publications funded by FHWA must show the proper departmental "mark and signature" on the front cover, title page, and (space permitting) the spine. Internet documents must show the mark and signature at the beginning of the document or on the document's "cover" page.</p>
<p>The full "mark and signature" must be used, which includes the DOT mark (the triskelion), the Department's name, and the Administration's name. The Administration's name must appear in bold typeface. The logo may be reproduced in any color that is appropriate to the color themes of the publication, as long as the elements of the color used allow for sufficient contrast to read and understand the sign and accompanying text. The "same color is used for the entire "mark and signature (logo), including the DOT/FHWA names. The only exception to the one-color rule is the use of DOT blue (Pantone 285) for the triskelion, and black for the text. No other two-color combinations can be used. The logo may not be rearranged, altered, added to, or edited.</p>
<p>If the publication is a jointly prepared document, the FHWA logo must appear if FHWA has contributed to the publication. Logos from other DOT modes or Federal agencies may appear along with the FHWA logo on jointly prepared publications. If another agency is a co-author, then that agency's seal or logo should appear to the right or directly below the FHWA logo.</p>
<p>Original publication must adhere to generally accepted "Standard Printing Practices" acknowledged by the printing industry.</p>
<p>FHWA as a government agency uses the Microsoft Operating System (OS). Other operating systems, including Macintosh/Apple are not acceptable as final deliverables.

<p>All funds expended under this contract shall be incurred, accounted for, and invoiced under individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to provide all contractors awarded a contract under this solicitation a fair opportunity to be considered for each proposed Task Order in the topic awarded. The Government expects to issue a solicitation for a Task Order proposal to all eligible contractors asking for a technical proposal and pricing information. However, the Government may issue Task Orders on a non-competitive basis or limited competitive basis as may be appropriate and authorized by regulation.

Task Order solicitations will specify the evaluation criteria that will be utilized together with a statement of the relative importance of each criterion. In accordance with FAR 16.505 (a) (9) (i), the selection of a contractor to perform a Task Order is not subject to protest, except in limited circumstances. Each Task Order will provide specific information on the work to be performed, the objectives or results desired, a period of performance, deliverables, pricing and other terms specific to the individual Task Order.</p>
<p>The work shall be conducted by the contractor on an as needed basis, within the scope of the contract. The exact nature and extent of the contractor's work under this contract will be based upon written Task Order Proposal Request (TOPR) developed by the Government, once work is identified.

<p>The Contracting Officer may enter into negotiations with those contractors submitting a TOP, and may request a revised TOP, as the situation may warrant.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each TOP in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria, and will award the Task Order to the contractor who offers the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Upon mutual agreement of the parties as to the work to be performed, the schedule, and the pricing, the FHWA will issue a Task Order. The contractor shall acknowledge acceptance of the Task Order and shall immediately proceed with the conduct of the work.</p>

Accordingly, in accordance with FAR 16.505 (b) (5), an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of contractor's concerns resulting from task order award. The existence of the ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with the ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for resolution.</p>
<p>If the Contracting Officer cannot make resolution, interested parties may contact the FHWA ombudsman, Ms. Patricia Prosperi, at the following address:</p>
<p>Ms. Patricia A. Prosperi<br />Associate Administrator for Administration/Agency Competition Advocate<br />HAD-1<br />1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE<br />Washington, DC 20590<br />E-mail: administration.fhwa@dot.gov</p>

<p>If the contractor purchases non-refundable tickets as a cost saving measure, and then is required to change or cancel the tickets due to causes beyond their control, the contractor may claim reimbursement for service charges. Unused tickets paid for by the Government must be sent promptly to the Contracting Officer, unless it is likely they can be reissued for a later trip and the company maintains an adequate accounting system to protect the tickets from misuse, and insures the Government will not be billed for the subsequent trip. Complete justification and accounting must be provided with the invoice.</p>
<p>Saturday night stay over are not required to take advantage of lower fares, but if the traveler chooses to stay over, the Government may reimburse the contractor for the additional lodging and per diem expenses, if the reduced cost of the airline ticket offsets these expenses. Complete justification and accounting must be provided with the invoice, to include a comparison of actual costs with and without the additional travel day.</p>
<p>Requests for use of a rental car shall always be justified, in advance of travel. Rental car use is to be the exception rather than the rule.

The COTR is NOT authorized to change the statement of work, to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, delivery schedule, period of performance or other terms or conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit or obligate the Government for the expenditure of public funds, award, modify or terminate a contract or Task Order. The technical administration of this contract shall not be construed to authorize the revision of the terms and conditions of this contract.</p>
<p>If the contractor receives direction from anyone other than the Contracting Officer it believes will affect the terms, conditions, schedule or pricing, it shall not proceed with such direction. The contractor shall discuss its reservations with the COTR and the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will provide resolution.</p>

<p><br />SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>H.1 NONPERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT</p>
<p>This contract is a "nonpersonal services contract" as defined FAR Section 37.101. It is understood and agreed that the contractor and its employees, consultants and subcontractors:</p>
<p>1. Shall perform the services specified herein as independent contractors, not as<br />employees of the Government; <br />2. Shall be responsible for their own management and administration of the work <br />Required, and bear sole responsibility for complying with all technical, schedule, or financial requirements or constraints attendant to the performance of this contract;<br />3. Shall be free from any direct or indirect supervision or control by any government<br />employee.<br />4. Shall, pursuant to the government rights under contract clauses such as "Inspection," and "Key Personnel" comply with such general direction of authorized Government employees as is necessary and appropriate to ensure accomplishment of the contract requirements and objectives.</p>
<p>H.2 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY</p>
<p>Any Government Furnished Property provided for the performance of this contact shall be accounted for as provided in Transportation Acquisition Regulation Subpart 1245.5.</p>
<p>H.3 ACCESS TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION BY CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information , which shall not be disclosed by the contractor unless authorized by the contracting officer. To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual's suitability to have such authorization. The contractor employees found by the Government to be unsuitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security, may be prevented from performing work under the particular contract when requested by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that contractor employees are: (1) citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by immigration status) as evidenced by Immigration and Naturalization Service documentation; and (2) have background investigations in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management.</p>
<p>The contractor's employees may be required to sign the Confidentiality Statement.</p>
<p>The contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive information, and/or resources.</p>
<p>H.4 PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AND LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING</p>
<p>a. It is anticipated that in performance of this contract, the contractor may require access to, or receipt of, information and data relating to FHWA's plans, programs, technical requirements, and budgetary matters, and such other information, the disclosure of which may give competitive advantage to recipients or would be adverse to the interests of the Government.</p>
<p>b. The contractor shall not disclose such information acquired to anyone, other than those contractor, subcontractor, or consultant personnel performing work under this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer, until such time as the Government may have authorized the release of such information and data to the public.</p>
<p>c. To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, the contractor shall protect such data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use it to compete against such companies.</p>
<p>d. It is anticipated that during performance of this contract, the contractor may be issued Task Orders involving technical evaluations of other contractor's offers or products. FAR 9.505-3 provides that contracts shall not generally be awarded to a contractor that would evaluate, or advise the Government concerning, its own products or activities, or those of a competitor, without proper safeguards to ensure objectivity and protect the Government's interest. These safeguards will be accomplished by restricting future contracting with the Government, as delineated below.</p>
<p>e. FHWA will not unilaterally disclose to the contractor any proprietary information furnished by domestic or foreign participants in FHWA's programs. If the contractor requires access to such information in performance of this contract, an agreement concerning release and restrictions on the use of such data must be sought by the contractor with the source of the data.</p>
<p>f. It is required by the parties of this contract, that the contractor will be restricted in its future contracting with the Government, for any service or product which may encompass information acquired under items a and c above that is not publicly available and could give a competitive advantage to the contractor or would be adverse to the interests of the Government. Accordingly, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform as a prime contractor, subcontractor or consultant, or in any capacity to any supplier under an ensuring Government contract. Any questions on this matter shall be immediately addressed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>g. These restrictions do not limit the contractor's right to use and disclose any information and data obtained from another source without restriction.</p>
<p>h. The contractor agrees to train its employees who will have access to such sensitive information in all necessary security procedures and required them to sign non-disclosure statements and certificates attesting to their understanding of the requirements for safeguarding such information.</p>
<p>i. In the event that the contractor fails to comply with this provision of the contract, the Government may terminate the contract for default.</p>
<p>j. The contractor shall include this provision, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts and consultant agreements for performance of work under this contract unless excused in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>

FRAUDULENT LETTERS</p>
<p>*****ALERT**** FRAUDULENT CCR LETTERS***********</p>
<p>Recently, U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) contractors and potential contractors have received fraudulent letters purporting to be issued by DOT. Often the letters have been signed by "John Duncan, Senior Procurement Officer". These fraudulent letters request that current or potential contractors resubmit their Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) banking information to DOT. If you receive such a letter, please DO NOT complete the requested CCR worksheet that is attached to the letters and DO NOT release any information to the facsimile number cited in the letter. Please be aware that no Federal agency requires any confidential information to be submitted to verify CCR registration. The CCR is a legitimate government system. However, to register, contractors should go directly through the CCR website and never through a third party. There is no requirement to send information directly to any Federal agency. For information on how to register in the CCR, please visit website http://www.ccr.gov/.</p>
<p>The point of contact concerning these fraudulent letters is the DOT Office of the Inspector General. You should call their hotline at 1-800-424-9071.</p>

<p>Company, University, or Transportation Center descriptive brochures may be included and are not part of the page limitations. You may wish to refer us to a company/organization website for additional information rather than take up pages unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Present your proposal in a logical manner readily tied to the requirements herein. Each topic area is to be treated separately as they will be evaluated individually. Identify and explain any exceptions you are taking to the proposed contract requirements.</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify those who they intend to utilize in key positions in performance of any Task Orders issued. These include staff, consultants, or subcontractors. Resumes of all proposed key personnel are required, and may not exceed 3 pages for each person proposed.

The letter must cite this solicitation number. These same requirements apply when proposing key personnel for a Task Order, with the letter citing the proposed Task Order number. A resume alone does not meet this requirement.</p>
<p>Describe your organization's technical capabilities to perform the kinds of work described under each topic area for which you wish to be awarded a contract. Clarity and completeness are of the utmost importance in the proposal. With the exceptions of the responsibility determination and the past performance evaluations, only material contained within the proposal will be considered in the source evaluation and selection process.

<p>*****ALERT**** FRAUDULENT CCR LETTERS***********<br />Recently, current U. S.

These fraudulent letters request that current or potential Contractors register in the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR). If you receive such a letter, please DO NOT complete the requested CCR worksheet that is attached to the letters and DO NOT release any information to the facsimile number cited in the letter. Please be aware that no Federal agency requires any confidential information to be submitted to verify CCR registration. The CCR is a legitimate government system. However, to register, Contractors should go directly through the CCR website and never through a third party. There is no requirement to send information directly to any Federal agency. For information on how to register in the CCR, please visit website http://www.ccr.gov/ or call 1-888-227-2423.</p>

<p>&bull; The offeror's proposed staff member's qualifications and experience in accordance with the Selection Factors as set forth below in Section M of this Solicitation <br />&bull; The offer's understanding of and approach to technical services support in accordance with the Selection Factor as set forth below in Section M of this Solicitation <br />&bull; The offeror's ability to provide technical assistance in the required technical, functional, and situational competencies in accordance with the Selection Factor as set forth below in Section M of this Solicitation</p>
<p>The Government will combine the results of the initial evaluations performed under M.2 to arrive at an overall evaluation for each offeror. The Government will next examine each offeror's price in accordance with Selection Factor 4 as set forth in Section M of this solicitation. The Government will then establish a competitive range.</p>
<p>(Optional: The Government Reserves the Right to Award a Contract Without Discussions): The Government reserves the right to award the contract(s), without discussion, to the most competitive offeror(s). It is therefore imperative that each offeror's initially-submitted written proposal present the offeror's best terms and be thoroughly documented.</p>
<p>If and only if the Government decides to hold discussions, then the Government may invite the offerors within the competitive range to negotiations/discussions.</p>

<p>Note: It is requested (but it is not required) that all binding be in the form of a plastic spiral binder at the left margin. Do not use paper clips or staples as binding.</p>
<p>Volume I - Font, graphic, page, and formatting specifications</p>
<p>Each double-sided page shall count as two pages for purposes of the page limitations noted above and in this paragraph. The Past Performance Questionnaires should not be included inside Volume I, and will not count in the page count. Except as stated below in this paragraph, Volume I shall be presented in 12 point font or larger. Subject to the exception stated in the next sentence, the dimensions of each page in Volume I shall be no greater than 8 &frac12; inches by 14 inches. Up to 20 of the 150 maximum pages in Volume I may be "fold-out" pages having dimensions not exceeding 8 &frac12; inches by 14 inches ----provided that any such fold-out pages are bound into Volume I and are folded down to a size not exceeding 8 &frac12; inches by 14 inches. Footnotes, legends, or labels associated with tables or diagrams, and other information which is ancillary to the main text, may be presented in a font size smaller than twelve point font---provided that any such smaller font is fully legible. Resumes are not considered ancillary material, and must therefore be presented in 12 point font or larger. Resumes may not be presented on fold-out pages. If, in order to place its entire Master Staffing Table on just one page (probably a fold-out page) an offeror needs to use a font size smaller than 12 point, then the offeror may do so, provided that the font size used on the Master Staffing Table is fully legible.</p>
<p>Experience descriptions and completed Past Performance Questionnaires shall be provided only for work that was performed in a significant way by key personnel who are being proposed to SERVE on this particular contract. Names and the Roles of those being proposed to serve on this particular project shall be identified on each experience description and on each Past Performance Questionnaire submitted in the proposal. The role of the person who worked on the Past Performance shall be clearly indicated in the write-up.</p>
<p>VOLUME I - RELEVANT TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>PART I - Staffing</p>
<p>A. Provide a Table of Key Personnel and Their Other Commitments <br />Provide resumes and a table showing the names of all proposed Key Personnel. For purposes of constructing that required table, the term "Key Personnel" shall include the:</p>
<p>&bull; Principal Investigator <br />&bull; Project Manager <br />&bull; Instructors<br />&bull; Instructional Systems Designer (for development teams)</p>
<p>For each such individual, show the following, in that table: the name of the individual's employer; the position that the individual is proposed to occupy on this particular project; the project name and the contract number of every other project (Federal and non-Federal) on which the individual is currently committed to serve at any time during the period beginning on July 23, 2011 and ending on February 22, 2016; and, the number of hours that the individual is estimated to serve on each such "other project" in each year of that period. For purposes of this required table, an individual is "committed" to serve on only those "other projects" for which there is already in existence a signed contract, a signed task order, or some other mutually-binding written agreement. In other words, this table need not show "other projects" that are merely in the bidding phase and are not yet awarded.</p>
<p>B. Provide Resumes for Other than Key Personnel</p>
<p>Resumes shall be submitted for each of the remaining proposed labor category as identified in except that no resume is required for any administrative support personnel.</p>
<p>Each resume shall clearly identify and describe the individual's related project experience and education as it relates to the performance of this contract and the position descriptions. The firm that the personnel work for should also be clearly identified.</p>
<p>C. Provide a Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix</p>
<p>Each offeror shall provide a Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix that crosswalk the personnel listed in the resumes to the competencies areas and tasks.</p>
<p>The Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix must be a comprehensive one which covers not only the prime offeror's proposed internal staffing, but also the staffing proposed for each separate subcontractor and consultant. Resumes must support the ratings given in this matrix so that the ratings are substantiated and validated.</p>
<p>It is requested----but it is not required----that the entire Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix be presented on just one page. Recall that under the circumstances specified above in "Page and Size Limits for Volume I", an offeror might qualify for using, in the Master Staffing Capabilities Matrix, a font size smaller than 12-point.</p>
<p>Labor Categories<br /><br />The following skills/disciplines and/or expertise are believed to be necessary for the successful completion, of all topic areas, of the contract, although every discipline may not be applicable to each and every task order, and the offeror is free to utilize any discipline it chooses to successfully perform the contract.</p>
<p>Labor Categories<br />1) Senior subject matter expert (bridge design, bridge inspection, geotechnical engineering and hydraulics engineering) <br />2) Mid-level subject matter expert (bridge design, bridge inspection, geotechnical engineering and hydraulics engineering) <br />3) Junior-level subject matter expert (bridge design, bridge inspection, geotechnical engineering and hydraulics engineering)<br />4) Senior Program Manager/Principal Investigator<br />5) Mid-level Program Manager/Principal Investigator<br />6) Senior Bridge Design/Bridge Inspection/Geotechnical/Hydraulics Instructor<br />7) Mid-Level Bridge Design/Bridge Inspection/Geotechnical/Hydraulics Instructor<br />8) Junior Bridge Design/Bridge Inspection/Geotechnical/Hydraulics Instructor<br />9) Senior-level Instructional Systems Designer<br />10) Mid-level Instructional Systems Designer<br />11) Junior-level Instructional Systems Designer<br />12) Administrative Support personnel<br />13) Senior-level 2D and 3D Modelers and Animators<br />14) Mid-level 2D and 3D Modelers and Animators<br />15) Junior-level 2D and 3D Modelers and Animators<br />16) Senior-level (Graphic Artist, Web Developer, Writer/Editor, Programmer, Research/Technical Writer)<br />17) Mid-level (Graphic Artist, Web Developer, Writer/Editor, Programmer, Research/Technical Writer)<br />18) Junior-level (Graphic Artist, Web Developer, Writer/Editor, Programmer, Research/Technical Writer)</p>
<p>PART II - Approach to the Work Program</p>
<p>Section C of the RFP includes a Statement of Work for the program. The purpose of this part of the offeror's response is to present the knowledge, understanding, and approach to addressing the work tasks that are anticipated. This response is not meant to regurgitate the Section C requirements, but to talk about the understanding of the issues involved, the approach to addressing such issues, and the unique experience of the offerors team to address such considerations. Due to the number of tasks and the page limitations, this will require the offeror to be concise and succinct.</p>
<p>PART III - 5 Sealed Past Performance Questionnaires (in Original Proposal only)</p>
<p>Each offeror's initially-submitted written proposal shall include no more than ten Past Performance Questionnaires completed by organizations for whom the offeror has performed or is performing work. The requirements (and the exceptions) as to the relevancy of the projects to be cited in those five Past Performance Questionnaires are the same as are given above for the Contract/Subcontract Experience Descriptions. Each prime offeror should attempt to include----within the five completed Past Performance Questionnaires----one Questionnaire describing work performed by each separate proposed major subcontractors on the Offerors team.</p>
<p>IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL FIVE OF THE COMPLETED PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES ARRIVE IN THE FHWA'S OFFICE OF ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT IN THE VERY SAME OUTER BOX OR OUTER CONTAINER THAT ALSO ENCLOSES THE OTHER PORTIONS OF THE OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL. IN OTHER WORDS, THE PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES CANNOT BE SUBMITTED SEPARATELY FROM THE OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>Each separate Past Performance Questionnaire should be sealed by the customer who completed it, and must then be forwarded by that customer to the offeror, for inclusion in the offeror's proposal. <br />In the original of the Volume II proposal, include a minimum of five completed Past Performance Questionnaires by the Offeror's customers <br /><br />1. The completed questionnaires must be submitted by current (within the last three years) customers (both commercial and Government) involving similar or related services.</p>
<p>2. The completed questionnaires shall be from independent sources.</p>
<p>3. Offerors must submit each completed customer questionnaire in a separate envelope that has been sealed by the customer for confidentiality.</p>
<p>4. The Government may contact the customer point of contact (POC) for verification. POC telephone and facsimile numbers must be accurate and current.</p>
<p>5. Failure to provide complete information regarding previous similar and/or related contracts may result in eventual disqualification. The CO will consider such performance information along with other factors in determining whether the Offeror is to be considered responsible, as defined in FAR 9.101. The Offeror is responsible for ensuring the questionnaires are completed in a timely manner and are submitted with its proposal.</p>
<p>NOTE: In evaluating an offeror's past performance, the FHWA reserves: (a) the right to look beyond the Past Performance Questionnaires submitted by the offeror, and the right to perform its own research into the offeror's past performance; and (b) the right to take into account any other information (not provided by the offeror) which the U. S. Department of Transportation possesses regarding the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Past Performance Questionnaire Projects May Overlap with Projects Cited In Contract/Subcontract Experience Descriptions</p>
<p>There is no requirement that the projects cited in an offeror's Past Performance Questionnaires be different from the projects cited in the offeror's Contract/Subcontract Experience Descriptions. An overlap is permissible.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - Cost/Price Information</p>
<p>This volume shall include all pricing information and certain general financial/organizational information, as described below:</p>
<p><br />PART I - Cost/Price Information</p>
<p>1. The cost/price information is meant to determine an overall cost contract by the offerors team, as well as understand the details and assumptions that are included in the offeror's price for services. The man-hours for all labor categories and basic Other Direct Costs (ODC's) (See L.17 Below) that are anticipated have been estimated by the Government and are provided below (L.18 Estimated Level of Effort) for all, offerors as an input to the cost/price information preparation. It is recommended that the Estimates are used in completing the cost and price information and the calculations are clearly indicated herein. All offerors shall submit:</p>
<p>a. Direct Labor Breakdown - Provide the costs for personnel, by labor category, that are anticipated over the five years of the contract period of performance. As a part of the Excel spreadsheet (Attachment E), the annual increases in labor cost escalation should also be inputted by the offeror to reflect anticipated changes in labor costs over the five year period.</p>
<p>b. Other Direct Costs - Base year other direct costs (ODC's) are estimated by the Government and are included below in section L.18. As a part of the Excel spreadsheet, the annual increases in travel, equipment/materials, and other additional costs escalation should also be inputted by the offeror to reflect anticipated changes in ODCs over the five year period.</p>
<p>The offeror may provide comments on ODC costs that they feel should be added, or deleted, due to their cost structure or assumptions. They may be addressed if they are short listed or selected for contract negotiations with the Government.</p>
<p>c. Start-up Activities - For the first-year budget summary for Competency Area/Task 4.2.2 Start-Up Activities, a subsidiary budget summary showing only, and all of, the offeror's proposed costs and fee for any "Start-Up Task Order" desired by the offeror; or, as an alternative to submitting that subsidiary budget summary for the Competency Area/Task 4.2.2 Start-Up Activities, submit a certification that the offeror is not requesting a Start-Up Task Order and that the offeror will recover start-up costs, if at all, only through the application of the offeror's approved indirect cost rates</p>
<p>d. Assumptions Made in Estimating Costs - For each of the above cost items, the offeror shall clearly indicate any assumptions and conditions that have been made in estimating costs. These will be important to both evaluating costs as well as may be discussed in future contract negotiations if short listing or contract negotiations are initiated.</p>
<p>e. A separate budget summary showing the total proposed price for each separate year of the project; thus each offeror shall submit five of those yearly budget summaries.</p>
<p>Budget summaries shall clearly identify the following information and utilize the following criteria as applicable:</p>
<p>a. loaded labor by labor categories and by named individual, to include hours, un-loaded hourly pay rates, and pay escalations. These data shall be provided for the prime offeror and for all proposed subcontractors and affiliates.</p>
<p>b. Other direct costs and travel costs (see sub-paragraphs b above) need not be itemized----except that any ODCs and any travel costs proposed for any Start-Up Task Order under Task A should be itemized.</p>
<p>c. Any cost data or cost break-out which positively cannot be fitted and displayed on the applicable DOT Form 4220.44 may be shown on a separate attachment page or pages, to be included in the offeror's cost proposal. It is requested that any such attachment pages be presented immediately below the particular DOT Form 4220.44 to which they apply.</p>
<p>The information described in paragraphs above is necessary to determine the adequacy of the offeror's proposal; to validate that the proposed costs are consistent with the technical proposal; and, to help identify unrealistically priced proposals.</p>
<p>1. Any information submitted must support the price proposed. Include sufficient detail or cross-references to clearly establish the relationship of the information provided to the price proposed. Support any information provided by explanations or supporting rationale as needed to permit the Government to evaluate the documentation. Such information is not considered cost or pricing data, and will not require certification in accordance with FAR 15.804-4.</p>
<p>2. NOTE: Each offeror must either: (a) add applicable indirect costs onto the un-loaded travel costs and onto the un-loaded Other Direct Costs prescribed above; or (b) explicitly confirm that the offeror, if awarded the contract, will never apply any indirect rates to un-loaded travel costs nor to un-loaded Other Direct Costs incurred under any resulting contract.</p>
<p>3. Facilities and Special Equipment, Including Tooling: It is the general policy of the FHWA not to provide general or special purpose equipment, facilities or tooling of a capital nature except in unusual circumstances. Items having a unit cost of less than $1,000 will not be provided to the contractor except as authorized with nonprofit institutions or State and local governments. If special purpose equipment of a capital nature is being proposed, provide a description of the items, details of the proposed cost including competitive prices, and a justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.</p>
<p>4. Your proposal must include a statement regarding availability of facilities and equipment necessary to accomplish the required work. If any or all of the required facilities are Government owned, a complete listing of these facilities is required and name of the cognizant Government agency furnishing the facilities and the facilities contract number(s).</p>
<p>PART II - Subcontracts/ Consultants:</p>
<p>If subcontractors and/or individual consultants will be used in carrying out the requirements of this project, the following minimum information concerning the subcontractor shall be furnished:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the subcontractor or consultant.</p>
<p>b. Statement of work and work plan (schedule) for the portion of work to be conducted by the subcontractor or consultant.</p>
<p>c. Names and positions of personnel who will work on the project.</p>
<p>d. A letter or other statement from each proposed consultant and/or subcontractor indicating that he has been approached on the matter of participation in this contract/task order and that he is willing and able to do so in the terms indicated.</p>
<p>e. A cost and price analysis of each Subcontractor/ Consultant proposal, as required under FAR 15.404-3 and in accordance with FAR 52.244-1(b)(7). In addition, show each proposed subcontractor's pricing on separate Contract Pricing Summary forms (DOT Form 4220.44, see Attachment F to this RFP), or show each sub's pricing on equivalent spreadsheets; and, in either case, be sure to show each subcontractor's pricing elements in the same level of analytical detail as is required for the prime offeror's internal pricing. And show each proposed independent consultant's pricing on separate Contract Pricing Summary Forms (or on equivalent spreadsheets), down to the level of the consultant's proposed numbers of staffing hours and the consultant's proposed (unloaded and loaded) hourly consulting pay rate(s) for those proposed hours.</p>
<p>Subcontracting Plan Master Subcontracting Plan (In Volume I Proposal):</p>
<p>Each prime offeror shall include within its Volume I proposal a complete copy of the prime offeror's Master Subcontracting Plan, satisfactorily addressing all of the administrative requirements set forth in FAR section 52.219-9.</p>
<p>Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan (In Volume I Proposal): As prescribed in FAR 52.219-9, if the total contract price is expected to exceed $550,000, the offeror shall include a statement in its offer relative to subcontracting opportunities under the proposed contract. The offeror shall state that there will be subcontracting, or that the offeror has determined that all work will be done in-house. If there will be subcontracting opportunities under this particular project, then the offeror shall submit a Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan pursuant to FAR 52.219-9. If it is determined there will be no subcontracting opportunities under this particular project, then the offeror shall submit a statement of circumstances supporting that determination. All Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plans and all statements supporting the absence of subcontracting opportunities must be acceptable to the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate an acceptable Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan or a statement supporting the absence of subcontracting opportunities shall render the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.</p>
<p>The Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan must provide breakouts of percentages and dollar values associated with small businesses, disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), historically underutilized small businesses (HUBZone), service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), and minority institutions of higher education (MIHE) as compared to the total amount bid for this effort. The Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan shall be included in the offeror's Volume I proposal.</p>
<p>Note: The FHWA does not have pre-set subcontracting goals. Each proposal is evaluated on a case-by-case basis based upon potential availability of qualified small business concerns. However, offerors should be aware of subcontracting goals legislated under 15 U.S.C. 644(g) that prescribes goals of 3% for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), 5% for Small Disadvantaged Business concerns (SDB), and 5% for Women-Owned Small Business concerns (W)SB). The extent, to which subcontracting opportunities are available to these concerns, as well as other non-minority owned small businesses (SB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and other minority institutions of higher education, will be considered in the ultimate award decision.</p>
<p>Note: The participation of small businesses, disadvantaged business enterprise firms (DBE), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), historically underutilized small businesses (HUBZone), service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), and minority institutions of higher education (MIHE) is encouraged. Both the Master Subcontracting Plan and the Procurement-Specific Subcontracting Plan will be considered in the ultimate award decision. See Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>Part III - Other Financial / Organizational Information</p>
<p>Provide the following information:</p>
<p>a. Indicate your fiscal year period (provide month to month dates).</p>
<p>b. Indicate whether the proposed indirect cost rate(s) have been audited and accepted by any Federal audit agency. Give name, location, and telephone number of the agency, and the date of acceptance. If no Federal audit has taken place, data supporting the proposed rates over the past three years must accompany the cost proposal. The data shall include a breakdown of the items comprising overhead and G&amp;A, and the base upon which the burdens are computed.</p>
<p>c. Attach a current financial statement, including a balance sheet and income statement for the last completed fiscal year. Specify resources available to perform the contract without assistance from any other source. If sufficient funds are not available, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source (i.e., bank loans, letter or lines of credit, etc.).</p>
<p>d. Standard Form LLL - Submit a completed Standard Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.</p>
<p>e. Terminated Contracts - List any contract that was terminated for convenience of the Government within the past 3 years, and any contract that was terminated for default within the past 5 years. Briefly explain the circumstances in each instance.</p>
<p>Estimated Other Direct Costs &amp; Travel:</p>
<p>Offerors should use the estimated figures below when preparing their proposal:</p>
<p>L.16 COMMUNICATIONS PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>Offerors shall direct all communications to the attention of the Contracting Officer cited on the face page of this RFP. Communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition, and result in the disqualification of the offeror and/or cancellation of the solicitation.</p>
<p>There are frequently issues that require contact with the offeror. Thus, it is important that you provide a point of contact (POC) together with their e-mail address in your proposal. More than one may be provided.</p>

<p>SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>M.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers and make a best value award decision based on the following factors listed in order of descending importance: (1) Staffing; (2) Technical Approach; (3) Past Performance; and (4) Price. The method of evaluation for each of these factors is described below. The ultimate award decision will be made based on a determination of overall best value, each of the three factors considered.</p>
<p>Rating Methods for all Phases: Proposals will be numerically scored on Selection Factors Technical Approach and Staffing. The Past Performance will not be numerically scored, and will be evaluated as in section 3.1 below. Price will be evaluated for cost reasonableness and realism in accordance with FAR 15.404. Cost will not be numerically scored. Note that the Government reserves the right to revise the initial rating or to revise the initial numerical score given to any offeror on any Selection Factor or sub-factor, if, in the Government's judgment, such a revision is warranted by any relevant information that comes to the Government's attention in any Final Proposal Revision that the Government might request or through clarifications.</p>
<p>M.2 EVALUATION FACTORS:<br />1. Staffing<br />a. Proposed management; demonstrated ability to coordinate a team effort and produce quality timely results; ability of the Contractor to provide effective project management and client service.</p>
<p>b. Academic credentials, spectrum of professional experience and technical competence of the proposed staff to develop effective curriculum materials and apply adult learning instructional design techniques for a training audience of practicing highway engineers and technicians in the subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, Geotechnical). How will the contractor cover the three areas covered by the contract (Separate groups, teaming, staff, subcontractors, consultants)? Academic credentials, professional experience and technical competence to deliver meaningful, successful training in a classroom environment or via web conference or videoconference, in an interactive, engaging manner and accurately respond to in-depth technical questions from course participants, in one or more of the subject areas (Structures, Hydraulics, Geotechnical).</p>
<p>c. An adequate number of highly qualified personnel available to meet the needs of the FHWA. What contingency plans are in place to replace key personnel over the life of the contract without any adverse impact on performance? Instructors certified in adult learning preferred. <br />2. Technical Approach<br />a. Contract objectives, needs, and potential problems are well understood. Technical approach is clear, sound, feasible, innovative, and achievable. Instructional design principles will be incorporated into the development and delivery of NHI Training courses. Proposal includes new ideas for incorporation of modern visualization tools.</p>
<p>b. Ability to clearly describe the objectives, needs, and the manner in which they will be addressed. Does not parrot the RFP language, but rather demonstrates a grasp of what is expected. Demonstrate a solid grasp of the subject area and familiarities with regulatory or programmatic issues that affect development and delivery of instructor-led and distance learning training.<br />3. Past Performance <br />a. The offeror's proposed team has documented recent successful experience related to the applicable task requirements.<br />b. Demonstrated recent successful experience developing final report reports and delivering effective presentations to technical audience in the transportation industry. <br />c. Acceptable degree of successful performance in prior technical service contracts. The Government will evaluate the merits of each offeror's past performance based on its reputation with its former customers including the Government. Evidence can include references, samples of correspondence from satisfied clients, letters of recommendation, etc.</p>
<p>3.1 PAST PERFORMANCE DEFINITIONS AND RATINGS</p>
<p>a. "Relevant experience" involves the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what the solicitation requires. "Somewhat relevant experience" involves the magnitude of effort and complexities including some of what the solicitation requires or is substantially related to. "Not relevant experience" does not involve any significant aspects of what the solicitation requires. A higher degree of relevancy will carry a higher weight when determining past performance ratings.</p>
<p>b. The Government may use information obtained from other sources, and will consider the currency, degree of relevance, source and context of the past performance information. Also, general trends in performance and demonstrated corrective actions will be considered. The Government may also consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel, other corporate entities or subcontractors where such information is relevant to this acquisition. A significant negative finding in any element may result in an overall high-risk rating.</p>
<p>c. Using those references deemed relevant or somewhat relevant together with other information obtained, the FHWA will assess the amount of risk associated with the offeror based on its past performance using the following scale:</p>
<p>Adjectival Color Description<br />Excellent [Very Low Risk] Blue Essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on their record. <br />Good [Low Risk] Green Little doubt exists based on the offeror's record that they can perform the proposed effort.<br />Adequate [Moderate Risk] Yellow Some doubt exists based on the offeror's record that they can perform the proposed effort.<br />Marginal [High Risk] Orange Significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform based on their record.<br />Poor [Very High Risk] Red It is extremely doubtful that the offeror will successfully perform based on their record.<br />Unknown Grey Little or no relevant record identifiable. No positive or negative evaluation significance.</p>
<p>The Government is not required to interview all points of contact identified by offerors.<br />4. Price</p>
<p>Cost/Price proposals will be evaluated for cost reasonableness and realism in accordance with FAR 15.404. Price will not be numerically scored. The Government will evaluate the proposed individual cost elements (labor rates, indirect rates, etc.) to ensure proposed cost elements are fair, reasonable, and allowable.</p>
<p>NOTE: Under the planned ID/IQ contract(s), prior to award of any Task Order, the Government will evaluate Task Order Price Proposals for cost/price reasonableness and Task Order Price Proposals will be negotiated as necessary.<br /><br />M.3 BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>In addition to the criteria listed above, price will be considered in the award decision. The proposals will be analyzed to assess their price reasonableness. This means that the prices in an offeror's proposal are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal.</p>
<p>The Government will accept the offer that is considered the best value to the Government. A best value analysis will be performed taking into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, cost and past performance analysis, and the perceived ability to perform timely, high quality, consistently reliable support services as provided herein.</p>
<p>In the determination of Best Value, the relative weight given to all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, is more important than price. However, offerors should note that as technical scores approach being essentially equivalent, cost would become more important in the selection decision.</p>

<DESC>The Past Performance Survey due date has changed from March 18th to March 25th.



SUBJECT:  Past Performance Survey
FOR PROVIDERS OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

    	VISN 18 Contracting El Paso, Texas, has issued a solicitation to provide Joint Commission's Statement of Conditions (SOC) Survey for Patient Care Buildings at the Albuquerque VA.
 
    	Past performance information will be used to evaluate quotes received.  Section A of the enclosed survey lists the contractor who has identified your office as a source to evaluate their past performance.  Section A also authorizes release of this information to VISN 18 Contracting El Paso, Texas.

    	An individual knowledgeable of the contractor's quality of supplies or services rendered should complete the survey, providing comments wherever applicable.  However, supplemental information from others in your organization is encouraged.  If evaluating more than one contract for the same contractor, use a separate survey for each contract being evaluated.

    	Because this information is critical to the evaluation process, your time and effort in providing it is greatly appreciated.  The survey should be completed as soon as possible but not later than March 25, 2011 2 PM ET.  Send electronically to carlos.jaquez@va.gov

The following Rating Scale provides the definitions for the Past Performance ratings to be assessed:

E	EXCEPTIONAL
Based on the Offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Past performance has met contractual requirements and has exceeded some to the respondent's benefit.  Contractual performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor were highly effective.

V	VERY GOOD
Based on the Offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Past performance has met contractual requirements and has exceeded some to the respondent's benefit.  Contractual performance was accomplished with some minor problem(s) for which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor were effective.

S	SATISFACTORY
Based on the Offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Past performance has met contractual requirements.  Contractual performance contains some minor problem(s) for which corrective action(s) taken by the contractor appear or where satisfactory.

M	MARGINAL	
Based on Offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Past performance has not met some contractual requirements.  Contractual performance reflects a serious problem for which either the contractor has not yet identified correction action(s), or the proposed corrective action(s) appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.

U	UNSATISFACTORY
Based on Offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Past performance has not met most contractual requirements, and recovery did not occur or was not in a timely manner.  Contractual performance contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective action(s) appear or were ineffective.

N	NEUTRAL
No performance record identifiable; unknown performance.

The questions on the survey shall be rated in accordance with the definitions provided in the Rating Scale. Any unsatisfactory or marginal rating shall be supplemented with an explanation in the space provided.

<DESC>Vendor Demonstration Opportunity Amendment<br><br>This Mission and Installation Contracting Command Fort Bliss is hosting a Mock Training Special Effects Industry Day on 31 March - 1 April 2011.  The intent for this event is to allow vendors to provide demonstrations or information on their products focused on training aids for live fire targetry concepts, battlefield effects, and training aids.  We anticipate holding an open forum discussion setting on Day 1 to discuss contracting strategies, industry standards, and the command vision.  This will be an opportunity for contractors and Army personnel to network and share ideas.  A representative from several installation offices will attend and give a presentation on the proposed vision and the business model for contracting.   <br><br>All suggestions are welcome to make this a worthwhile event for everyone.   All interested vendors/contractors are invited to RSVP their attendance as space will be limited for the event.  We may have future events for more specific topics of interest.<br><br>Day One - 31 March 2011<br><br>The first day will begin at approximately 9:00 AM with round table discussions followed by static displays that provide the visitor literature about the product and an opportunity for a "hands-on" experience.  <br><br>Day Two - 1 April 2011<br><br>The second day will consist of demonstrations of products that may require more space than the previous day's venue, scheduled by vendor for an audience of military and civilians.  The second day will be conducted on a range or area on East Fort Bliss that will allow for pyrotechnics and remotely operated devices to be used; it will not support live-fire demonstrations that would include projectiles or bullets to be used.  <br><br>The goal of the event is to develop best practices for future contract solicitations for the equipment, supplies, services listed in the following pages.  In these days of constricting budgets, Fort Bliss is looking for ways to provide cutting edge realistic training "Better, Faster, Cheaper, and Safer."  <br>

<SUBJECT>Special notice of intent to award a contract on a sole source basis for the management of the National Nuclear Security Administrations Retained Segment of the University of California Retirement Plan
<SOLNBR>DENA0000538
<RESPDATE>040411
<CONTACT>Lori Nebeker, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-845-4755, Fax 505-845-5753, Email lnebeker@doeal.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Business Services intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Regents of the University of California (UC), Oakland CA, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. This action is a 5 year service contract for the administration of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) "retained segment" pension fund including submittal of required reports.&nbsp; The Office of Business Services anticipates that this effort will be available only from the UC and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded to UC because it is the sole responsible source available to manage and administer the University of California Retirement Plan (UCRP) for certain former employees of the UC at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and their eligible beneficiaries. The work described in the attachments cannot be performed by any entity other than UC unless the government expended considerable legal and actuarial expenses to remove the interests of the former UC employees at LANL and LLNL from the UCRP and subsequently established a private sector pension plan that provides the same benefits as the UCRP. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 525110.
<p>The UC managed and operated LANL for the Department of Energy pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-36 from January 1, 1943, until May 31, 2006. UC also managed and operated LLNL for the Department of Energy pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-48 from September 2, 1952, until September 30, 2007. NNSA awarded Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS), a limited liability corporation, the contract to manage and operate LANL and LANS assumed operations of LANL on June 1, 2006. NNSA awarded Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), also a limited liability corporation, the contract to manage and operate LLNL and LLNS assumed operations of LLNL on October 1, 2007.</p>
<p>During the time that UC operated LANL and LLNL (Laboratories) the employees at the Laboratories were UC employees and participated in the UCRP. The UCRP is a governmental defined benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code section 414(d) that was established for employees of a state entity, the University of California. After LANS and LLNS (Contractors) were awarded the respective contracts, but before the Contractors assumed full responsibility for operation of the laboratories, the Contractors presented UC employees with the choice to 1) remain in the UCRP as terminated vested participants or 2) participate in a newly established private sector defined benefit pension plan that was designed to offer the same accrued benefits, to the extent practicable given the rules that apply to private sector plans, that were offered under the UCRP. Employees who elected to remain in the UCRP as terminated vested participants in the UCRP as well as retirees from the Laboratories under the UCRP, eligible beneficiaries and other former laboratory employees who have a terminated vested interest in the UCRP comprise the finite universe of UCRP participants whose assets and liabilities are calculated separately from the rest of the participants in the UCRP pursuant to contracts between UC and NNSA.</p>
<p>Though the management and operating duties at LANL now are performed by a private company, pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-36, UC must perform accounting and financial reporting for the LANL Retained Segment which is defined in the current contract as "the portion of UCRP represented by the assets and liabilities accrued through May 31, 2006, and associated with the benefits of Retained Members and Beneficiaries." Similarly, at LLNL, pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-48, UC must perform accounting and financial reporting for the LLNL Retained Segment which is defined as "the portion of UCRP represented by the assets, including the Contribution Reserve Amount, and liabilities accrued through September 30, 2007, and associated with the benefits of Retained Members and Beneficiaries." Retained Members for both the LANL and LLNL segments are 1) retirees of the UCRP 2) terminated vested participants of the UCRP and 3) disability income recipients under UCRP or deceased participants with respect to any survivor entitled to benefits.</p>
<p>Both contracts require UC to perform the following activities: provide an accounting of the assets in the Retained Segment, submit reports to NNSA that reflect the annual actuarial valuation for the UCRP and for the Retained Segment, submit to NNSA a copy of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 87 report prepared by the UCRP each year and calculate anticipated NNSA contributions for the Retained Segment. In addition, the contracts require UC to administer the UCRP and its trust fund as fiduciaries of the UCRP. Under the contracts, NNSA is obligated to fund the Retained Segments pursuant to the terms set forth in the respective contracts.</p>
<p>The duties set forth in the attached contract sections will be consolidated into one contract with the goal of ultimately closing&nbsp;Contracts W-7405-ENG-36 and W-7405-ENG-48. Portions of the current contracts pertaining to the Retained Segments with UC are attached to the synopsis for informational purposes.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement by Apr 4, 2011, 4:00 P.M. Mountain Time, to Ms Lori L Nebeker, Contract Specialist, National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Business Services, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185; or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:lnebeker@doeal.gov">lnebeker@doeal.gov</a>. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NNSA will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.</p>

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation. For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives. Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level. If at any level of indentation an Offer's submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation. Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level. The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government. The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract. Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements. There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards. Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements. The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government. The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements. Disadvantages are minimal. There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards. The information represents an acceptable solution. Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas. A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved. The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements. No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral. There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement. The offeror's interpretation of the Government's requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient. The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating. The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government. There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable. There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards. Unacceptable. Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal. There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved. The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<br><br>5.

<DESC>The SCoE will consolidate the missions and functions of the Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM), Quartermaster School, Transportation School, Ordnance School and Army Logistics University (ALU) formerly the Army Logistics Management College (ALMC). The SCoE is being established as the result of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 Congressional decision to consolidate missions and functions at Fort Lee, VA; with the Ordnance Mechanical Maintenance School moving from Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; the Ordnance Munitions and Electronics Maintenance School from Redstone Arsenal, AL; and elements of the Transportation School moving from Fort Eustis, VA. The SCoE brings together these schools, and as a single organization is responsible for nearly all Army sustainment training, leader education, and associated combat developments. Ordnance School trains in the fields of material maintenance and integrated material management, ground mobility material, logistics management (ammunition supply, maintenance, and life cycle), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and combat support and combat service support tests. Quartermaster School trains supply, field services, aerial delivery, and mortuary affairs. Transportation School trains current and future Army transportation capability, Intermodal Operations, Maritime, and rail. ALU will become the lifelong learning center for Professional Military Education (Officer Education System (OES), Warrant Officer Education System (WOES), and Noncommissioned Officer Education System (NCOES)), Civilian Education, and Joint, Multinational and Interagency education.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. We have a requirement for a Culvert Replacement at Honey Creek. This Request for Quote (RFQ) will be for two proposals per SOW with the project completion by NLT 1 October 2011 subject to increment weather condition.<br><br>This contract has one CLIN-0001: Total cost to replace culvert and complete other tasks identified in the Scope of Work.<br><br><br>Section C<br>Scope of Work<br><br>1.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor and any necessary equipment to install Government furnished; pre-cast box culverts for a tank trail crossing over Honey Creek at Fort Riley, Kansas.  Technical Exhibit 1 indicates the project site.<br><br>2.  The Contractor shall submit two proposals for the project.  <br>a. Proposal one shall be for the installation of pre-cast culverts delivered to the construction site prior to the project commencing.  <br>b. Proposal two shall be for both the transportation of the pre-cast culverts from a location on Fort Riley approximately 13 miles from the construction site and the installation of the pre-cast culverts after transport. <br> The Government will accept the proposal that is in its best interest.<br><br>3.  The Government will provide the Contractor with two paper sets of plans.  The plans are not to scale and are for general guidance.  The Contractor shall return one set of plans with "as constructed" to note any field changes to the Government within 5 business days of completion of the project.<br><br>4.  An electronic copy of the plans is located at Technical Exhibit 2(Chg-1).  Potential bidders may obtain a paper copy of the plans by contacting Mr. Mike Houck, Biologist, at 785-239-2537.<br><br>5.  The Government will provide basic staking of the construction site based on the plans and on-site conditions at time of construction.<br><br>6.  The Contractor shall remove the existing metal culvert and install pre-cast box culverts following normal industry standards at the location noted on the plans and staked at the site.<br><br>7.  The Contractor shall insure the new pre-cast culverts are installed in a matter that does not alter the streambed gradient.  Culverts should be set on best available on-site material and compacted for firm base.  As per drawing, the Contractor shall set one or two culverts below the natural streambed gradient to allow for natural stream flow.  The finished installation shall allow fish passage and shall not back normal water flow upstream of the structure, shall not create any measurable plunge pool on the downstream side, and shall not create a pond or pooled situation over the face of the crossing.  The Contractor shall set the additional culverts above the lower culvert(s) level to handle high flow periods.<br><br>8.  The Contractor shall also install a concrete cap above the lower culverts that shall create a level surface over the entire culvert system. <br><br>9.  The Contractor shall use any rock and soil material removed from the existing roadbed site to cover the culverts.  Road surface material will be removed and used to resurface the road after construction is completed.  If additional cover is required, the Government, working with the Contractor, will designate a borrow site near the construction site.<br><br>10.  The Contractor shall install appropriate size rock on each culvert face or adjacent slopes to reduce future erosion potential. Trans-located rock obtained on-site may be used for this activity.  During any activities utilizing trans-located rock, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the natural stream channel and its habitat.  If rock retrieval from the downstream channel is determined likely to adversely impact habitat within the stream channel or addition rock is required, the Contractor shall obtain new rock from an on-installation quarry site designated by the government.  The Contractor will be responsible for loading and transporting rock from quarry site.<br><br>11.  The Contractor shall deposit the existing culvert at a location to be designated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during final staking.  The Government will be responsible for final deposition of the culvert.<br><br>12.  The Contractor shall not conduct construction activities below the water's surface in Honey Creek during the Topeka shiner spawning period of May 15 to July 31. inclusive.  <br><br>13.

The Contractor shall install erosion control structures as necessary to minimize downstream sedimentation during all activities.<br><br>15.  The Contractor shall clear only those trees, brush, and other debris necessary to install the culverts and access the streambed.  Trees, brush, and debris shall be piled in such a manner as not to obstruct stream flow nor block current access route.  <br><br>16.  The Contractor shall implement and maintain best management practices for erosion control throughout the duration of all project activities located in runoff areas to the stream.<br><br>17.  The Contractor shall provide seeding and/or mulching within all stream runoff areas as soon as grading allow, following the end of construction.<br><br>18.
