<SUBJECT>A -- Deep Ultraviolet Avalanche Photodetectors (DUVAP)
<SOLNBR>BAA06-14
<RESPDATE>022806
<ARCHDATE>02282007
<CONTACT>Henryk Temkin, Program Manager, Phone 571-218-4681, Email henryk.temkin@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of deep ultraviolet avalanche photodetectors.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

The Deep Ultraviolet Avalanche Photodetectors (DUVAP) program has a nominal goal of demonstrating arrays of APDs (or combinations of APDs and filters) capable of operating at a wavelength of 280 nm with the effective Geiger mode gain of 10 to the sixth power. The desired arrays are expected to work with an effective aperture up to a square centimeter and field of view up to 60 degrees, with a solar photon rejection ratio of 10 to the sixth power. 

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  

I.  Technical Area One: UV avalanche photodetector and photodetector array development. This area represents the main focus of Phases I and II of the program.  The interests for this area include, but are not limited to, the development and demonstration of UV avalanche photodetectors capable of Geiger mode operation.  To be consistent with the ultimate goal of inclusion of the photodetector in a NLOS system, particular emphasis will be placed on high quantum efficiency, low dark current at breakdown, and high effective gain.  

II. Technical Area Two: Development of UV filters. During Phases I and II of the program there will be emphasis on the design of a UV filter with a high degree of solar rejection.  The filter design will need to assure wide field of view.  Integration of the filter with the photodetector array should be considered.  

III. Technical Area Three:  Integration of solar-blind arrays of UV APDs into a NLOS Communication System.  This area represents the main focus of Phase III of the program. Detailed performance of the APD-based NLOS system should be specified by the performer.  Formation of arrays of Geiger mode APDs will require preparation of photodetectors with high yield.  The yield definition should be provided by the performer.  

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-14 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

The Deep Ultraviolet Avalanche Photodetectors (DUVAP) program will consist of a Phase I (duration of Phase I should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), followed by a Phase II and Phase III (duration of Phase II and Phase III should be specified by proposers in the full proposal), for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Offerors wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site (http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams) has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Henryk Temkin, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA06-14@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-14, Deep Ultraviolet Avalanche Photodetectors, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on UV avalanche photodetector and avalanche photodetector array development, development of UV filters, integration of solar-blind arrays of UV APDs into an NLOS communication system, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, FedGrants website: http://www.fedgrants.gov/,World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. 

 In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and nine (9) copies of the proposal abstract and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the abstract [in PDF, or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM] should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-14, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy     of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-14) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, January 9, 2006.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.

Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and nine (9) copies of the full proposal and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-14, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy     of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-14) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, February 28, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-14, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in deep ultraviolet avalanche photodetectors. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 06-14.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, (5) cost realism, and (6) offeror's ability to propose and execute an accurate development schedule with realistic performance metrics. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

The WPBs Propulsion Main Drive Diesel-Electric Control systems were designed and manufactured by MTU specifically for the Coast Guard.  When Coast Guard Headquarters purchased the original equipment there were no requirements for manufacturer’s engineering drawings, circuit card artwork, detailed parts lists, design or testing procedures.  MTU is the only known manufacturer that has the techniques, design specifications, testing, quality assurance capability, and documentation necessary to manufacture this circuit card assembly as used on the Coast Guard 87 foot boats.  Complete design specifications and documentation are proprietary in nature and not available for sale to the Coast Guard.

7.	Impact to the Government if not awarded in accordance with the above:
These boards must conform to exacting design and materials requirements for form, fit, function in order mount, connect and interface with the current Propulsion Main Drive Diesel-Electric system to meet the needs and mission requirements of the Coast Guard.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Battelle Memorial Institute under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), based on their unsolicited proposal entitled, “International Cooperative Research Program For Maximizing Enhancements in Risk Informed Technology (MERIT) For Commercial Nuclear Power Plants” submitted to the NRC in September 2004.   The purpose of this contract, based upon an unsolicited proposal, is to enhance risk assessment tools now used as one of the cornerstones for the maintenance and operation of commercial nuclear power plants through the creation of an international cooperative research program to be known as MERIT.   Specifically, the following tasks will be performed under the contract: (1) study of  degradation mechanisms associated with non-piping components in order to reduce uncertainty associated with this contribution to the overall loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) frequency determination (2) assessment of primary water stress corrision cracking (PWSCC) in different locations and for multiple cracks; and (3) update of NRC computer codes (NRCPIPE, NRCPIPES and seepage quantification of upsets in reactor tubes (SQUIRT)) and databases (pipe FRACture mechanics property database (PIFRAC), CIRCUMferentially Cracked piping database (CIRCUMCR), and AXIALly Cracked piping database (AXIALCR)) that Battelle previously developed.  The proposed effort is a continuation of work begun over the past 20 years under other similarly structured international programs including International Piping Integrity Research Group (IPIRG) and Battelle Integrity of Nuclear Piping (BINP) and under the NRC Large-Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LB-LOCA) Program.  The proposed contract will be cost-reimbursement type contract.  The period of performance is three years from date of contract award.   This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes or a solicitation of offers.  Interested firms must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform the required services to the above address not later than January 25, 2006.  Capability statements that do not fully demonstrate the respondent’s ability to satisfy the requirements above will not be considered.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5415   The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in need of acquiring professional services on a sole source basis from Dell Inc. for reconfiguration of Dell servers procured under a separate Purchase Order.  Dell will implement a multi-node Oracle 10g Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) in an Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) environment configured on Dell 1850 servers using the RedHat Linux operating system connected to an EMC Cx500 Storage Area Network via QLA2340 Gb Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters.  This  statement of work primarily is concerned with the correct installation and configuration of a single 2-node Oracle cluster in the above described environment. This task requires the contractor to design and deploy a topology for this 2-node collection of servers. The architecture and deployment of  the Oracle 10g RAC environment also shall include the implementation of the Oracle 10g RDBMS.  After the environment is operating, as expected by the Contract Officer Representative, the contractor shall provide the delivery of knowledge transfer for a hands-on solution to orient OPP staff and  their designated contractors to assure customer acceptance of Oracle 10g RAC readiness in the anticipated environment.  This task requires the contractor to transfer all requisite installation and configuration knowledge to OPP staff and contractors to enable OPP to perform similar installations at  the OPP site.  OPP plans include the creation of an identical 2-node Test environment.  After the Development and Test environments are successfully implemented, OPP plans are to create a 4-node Production environment that will also include a 2-node Backup server configuration and a 2-node Oracle  Internet Directory (OID) authentication environment to be integrated with Test, Development and Production to form an Oracle Grid.  All environments will utilize the EMC CX500 Storage Area Network for primary storage.  The knowledge transfer phase of this work assignment requires the contractor to  provide OPP staff and designated contractors with sufficient knowledge to configure and install Oracle 10g RAC in the described Test and Production environments without additional support.  Should there be another contractor who can perform these services more expeditiously or less costly than  Dell, please contact Olvier Voss at 202-564-4514.

<DESC>This is a synopsis with a separately issued solicitation.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services regarding The Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis. 
	
The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

Scope:  The contractor shall determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  Minimum number of samples is 1,650.  

Anticipated Period of Performance:  One (1) year after initial award, only one award will be made. 

Solicitation:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Request for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  Requests shall include name of the contractor, complete mailing address, DUNS number, telephone and fax numbers, point of contact and electronic mail address, business size standard, and identify the RFQ requested as RFQ-NCI-60016-NG on all correspondence.  The deadline of this synopsis is December 21, 2005 at 1 PM EST.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation is December 27, 2005 and the estimated due date is January 13, 2005.

<DESC>This effort involves upgrading the core electronics and antenna facilities at the Diego Garcia Remote Tracking Station B-side (DGS-B).  DGS-B, located on the island of Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory, is one of eight Remote Tracking Stations (RTS) that, together with two control centers, comprise the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN).  The AFSCN is DoD’s primary network for launch and early orbit operations.  The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination and processing, and is the world’s only high-powered network for emergency recovery.

The island currently consists of an A-side Automatic Remote Tracking Station (ARTS).  DGS-B is the fifth article of the RTS Block Change (RBC) upgrade/modernization effort.  The RBC upgrades to the AFSCN are the next step in the evolution towards the Integrated Satellite Control Network (ISCN).  

DGS-B is the only tracking station located in the southern hemisphere.  Eastern hemisphere loading is expected to peek in 2006.  The RBC upgrade at Diego Garcia is key to ensuring uninterrupted operational capability to our AFSCN users.  Due to mission need, and funding requirements, any interested contractor must begin work in FY 06 and deliver the final product NLT 30 September 2008.  The upgrade at DGS-B will include, but may not be limited to, the following deliverables:

	Procurement of upgraded Configuration Item (CI) hardware/software; Site-specific installation design and antenna facility construction; Modified design/installation drawings and/or documentation; Assembly, integration, and testing of the core CI at the integration and test support facility; Installation and test of hardware/software at the RTS; Assembly and checkout of Antenna CI at vendor; Installation and test of Antenna at the RTS; High Power Amplifier (HPA) hardware/software acquisition; Installation and testing of the HPA at the I&TSF; Installation and test of HPA at the RTS; Support Government conducted Boresight and Pre-IST tests; Dehumidification/Desalinization Environmental Control Enhancement Unit; Anemometer Blower Latching Option; DGS-B GPS SAASM; Site selection

Sri Lanka Sewerage Infrastructure for Tsunami Affected Towns Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to provide an estimate of the needs and costs associated with the development of a sewerage and sanitation infrastructure system in the coastal cities of Sri Lanka.

The Ministry of Urban Development and Water Supply (MUDWS) has received grant funding from USTDA for a Feasibility Study that will assess the viability of a piped sewerage infrastructure system in the tsunami damaged coastal regions.  MUDWS creates opportunities to enhance the quality of life and better living environment for the people of Sri Lanka through well-planned urban development, the provision of safe drinking water, and improved sanitation standards. 

At present there are no piped sewers or wastewater treatment systems in the Tsunami affected areas in the coastal zones.  New piped sewer systems should be considered as a part of the rebuilding of Galle, Matara, Hambantota and Negombo and other tsunami-affected cities.  In addition, centralized sewerage treatment facilities are needed for resettlement areas in all the cities to improve the environment and create health benefits by reducing the amount of untreated sewage that is discharged into the sea.  

The primary objectives of the Study are to: review the current conditions in the districts affected by the tsunami; establish the basic needs criteria for at least two urban locales; outline a number of options for wastewater treatment systems and operations that could be used in implementing projects in these two locales, and; provide cost estimate analyses of the systems and operations.  Additionally, the Study would evaluate, propose, and identify appropriate influent and effluent design parameters for new wastewater treatment systems in the selected locations.  This Study will consider the most effective system for the tsunami impacted districts and provide the MUDWS with the information necessary to determine the best system to meet the infrastructure needs for Sri Lanka.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $491,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by no later than 5:00pm Local Time, January 25, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899 has a requirement for face velocity readings to be obtained on all the fume hoods on site. A system check is also required to be performed on the pressurized side. Any deficiencies found shall be reported and if approved by the NIST authorized representative, repaired. Most hoods are served by a dedicated exhaust fan located in the attic level of the laboratory buildings. There is approximately 10 feet of positive pressure ductwork on the outlet side of each fan. Other hoods in the newer buildings are served by a general exhaust system. All interior positive pressure exhaust ducts shall be leak tested. NIST has approximately 545 fume hoods located in various buildings around the site. These hoods are used by scientists and researchers on a daily basis. Most of the hoods are used for a variety of tasks as determined by the needs of the user, the overall majority are for general purpose use; however, there are hoods used for radioactive materials, and acids.  

The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and material necessary to perform the following : (1) The contractor shall perform a visible observation and inspection of mechanical components, fans, ductwork and flex connections for each hood and shall verify the flow sensors are working properly; (2) The contractor shall identify any problems found with the hoods while performing this work, this information shall be submitted to the NIST authorized representative as each building is completed; (3) The contractor shall make repairs upon approval by the Contracting Officer as authorized via a written modification to the purchase order.

The test shall be performed as outlined in the Shortridge Operating Instructions, dated 2/21/2003, Chapter 6.0, Section 6.5, titled: Velgrid Air Velocity, as included with the ADM-860. The Contractor is required to complete a grid sheet with average readings and the NIST form ED-2 for each hood tested. NIST shall provide these forms to the Contractor. These completed forms shall be submitted to the NIST authorized representative for record keeping purposes. The 73 fume hoods located in building 224 have already had the face velocity readings checked, however, a leak check of the positive pressurized ducts and inspection of mechanical components etc. shall still be performed. The awarded Contractor obtaining the face velocity readings shall provide at least three (3) hours of hands on training to the NIST HVAC personnel on the proper methods used for obtaining the readings and shall follow all instructions as outlined in the NIST PLANT DIVISION INSTRUCTIONS. (P.D.I.)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.

Proposers will be evaluated on Technical Factors as follows: Factor A--Past Performance; Factor B—Small Business Subcontracting Effort; Factor C—Technical Qualifications, and Factor D – Technical Approach.  
If award is not made on initial proposals, then a competitive range determination will be made for this solicitation which will be based on technical and price and include the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For evaluation purposes only in determining the competitive range, the Government will calculate the total price proposal.  After a competitive range determination is made and final proposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made.  If discussions are conducted, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal revision.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous  (best value) to the Government.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT AND LIMITED COMPETITION AWARD.  The Space and Missile Systems Center, Detachment 12 (SMC Det 12), Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source five-year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with ATK Thiokol, Inc, Corinne, Utah for the aging surveillance (AS) of the SR118 and SR120 motors (Peacekeeper stage 1 and 3 respectively). In addition, RSLP will conduct a competition after exclusion of sources for the SR119 motor (Peacekeeper stage 2) between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet-General Corporation, Rancho Cordova, California under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), agency’s minimum needs can be satisfied by unique services available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources.  This effort will acquire aging surveillance services for the former Peacekeeper rocket motors for Stages 1 through 3 in support of the RSLP.  The services will allow RSLP to utilize the former PK rocket motors in a variety of applications.  ATK Thiokol will provide the Aging Surveillance (AS) for the SR118 and SR120 due to ATK Thiokol’s unique capabilities as the Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) and because they have provided AS for SR118, SR119, and SR120 for the last 7 years.  With regard to the SR119, RSLP will conduct a competition between ATK Thiokol and Aerojet, as these two companies have nearly the same unique capabilities.  Aerojet is the OEM and provided the AS support through 1997, and ATK Thiokol has provided AS services since 1997. Specific tasks will include providing all aspects of engineering and AS support, as required, to ensure flight worthiness on the SR118, SR119, and SR120 rocket motors and related components in support of RSLP. RSLP AS support requires the historical AS test data for all three motors in order to provide continuous trend analysis for determining the expected life of the motors and various age-sensitive components. This support includes test and analysis of the motors and components to determine 1) if there are age related trends, 2) the severity of the aging, and 3) mitigations to the effects of the aging.  For the SR119 and SR120 motors the government maintains a static fire capability and provides static fires.  For the SR118 motor the government requirement is for the contractor to maintain a static fire capability and provide static fires.  Additional support will include anomaly resolution or modification of the motor(s) related problem either identified from the AS program or due to a unique launch requirement. Interested firms should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 30 days of this announcement.  Submit the SOC to Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN, 3548 Aberdeen Avenue S.E., Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, 87117-5778.  The SOC must include sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the requisite technical expertise.  Foreign firms are advised that they will not be allowed to participate in this acquisition as a prime contractor.  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate its concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition to the proper channels. The ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, Phone Number (310) 363-3571. No solicitation document exists at this time.  Request for a solicitation will receive no response.  Questions pertaining to this announcement shall be directed to Contracts Manager, Ms Racelle Jensen, SMC Det 12/PKN at (505) 846-5103 or by E-mail at racelle.jensen@kirtland.af.mil, Mel Pearson, Contracting Officer, (505) 853-3503 or by Email at mel.pearson@kirtland.af.mil.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with International Business Machines (IBM) under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements” to provide benchmarking assistance with technical and machine resources in support of performance tuning the IBM DB2 Record Manager product on the z/OS platform.  In support of the Records Manager Software port to the z/OS platform, SSA has identified the need to utilize IBM's Gaithersburg Testing facility to establish benchmarks and transaction throughput on the z/OS platform prior to the installation of the RM software on the SSA Mainframe due to the lack of capacity on the SSA system at this time. The availability of the IBM System allows the SSA team access to a mainframe to perform this benchmark testing without having to interfere with existing SSA systems. The need for the task has evolved only as the project has progressed. The need has become critical since the internal system lacks the necessary capacity.
	
The IBM Corporation is the only known source capable of satisfying SSA’s requirements.  Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data (including GSA Schedule information) within 15 days of this announcement.  Responses must be addressed to the procuring office below:	Social Security Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants, Attention: Division of I.T. Support Services, 7111 Boulevard Place, Suite 100, Baltimore, Maryland  21244. 
                                        
The Government does not intend to pay for information received.  All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered.  As a result of analyzing responses to this notice of intent, the contracting officer may determine that a solicitation will be issued.  If a solicitation is issued, a synopsis will be published. All inquiries must be in writing to the address above or to Anne.Cary@ssa.gov; no phone requests will be honored.

<CONTACT>Marlene Quade, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-4751, Fax 301-427-2164, Email marlene.quade@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for an upcoming requirement of DMSP Support for the DOC/NOAA/ NESDIS/NPOESS project.  All responses must have substantial documentation that addresses the requirements in this announcement in order for the Government to determine if your company is able to do the work required.  This is an on-going effort and no down time will be acceptable for any of the segments.  All information must be sent to Ms. Marlene S. Quade, Contracting Officer, 8455 Colesville Road, Ste 1450, Silver Spring, MD  20910.  
The Department of Defense requires an enduring and survivable capability to provide the United States military with accurate worldwide weather information. This capability is provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), which collects and disseminates global visible and infrared cloud data in support of worldwide operations and high priority programs.  The global data must be provided in a timely manner to users at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC).  The DoD also needs a capability to collect and disseminate other specialized meteorological, terrestrial, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical data to users.  Users require these services through all levels of conflict in which they are capable of surviving.  DMSP consists of a space segment, link segment, ground segment, and user segment.  
Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. There are currently 6 operational DMSP satellites on orbit: two are designated primary, two are secondary, one is partially operational, and one is reserved for testing only.  The DMSP mission is expected to continue until 2019.  
The DMSP ground system network is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The ground segment consists of the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; AFSCN tracking stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA tracking stations in Fairbanks, AK, and Wallops, VA; user sites at AFWA, Omaha, NE, and FNMOC, at Monterey, CA.  Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  Future operational nodes may include McMurdo Ground Station, Antarctica, and the Svalsat Ground Station in Svalbard, Norway.


GROUND SEGMENT REQUIREMENTS
Support for the ground system will include hardware and software component supply, repair, test, maintenance, upgrade, and technical support.  System upgrades, which include new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) components, shall be integrated into existing legacy systems in such a manner as to ensure requirements for timely and enduring data delivery are met.   Current software/OS consist of:  Open VMS, Windows NT/2000, Unix, Oracle, MS SQL, PVWAVE, EPOCH, and What’s Up Gold.  Programming languages consist of Fortran, C++, Ada, and PERL.  Network protocols consist of TCP/IP and DECNET.  

The Command Control and Communication (C3) system uses COTS and custom built hardware and software to provide satellite S-Band (2207.5—2252.5 MHz) command up-link and data down-link capability.  This includes equipment such as the Telemetry and Command System (TCS), Dual Decommutator and Command processor (DDCP), System Communications Unit (SCU), ARTS Interface Unit (AIU), Aiken Switch, and Data Quality Monitor (DQM).  The TCS is a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) platform running custom code that maintains satellite telemetry and command databases, generates satellite loads and commands, archives data and logs for engineering analysis, provides information for display on operations consoles and controls overall ground system function.    The DDCP is a custom designed device that provides decommutation and time-tagging of DMSP real-time and stored payload telemetry and outputs data via TCP/IP to the TCS via custom developed code.  It performs DMSP satellite command and load formatting, authentication, and echo check verification as well as provides KG control. Command and control, telemetry, and mission data up-link and down-link flows through cryptographic processors including KG-61 and KG-144.  The SCU is a custom designed device that provides point-to-point and broadcast inter-site communications via a TDM scheme and specialized formatting to ensure the reliable delivery of DMSP mission, telemetry, and commanding data between DMSP ground locations. The AIU is a modified, commercially available command processor that provides a direct interface with AFSCN tracking sites.  The Aiken Switch is a 20+ year old legacy component that provides switching and routing of DMSP DOMSAT links, SCUs, and TCS strings.  The input and output of all DMSP commanding and telemetry routes through and is controlled by the Aiken Switch.  DQM is a Windows XP based custom coded tool that allows users and operators to monitor data quality as it is down-linked.  DQM will provide the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) with a robust switching capability for multiple DOMSAT streams for its ingest processors.  The DMSP ground system network provides interconnectivity between all sites, users, and operations centers with TCP/IP based communications systems, DOMSAT links (3.2256 Mbps), and T1 connections.  The network is presently divided into three subsystems:  Communications, Switching, and Processing.  Many network components are integrated into more then one subsystem.  DMSP C3 support shall include in-depth comprehension of the DMSP C3 system, from operator interface to satellite command, control, and data recovery through to data receipt, quality monitoring, and ingest at AFWA and FNMOC.  DMSP C3 support will also include sustainment engineering for mission unique software, independent test analyses and problem isolation.  

The Government requires Level 1, 2, and 3 for depot level support on all operational and spare hardware.  The Government requires a ground segment mission reliability of 99.8%.  The ground segment operational availability rate will be 99.7% with a mean time between critical failures of the ground segment greater than 328 hours.  The mean time to repair the ground segment shall be less than 1 hour and the maximum corrective maintenance time of all repair actions shall not exceed 3 hours.  AFWA and FNMOC shall receive 100% of global smooth data within 10 minutes of downlink, and 100% of find data within 4 hours of downlink.  


SERVICES INFORMATION

Required services will include technical support to all DMSP equipment at any site.  Technical support includes development, integration, and preventive and corrective maintenance. DMSP will need supply storage at a Contractor depot location for all depot items.  The Contractor shall furnish all facilities, parts, materials, data, equipment and services.  In order to meet the timely data delivery requirements, the Program will require on-call emergency technical support to any DMSP ground segment site, system engineering and analysis of ground segment equipment, configuration management, and feasibility studies for system enhancements and modifications.   The Program also requires sustaining engineering, system performance analysis, and test support.  Because of the use of legacy equipment, component and operational system modifications will be needed.  Modifications will include design, develop, fabricate, test, produce, manufacture, install modification kits and update all required technical documentation.  Support for the DMSP ground segment will include interaction and in-depth knowledge of the AFSCN, access to AFSCN sites, and support at AFSCN technical meetings.  DMSP support includes launch and early orbit support for DMSP spacecraft, providing ground system expertise and on-site support to the operations command center in Suitland MD.  Interaction with government and other contractors, as well as independent work, for launch and early orbit anomaly resolution related to the DMSP ground system will be required.  In addition, the contractor shall be able to send and receive equipment to CONUS and international locations, work with foreign governments and contractors to track, inventory, and/or transfer custody of equipment.  A SECRET clearance is necessary for this effort.  Services will include part-time availability of a knowledgeable engineer with access to Schriever AFB, CO, and a full-time engineer in Suitland, MD.  Engineering labor categories include software, system, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and quality assurance.  Other labor categories may include scientist, program management, administrative, and logistics.  DMSP requires investigating new technologies, software releases, and commercial off the shelf (COTS) technologies, and then testing and integrating these new acquisitions into the current system.  The Contractor will be expected to develop a long term system engineering and sustainment plan for DMSP C3 and provide the government with recommendations and milestones to sustain the ground network.  All hardware and software upgrades will meet the Department of Commerce’s Information Technology security requirements.   

Steps are near completion to begin replacement of the System Communications Units (SCUs) within the DMSP ground system.  These steps included tasks needed to identify, test, and demonstrate potential commercial equipment that can enable NOAA to potentially transform its data handling of DMSP bit stream data to an IP switched packet network.  It also included the associated design work to integrate the selected replacement device into the ground system with the least possible impact.  Work to procure, install, integrate and test the SCU replacement devices within the ground system will need to be started during this effort.

<DESC>1.0	PURPOSE
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial vendors to provide systems’ solutions that will meet the implementation requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12.  Specifically GSA is seeking information on the capability of commercial vendors to deploy, operate, and maintain system solutions that provide one or more of the following core components for HSPD-12 systems 
·	Registration system/services;
·	Identity Management System/services;
·	Card Management System/services;
·	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certification Authority Services
·	Card Printing System/services.

This solution must comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) and applicable NIST Special Publications developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Respondents are requested to 

(a)	Identify current capacity to deploy, operate and maintain one or more HSPD-12 functional system components as identified in this RFI,

(b)	Identify a capacity to deploy operate and maintain one or more HSPD-12 functional system components as identified in this RFI by August 27, 2006 (60 days prior to PIV II deadline),

(c)	Identify a capacity to provide on-going operations and maintenance of the identified system components including 7x24 operations, 7x24 help desk capability and training services, 

(d)	Identify a capacity to provide the service in a highly available manner with a calculated service level at no less than 99.9% calculated on a monthly basis (43 minutes/month unplanned outage),

(e)	Identify a 5 year estimate of costs based on “number of cards issued” for 100,000 cardholders, 250,000 cardholders, 500,000 cardholders and > 1 million cardholders (initial year and four (4) years of O&M), and

(f)	Optionally demonstrate the identified solution(s).  

Alternatively, respondents are requested to submit proposals addressing alternative HSPD-12 service-based solutions with a) explanation why the alternative is better than the recommended approach in this RFI and b) answers to a though f in the above paragraph.  

2.0	BACKGROUND
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), issued by President George W. Bush on August 27, 2004, mandates the establishment of a standard for identification of Federal Government employees and contractors. HSPD-12 requires the use of a common identification credential for both logical and physical access to Federally-controlled facilities and information systems. This policy is intended to enhance security, increase efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy. 

The Department of Commerce and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) were tasked with producing a standard for a secure and reliable form of identification. In response, NIST published Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201), Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, on February 25, 2005. This standard is accomplished in the form of a PIV card and associated digital credentials that comply with the FIPS 201 standard and are used for both physical and logical access control, and other applications as determined by the individual agencies. FIPS 201 consists of two parts: PIV I and PIV II. The standards in PIV I support the control objectives and security requirements described in HSPD-12. The standards in PIV II support the technical interoperability requirements described in HSPD-12. PIV II also specifies standards for implementing identity credentials on smart cards for use in the Federal PIV system. 

HSPD-12 requires that the Federal credential (the PIV) card be secure and reliable, which is defined as a credential that:
·	Is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual’s identity;
·	Is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist exploitation;
·	Can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
·	Is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official accreditation process
3.0	HSPD-12 CORE SYSTEM TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
This section describes the functions to be performed and the certification and compliance standards for the HSPD-12 core system. Respondents must ensure the solution described is fully compliant with the referenced standards, and any certifications included in those standards:
·	FIPS 201: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 25 February 2005
·	SP 800-73: Special Publication 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), April 2005
·	OMB Implementation Guide: Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 – Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Office of Management and Budget, M-05-24, DRAFT 5 August 2005.
·	NIST 800-79: Guidelines for the Certification and Accreditation of PIV Card Issuing Organizations, Publication No. 800-79, NIST, July 2005
·	OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, OMB, 28 November 2000
·	Federal Identity Management Handbook, OMB, September 2005.

In addition, the proposed solution must ensure that the following functionality shall be available:
1.	Logging and audit capability must support both forensic and system management capabilities with minimum ability to a) reconstruct the chain of trust for PIV issuance and management, b) reconstruct access events to a given logical and/or physical asset and c) reconstruct access events by an individual cardholder.
2.	A flexible reporting functionality the allows data to be presented in graphical format, as well as filtered and sorted in any way necessary to present usage, operations, security, auditing, and management information.
3.	Controls to prevent cardholders from having more than one card issued at any one time.
4.	Support for separation of duties and roles segmented across departmental and agency lines.
5.	Support for separation of data management and administration across departmental and agency lines.
6.	Meets government privacy and confidentiality requirements.
7.	Seamless interfaces between the components of the proposed solution, and those not proposed but noted on the diagram provided below, specifically, the Personnel Management System(s), Background Investigation System, Physical Access Control Systems and Logical Access Control Systems.
8.	Ability to issue both SP800-73 Part 2 (transition) and Part 3 (endpoint) cards.


The Registration Function refers to the processes and information flows required for collecting identity information from registrants and distributing that information to required processing points.  Registration includes collecting, storing, and maintaining all information and documentation that is required for verifying and assuring the applicant’s identity. Various types of biometric (e.g., fingerprints, photographs) and source identity information (e.g., passport, driver’s license) are collected from the applicant at the time of registration. Minimum concepts associated with Registration include: a) an interface between geographically distributed workstations and the identity management system, b) a 10 slap finger print scanner, c) a document scanner, d) a digital camera, e) a card reader and f) a driver’s license reader/validator.  The registration function must interface with the identity management system to identify valid applicants and to store the applicants’ identity verification biometrics and data.  All data transferred between the registration service and the identity management system must take no more than 30 seconds across a T1 (1.54 mb) communications line.
3.2	Identity Management System (IDMS)
The identity management system (IDMS) is the secured data store for all applicant identity records. The IDMS performs the identity proofing, verification, and validation functions required to establish identity claim validity; holds and processes applicant status information; and ensures that all card issuance requirements are met prior to printing a card. The IDMS system extracts the primary and secondary finger prints and submits the 10 finger print slap to the Background Investigation facility (OPM, FBI) by accepted protocols.  In addition the IDMS interfaces with the card management system, registration systems, a variety of government systems for personnel management, enterprise-level physical access control systems, and enterprise-level logical access control systems. 

The respondent is requested to identify how an individual’s data can be securely protected with read/write permissions to data constrained by roles (sponsors, registrars, adjudicators, issuers) and by Agency (HHS, DOE, USDA, DHS, etc.)

3.3	Card/Credential Management System (CMS)
The card/credential management system tracks and manages the status of the PIV card throughout its entire lifecycle, including but not limited to the production-request, personal data record, activation, issuance, suspension, and revocation events.  Card operations and maintenance functions such as addressing lost cards, card malfunctions, card renewal, card reissue, applet updates, pin resets and other card “life cycle” functions should also be managed by the CMS.  

Special Publication 800-73 provides two PIV card specifications: an optional transition card specification (Part 2) and a mandatory endpoint card specification (Part 3). However, SP800-73 does not standardize card management interfaces. Proposed solutions should identify interoperability issues associated with the lack of standard PIV card management interfaces at the card level, and may provide observations and recommendations regarding PIV card management interface specifications.

Because smart cards issued by the CMS will remain in use for up to 5 years, a critical success factor in the project will be “avoidance of card holder confusion.”  Towards this goal, the respondent is requested to explain the process of a) updating of applets, PKI certificates and other information on the ICC, b) version control within the system, c) forgotten and regularly changing of PIN’s and d) other card life cycle functions.

The CMS interfaces with the IDMS, the PKI certification authority, and the card printing system, and must be capable of interacting with a variety of government systems for enterprise-level logical access control systems and physical access control systems in a secure manner.  Responses must identify how the security of the system will be managed.

3.4	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate Authority
The PKI Certification Authority function is responsible for the generation of key pairs, the issuance and distribution of digital certificates containing the public key of the cardholder, and management and dissemination of certificate status information. This function is used throughout the life cycle of PIV Cards, from generation and loading of authentication keys and PKI credentials, to usage of these keys for secure operations, to eventual renewal, reassurance, or termination of the card. The function is also responsible for the provisioning of publicly accessible repositories and services (such as PKI directories and certificate status responders) that provide information to the requesting application about the status of the PKI credentials. The PKI Certification Authority interacts with the CMS.

In all HSPD-12 deployments, the PKI certificate service requirements are provided in one of two ways:
·	Approved PKI Certification Authorities as members of the Federal PKI that are cross-certified with the Federal Bridge Certificate Authority (these enterprise domains can be found at http://cio.gov/fbca).
·	PKI Shared Service Providers that are approved to provide Federal PKI services under the Federal PKI Common Policy (these PKI Shared Service Providers can be found at http://cio.gov.ficc).

3.5	Card Printing System (CPS)
The card printing system covers card printing and distribution.  These functions include personalization of the physical (visual surface) and logical (contents of the ICC chip) aspects of the card at the time of card personalization.  The CPS is also responsible for all card production activities, including; maintaining control over the card stock, printing and personalizing the PIV card, logging and auditing of the print events, and distribution of the PIV Cards to the respective agency contact. 

3.6	Exclusions
For the purpose of this RFI, the five components above are considered the “HSPD-12 core system.”  The personnel management systems (for employees, affiliates, or contractors), the background investigation system, physical access control systems and logical access control systems identified in Figure 1 will most likely be addressed by individual Departments and are not to be addressed in this RFI except for explaining data interfaces between the solution and these components.

4.0	TURNKEY SERVICE SOLUTIONS
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial vendors to provide systems’ solutions that will meet the implementation requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12.  Specifically GSA is seeking information on the capability of commercial vendors to deploy, operate, and maintain system solutions that provide one or more of the following core components for HSPD-12 systems 
·	Registration system/services;
·	Identity Management System/services;
·	Card Management System/services;
·	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certification Authority Services
·	Card Printing System/services

Respondents are requested to explain the availability and responsiveness of a help desk, accessible to a limited number of Federal persons (possibly persons limited to Department-specific help desks).

Respondents are requested to provide explanations concerning the interfaces to the system components on the architecture diagram that are not provided as part of the proposed solution.

5.0	HSPD-12 CORE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The respondent is requested to comment on the practicality and validity of the following metrics:
·	Card printing and distribution within 24 hours after the workflow indicates permission to print the card.
·	Notification of suspension or revocation to a PACS and LACS interface within 20 minutes from notification to the system.
·	Following the issuance and 1:1 biometric verification, activation of the card within 5 minutes.
·	Enrollment (registration) time per applicant within 15 minutes.
·	Systems are scalable in terms of number of transactions per day and number of records, to meet the federal government’s growth needs.
·	Each component of the proposed solution shall have an uptime requirement of 99.9% measured on a monthly basis (no more than 43 minutes per month unplanned outage)
·	Help Desk services shall be available to limited Department-level help desks for assistance with system availability, performance and card-printing status.  Human availability and response to help desk requests shall be within 5 minutes of a phone call.

Respondents are encouraged to provide additional metrics on other aspects of the deployment of one or more HSPD-12 system components.  

6.0	ESTIMATE OF COSTS
The respondent is requested to identify a 5 year estimate of costs based on “number of cards issued” for 100,000 cardholders, 250,000 cardholders, 500,000 cardholders and > 1 million cardholders (initial year and four (4) years of O&M).  Other formulations and pricing models may be proposed.

7.0	SECURITY
The respondent is requested to explain the strategy for providing system and physical security for the provided service.
8.0	OTHER INFORMATION SOUGHT
In addition, respondents are encouraged to address the following issues:
Should the government specify interfaces between functional components or will interoperability be defined by industry?
What is the industry’s capacity to provide the identified system components as an integrated solution to one or more federal enterprises?
What is the industry’s capacity to provide multiple enterprise-wide solutions simultaneously to meet government-wide implementation timeframe of October 2006? 	

9.0 	RESPONDENT INFORMATION SOUGHT

OFFADD: U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command, Attn: AMSFS-CCA-M, Bldg 350, 6th floor, Rock Island, IL 61299-6000. SUBJECT: MARINE LOCATION MARKERS, MK 58-SERIES AND MK 25 SERIES DUE: 1/12/06  POC:  Julie Coughlin, julie.coughlin@us.army.mil, (309) 782-6139 or Jason Brunsvold, jason.brunsvold@us.army.mil, (309) 782-5081 The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Marine Location Marker (MLM), MK 58 Modifications 1, NSN 1370-01-074-0591, DODIC L580 and/or the Marine Location Marker (MLM) MK 25, Modifications 3 (NSN 1370-00-690 -1458, DODIC L554) and/or Modifications 5 (NSN 1370-01-387-7296, DODIC L168). The markers are launched from aircraft in either day or night to provide visual marks on the oceans surface. They may be used to mark the course of enemy submarines during an ASW (Antisubmarine Warfare) mission or a survivor in the water during SAR (Searc h And Rescue) missions. Markers may be launched from high-speed aircraft or helicopters, and surface ships. They can be used for any type of air to sea surface marking that are referenced by smoke and flame. The Mk 58 Mod 1 Marine Location Marker consists of a cylindrical tin can approximately 21.78 inches long and 5.00 inches in diameter. The can contains two pyrotechnic candles containing 1000 grams and 870 grams of a red phosphorus composition. The can is s trengthened and the candles are supported by foamed-in-place polyurethane. The ignition end of the marker has three holes, two for smoke and flame emission, and one for entry of water to the Mk 72 Mod 1 Water Activated Battery. Adhesive foil discs hermetic ally seal the two emission holes and a reinforced adhesive foil strip with a rectangular pull ring hermetically seals the battery cavity hole. The adhesive foil seals are protected during handling and shipping by a replaceable polyethylene protective cover . The marker contains a battery, squib, starter mix, two pyrotechnic candles, and a transfer fuse between the two candles. It is armed by removal of adhesive backed metallic foil strip (tear tape). The marker is activated upon entry into seawater with wate r entering the water port to activate the battery. Battery current energizes the electric squib, which ignites the starter mix, which in turn, lights the pyrotechnic candle. The first candle burns for a minimum of 20  minutes and then initiates the second candle by the use of the transfer fuse. The complete marker produces a continuous yellow flame and white smoke for a burn time of approximately 40 to 60 minutes. The MK25 Mod 3 marker consists of a cylindrical outer tube approximately 18.5 inches long and 3.0 inches in diameter. There is a projecting chimney at its nose end into which is fitted a valve assembly. At the opposite end is a heavier aluminum base assemb ly to which the outer tube is crimped. Within the base assembly is a Mk 72 Mod 1 Water-Activated Battery . The battery is shielded from water contact by two plugs which are fitted into 1/2 inch holes on two opposite sides of the base assembly. A ring ridge d cover (arming plate), held in place by a retainer ring, is recessed into the base end. An arrow in the center of the arming plate indicates its safe or armed position. The words Safe and Armed are stamped into the base rim, and a notch has been cut i nto the rim at the armed position to facilitate nighttime use. A black rubber G-ring, which serves as a gas check in pneumatic dispensing, encircles the base assembly approximately 1/4 inch from the crimp holding the outer case. Burning time ranges from 13 .5 to 18.5 minutes. Though designed for salt water use this item can be used in fresh water by insertion of salt tab lets. The Mk 25 Mod 5 marker consists of an aluminum body, approximately 19.0 inches long and 3.0 inches in diameter.  There is a projecting chimney at its nose end into which is fitted a valve assembly.  The opposite end is a heavier aluminum base assembly to w hich the outer tube is crimped.  Within the base assembly is a MK 72 Mod 0 water-activated battery.  The battery and battery cavity are shielded from water contact by an arming-safing assembly.  The arming-safing assembly consists of an arming cap attached  to a spring and sealing cup with an o-ring.  The arming cap features three equally spaced retaining slots.  The words SAFE (green letters) and ARM (red letters) are on opposite sides of each retaining slot.  The arming-safing assembly and base are protect ed by a threaded, plastic protective cover.  The marker contains a water-soluble scuttle element and three 0.013 diameter flood holes to assure that the marker will scuttle and sink within 3 to 12 hours after water impact or 1 to 3 hours after ignition. A respondent must have personnel trained, skilled, and experienced in handling Red Phosphorous (RP) compositions that are extremely flammable and environmentally sensitive. Specialized formulation skills are necessary to meet precise burn time ranges requi red for the MK 58 and MK25s. The government expects to procure approximately 8,000 MK58 Markers and approximately 8000 MK25 Markers per year based on current budget estimates. Information provided to the government will be used to aid in the development of an acquisition strategy for the MK58 and MK25 MLM and does not constitute any commitment on the part of the government. The government intends to award these two items within a single contract. Interested parties should contact the government POC for top level drawings and questionnaire. In addition to the questionnaire the following data is requested: * An approximation of minimum quantities required per order to sustain production capacity. * An approximation of minimum quantities required to be ordered by the government to consider bidding. Include required minimum reorder quantity in option years of a contract to sustain contractor participation. * Degree of interest towards an award of the two items in a single contract. If no interest in this type of an award, which item is more lucrative, and why.  * Supporting documentation(ex. Pictures, brochures, etc.).

SECTION B – SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS

This solicitation is for the selection of a central laboratory to perform SMN mRNA assays for two Phase I/IIa trials of phenylbutyrate in the treatment of pediatric subjects with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  These studies will be performed under a prime contract, HHSN265200423611C, NO: NO1-NS-4-2361, NINDS Pilot Therapeutic Trials Network (NPTUNE), which Westat holds with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).  The selected laboratory will provide services as a subcontractor to Westat.  The subcontract that is established will incorporate the required clauses from Westat’s prime contract and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) as delineated in Attachment 5.  A full text of some of these FAR clauses is also provided.  A full text of any clause that will be incorporated by reference may be accessed electronically at this address:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/

A maximum of 42 subjects will be enrolled and followed in the two studies. Specimens will be batch-shipped at intervals throughout the studies to the selected laboratory for SMN mRNA testing.  The exact number of specimens to be analyzed will depend on the final protocol sampling requirements and on the number of subjects required to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in the dose-escalation stage of the protocols.  We estimate a maximum of 200 samples will be collected for SMN mRNA analysis by the selected laboratory. 

Pricing for the subcontract will be a Fixed Unit Price per assay performed.  The computation and documentation of all proposed pricing must be contained in the Offeror’s business proposal (Section D).

	
SECTION C – STATEMENT OF WORK

BRIEF BACKGROUND FOR NPTUNE

The NINDS has established NPTUNE to facilitate the rapid conduct of high quality clinical trials and research through the provision of infrastructure for the design and implementation of pilot studies, primarily Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, in a timely and efficient manner.  Westat, a research organization located in Rockville, Maryland, is under contract with the NINDS to serve as the Clinical Operations Center (COC) for NPTUNE.  Westat will assist the NINDS with investigative site selection, assemble protocol development teams, provide training and site monitoring, provide data management expertise, facilitate investigator meetings, perform data analysis, and provide other clinical operations support services as may be required.


STUDY SPECIFIC INFORMATION

Brief Study Background

The first clinical trials to be conducted under NPTUNE are two Phase I/IIa dose escalation studies of phenylbutyrate in the treatment of pediatric subjects with SMA. SMA is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord resulting in diffuse weakness and muscular atrophy. SMA is one of the most common pediatric neuromuscular conditions, with an incidence of 1 in 6,000 – 10,000 live births, and is a leading cause of hereditary infant mortality. Symptoms most frequently present in infancy and early childhood, but the clinical spectrum of onset and severity is broad.  The classification of SMA is based on age at onset and severity of disease course.  Patients with Type I SMA (Werdnig-Hoffman disease), usually show clinical signs by three months and cannot sit unaided. Type II typically presents before 18 months of age, and patients cannot stand or walk unaided.  Onset of SMA Type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease) is after 18 months of age and patients typically reach all motor milestones.

At this time, there is no known pharmacological treatment for SMA.  However, several compounds have been identified that appear to up-regulate SMN gene expression or alter gene splicing to produce an increased ratio of full-length SMN to exon-7-deleted (SMN&#61508;7) mRNA. Some of these compounds are readily available for use in subjects and have a proven safety record in the treatment of other disorders. The purpose of the two planned studies is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of phenylbutyrate as well as to evaluate the effects of this drug on SMN mRNA and protein levels in subjects with SMA. The protocol for the two studies will be very similar, with the exceptions of eligibility criteria and frequency of specimen collection.  

The protocols for these studies are not yet finalized, and the selected laboratory may be asked to review and provide input as appropriate.  The current protocol design is briefly described below but the final approved protocols may vary from that presented here.

Design

The SMA Type I protocol will be conducted in subjects under 2 years of age, and the SMA Type II/III protocol will be conducted in children ages 2 to 12 years. The SMA Type II/III study is expected to begin enrollment first in order to establish an effective time course of SMN mRNA blood draws.  Data from the SMN mRNA analysis on the first subjects enrolled in the SMA Type II/III protocol will be used to determine the blood draw schedule for the SMA Type I protocol. 
The primary objective for these studies is to select the “best dose” based on safety endpoints.  These studies will assess safety, MTD, and the pharmacokinetics of phenylbutyrate in these populations, as well as cellular response by measure of specific biomarkers. 

Each protocol will have two stages. Stage 1 is a dose-escalating stage where subjects will be enrolled sequentially into escalating dose cohorts of three subjects each.  They will remain on drug for 30 days and will then be followed for a two week period once off study drug.  Stage 2 will enroll six subjects at the MTD as identified in Stage 1.  These subjects will receive study drug for three months and will then be followed for a two week period once off study medication.  

It is expected that each study will be completed in approximately one year.  Multiple clinical sites will be selected to complete the required enrollment in each protocol.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The selected central laboratory will be required to perform the appropriate assays to measure the relative units of both full-length SMN mRNA and SMN&#61508;7 mRNA (exon 7 deleted) transcripts in blood specimens.  The laboratory will be required to perform the assays and provide the results in an Excel file for electronic export to the NPTUNE Data Management Center at Westat within two weeks of receiving specimens for analysis.  Westat staff will work with the laboratory staff to ensure the Excel reporting format is acceptable for import into the Westat database.  Test data transfers will be required and will be coordinated by appropriate Westat staff prior to initial data transfer. 

Specimens will be obtained from study subjects, processed, stored at and shipped from the clinical sites in accordance with the procedures required by the central laboratory. Specimens will be shipped to the central laboratory from each site when all samples for a subject have been collected.  The central laboratory will be required to coordinate specimen shipping with the clinical sites and will be responsible for appropriately receiving, accessioning, processing, storing and tracking use, integrity and security of specimens received. 

The SMN mRNA central laboratory will be responsible for providing sufficient staff with appropriate training and experience to ensure proper execution of the assays according to written laboratory Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), applicable federal, state and local regulatory requirements and industry standards for good laboratory practices.  Laboratory facilities and equipment must be sufficient and appropriate to successfully support the assays being performed.  The laboratory must record, collect and maintain all source documentation necessary to allow verification of assay performance, quality control, intermediate and final data. 
The laboratory will be responsible for ensuring the integrity and security of the study specimens while at the laboratory, as well as tracking of specimen use.  At the conclusion of the study, the laboratory will be responsible for providing Westat a copy of the tracking records for all study specimens received at the laboratory, including date of use, reason for use (assay) and volume used.  The lab will be required to secure and retain all unused study specimens until instructions for final specimen disposition are provided by Westat.
Study specimens are not to be used for any purpose other than that specified here unless instructed in writing by Westat.  All data generated from the testing and analysis of these study specimens is the property of NINDS and may not be used or reported, except to Westat, without prior written approval from Westat.  It is anticipated the primary research investigator(s) will be appropriately recognized, e.g., authorship.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intent to renew Birth Verification Services
<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to renew sole-source agreements to obtain detailed and complete birth record information through State agencies throughout the Country.  The process by which the information is obtained and the information itself is intergraded into a unique investigative database in a secure environment.  Additionally, the program research has determined that the States provide birth record data with substantially greater accuracy and detail than third party vendors do.  The information is utilized in analyzing investigative information for security and suitability adjudication.  Therefore, the States are the intended source for these services. OPM FISD deems it appropriate to award fixed-price agreements on other than a full and open competitive basis to the State authorities. The State authorities are the available responsible sources and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Agency. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 519120 - Libraries and Archives. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a solicitation for offers but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate sole source awards to various State  public health agencies. This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.

1.  Provides continuing guidance to USAID/W and field personnel on new and established Agency and Bureau policy and procedures on program development and implementation.  Monitors developments associated with U.S. assistance to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Facilitates release of funds to these countries. Represents the Missions and interprets their positions on issues, problems, and programs.

3.   Prepares narrative and statistical descriptions and analyses on the status of activities in desk countries for Bureau, Agency, State, OMB, and Congressional reviews and presentations; prepares briefing papers and Congressional testimony. 

4. In collaboration with the Bureau's Program Office, assesses progress in achieving Bureau strategic objectives, particularly in the Caucasus region. Recommend modifications of the Mission’s approach, if necessary.

•	Comprehensive knowledge of USAID's country program strategy and planning systems, with particular reference to FREEDOM Support Act requirements, as well as a thorough working knowledge of the Agency’s project design and implementation systems.

•	Thorough working knowledge of U.S. foreign aid legislation and trends and Executive Branch policies and directions.

•	Knowledge of relevant economic and social issues of assigned countries.

•	Solid knowledge of USAID management systems and administrative procedures.

•	Strong skill in adapting analytical techniques and evaluation criteria to the identification, consideration, and resolution of issues and problems of a procedural and factual nature.

•	Strong skill in conducting interviews with supervisors and employees to obtain information about organizational missions, functions and work procedures.

*Note – PSCs may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a US Direct Hire employee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS

Under the supervision and policy direction of the Office Director, the incumbent has a degree of independence to act within overall Agency and Bureau policies and objectives and is held accountable for timeliness and quality of finished products.  The incumbent coordinates and monitors Caucasus programs both at the policy/strategy level and on a daily basis. The supervisor furnishes advice and guidance in problem cases, reviews work products for technical adequacy and conformance to policy, and evaluates overall effectiveness in terms of contributions to established goals.  The employee plans, coordinates, and carries out the successive steps in accordance with accepted office policies, applicable precedents, organizational concepts, management theory, and occupational training.  


GUIDELINES

Guidelines include laws and legislative initiatives, Agency rules and regulations, US government foreign and domestic policy directives, country-specific policies, and strategy and program planning issues, which are subject to interpretation.  Incumbent is expected to use independent judgment in determining the application of current foreign assistance legislative provisions and executive policies to assigned responsibilities. The employee must use independent judgment in researching regulations and in determining the relationship between guidelines and organizational efficiency, program effectiveness, or employee productivity.


COMPLEXITY

Work includes technical analysis, particularly economic policy review, country strategy formulation, project proposal analysis and program implementation review. The necessary analytical role requires awareness of U.S. Government political complexities and changing host country circumstances.  Tasks often require departing from past approaches and dealing with unstructured circumstances. Task objectives may depend on an assessment of competing demands.  Experienced judgment is needed to provide appropriate advice for E&E management. The myriad pressures for access to the program and decision-makers create an unusual combination of technical, administrative and policy issues at all times. 





SCOPE AND EFFECT

The expertise provided by the incumbent contributes to Mission analysis and identification of the key economic and social problems in the Caucasus region.  His or her input helps to define what is appropriate for USAID’s attention and guides the development of strategic and project approaches.  Such input keeps the Mission abreast of Washington agencies’ views of the region. The incumbent's findings and recommendations are vetted with the Office Director and senior E&E management.  These findings and recommendations heavily influence the position that the Agency takes regarding program strategy, composition and funding.


PERSONAL CONTACTS

Incumbent maintains close contact with appropriate staff in the field, the E&E Bureau, and central bureaus, in particular Global and Legislative and Public Affairs.  Outside contacts are with staff of the State Department Office of the Coordinator for U.S. Assistance for Europe and Eurasia, and other State Department offices and bureaus.  The incumbent will also have frequent contact with high government officials, host country representatives and NGO's.  Host country embassy contacts are often at the ministerial level and include ambassadors.  Frequent contacts are also made with the IMF and World Bank officers in charge of specific country programs for these institutions.  Public contacts are extensive, and may include association leaders, corporate officers, lobbyists, diaspora group members, university representatives, and non-profit foundation executives.


PURPOSE OF CONTACTS

The purpose of contacts is to cooperate with colleagues and counterparts to assure the completion of necessary actions, to advocate specific positions and to explain and/or justify U.S. Government policy position.  Contacts typically involve such matters as: identification of decision-making alternatives; appraisals of success in meeting goals; and recommendations for resolving problems. Incumbent must be skilled in negotiating and presenting policy/strategy options and in effecting a consensus on solutions.


PHYSCIAL DEMANDS

The work is essentially sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.




WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is performed in an office setting.  Occasional requirements for field trips could expose the incumbent to disease, challenging work conditions, and security risks. 

SUPERVISION/OVERSIGHT OF OTHERS

Incumbent provides guidance to two Caucasus Region desk officers.  One is responsible for Georgia and Azerbaijan.  The other desk officer is responsible for Armenia.  As a Team Leader, the incumbent’s leadership, technical and program management skills coupled with hands-on experience are important to ensure that the desk officers can perform their functions in a highly efficient and knowledgeable manner.  The incumbent is responsible for offering timely feedback to the Office Director regarding the desk officers’ performance.

<DESC>Amendment Two (2) to RFQ SAQMPD06Q1006   (Additional Questions and Answers)

1.	Question:  What is considered to be “substantial knowledge of the U.S. Department of State, in particular, its diversity recruitment efforts?
Does this mean practical “working knowledge” of or specific knowledge derived from having worked with your agency or other federal agencies on recruitment programs?

Answer:  Knowledge from having worked with State in the past would be preferred, but work with other federal agencies on employment recruitment would be considered.

2.	Question:  As referenced, our consultants have worked on numerous federal efforts, however, neither has dealt with recruitment or anything similar.
As such, are we precluded from submitting a proposal based on our lack of interaction with federal agencies in areas referenced in the RFQ or would our established federal experience suffice?  

Answer:  You would not be precluded, but knowledge of employment recruitment is preferred.

3.	Question:  If we prepare a proposal and have zero federal references, would we even be taken into consideration?

Answer:  References from federal customers are required.
