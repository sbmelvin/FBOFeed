Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies acquiring Electronics and information Technology (EIT) to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.  All EIT procured under this contract/order must met the following 36 CFR 1194 accessibility standards.  The full text of the accessibility standards is available at:  http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm, _X_ 1194.21 - Software Applications and Operating Systems, ___1194.22 - Web Based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, ___1194.23 - Telecommunications Products, ___ 1194.24 - Video and Multimedia Products, ___ 1194.25 - Self-Contained, Closed Products, _X_1194.26 - Desktop and Portable Computers, ___ 1194.31 - Functional Performance Criteria.  The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology devise(s), but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and device(s) so that it can be made accessible if so required in the future.  Contractors may propose products or services that result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use by individuals with disabilities; this is known as equivalent facilitation.

All information technology provided under, or in support of, this contract by the contractor and all subcontractors shall be Year 2000 compliant.  "Year 2000 compliant" means, with respect to information technology, that the information technology accurately processes date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing, and sequencing) from, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000 and leap year calculations, to the extent that other information technology, used in combination with the information technology being acquired, properly exchanges date/time data with it.  To ensure Year 2000 compliance, the contractor shall, at a minimum, test a representative sampling of the information technology, or the same type of information technology, that will be provided under the contract.  Year 2000 Compliance testing will be accomplished and documented in accordance with generally accepted commercial standards/practices.  If requested, the contractor shall provide the Government with a copy of such Year 2000 compliance test documentation at no additional cost to the Government.

<DESC>SUBJECT?NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS
DESC: The General Services Administration intends award a sole source contract to Aydin Displays, Incorporated, 700 Dresher Road, Horsham, PA 19044 for the P/N 356-7005-502 Standard rugged Flat Panel Monitor/Display with the following required components and features which are specifically configured for full compatibility with the ships? MIL-C-49142/3 three-lug cable connectors: (1) standard nineteen-inch equipment rack mount; (2) fourteen-inch panel height; (3) integral safety glass viewing window; (4) video input connector. Aydin Displays, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of this equipment and it has been successfully integrated and is presently in operation in other Navy ships. Aydin Displays, Inc. is the only manufacturer that has the proprietary information, capabilities, and knowledge to manufacture this equipment. Theses units are identical to ones previously installed in other Navy ships and shall maintain the established configuration baseline. Any other manufactured units would impact the operator, maintainer and the established logistics support structure and would require new engineering analysis and testing. And unnecessarily increase both technical and schedule risk and ultimately raise program costs. The commonality of systems is critical in maintaining a baseline ship configuration in the fleet. This contract action is subject to the availability of funds. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

Delivery is set for FY05 through FY08 with a delivery of 190 units per year.  The first deliveries will commence 12 months after the order is placed.  Ordering shall begin in January 04 and continue through December 07.  The LRU must be qualified to the current standards and specifications prior to delivery. Intended source is Raytheon Systems Company, El Segundo, CA.  Raytheon Systems Company is the sole manufacturer of MAGR2000s and is the only known company capable of providing the production requirement within the specified time period.
STATEMENTS OF CAPABILITY/TEAMING PLANS:  Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC), which includes the following information: a technical description of the GPS Receiver sufficient for a government evaluation of the system as equivalent to MAGR2000 system.

DECLARATION: This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP), government sponsorship of contractor charges against any government contract for proposal efforts, or a government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.  If no responses are received by 19 April 2002, to the effect that a comparable source is available, a modification will be issued to the current contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-02-00216, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-06.  The  associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 which has a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, it is anticipated that the contract will be awarded as a result of full and open competition. The purpose of this notice is to inform all interested  parties that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC  intends to award a Firm-fixed-price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  Award will be made to a single contractor for all analyses.  The primary focuses of this  procurement requires the contractor 1)  to prepare the Fluid Modeling Facility's Meteorological Wind Tunnel and all of it's associated flow and concentration instrumentation for a scale model study of the flow and concentration fields in lower Manhattan with tracers emitted from the World Trade Center Site and 2) to design, prepare, and  execute a series of plume experiments in the Fluid Modeling Facility's Convection Laboratory including preparation and testing of all the instrumentation within the Convection Lab. The performance period is fourteen months from date of award. All equipment and supplies required to perform this work  will be provided by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Approximately 75% of the work to be performed under this contract will, by necessity, occur on site at the EPA's Fluid Modeling Facility (FMF) in Research Triangle Park, NC.  The work to be performed under this contract, which is expected to  occur over fourteen months, shall include the following tasks: 1) The contractor shall participate in the World Trade Center (WTC) study design with responsibility for: a) examining the climatological data together with expertise in the flow in and around complex building arrays to determine  important wind directions for fully characterizing the flow-field throughout the urban model in the wind tunnel; b) determining the capabilities and limitations of the flow and turbulence instrumentation (LDV, pulsed-wire, and hot-wire anemometry) as they relate to the selection of practical  locations within the model street canyons for characterization of the flow field; c) customizing the hydrocarbon analysis system (with the automated range switching system) for collecting concentrations at up to 120 fixed locations and many more variable locations and recommending specific  concentration measurement locations to optimize identification of the distribution of concentrations (particularly the likely areas of highest concentration) throughout the urban model; and d) based on experience with laboratory flow measurements in and around multiple buildings recommending the  tunnel speeds and scale for the model that will allow the concentration and flow measurements to be accomplished without violating similarity scaling limits (e.g. building and roughness critical Reynolds numbers, etc).  The contractor shall meet weekly (and additionally as issues or problems arise)  with the project officer and the remaining EPA collaborators to discuss the progress of this and all the tasks of this contract work.  Concise summary of recommendations and work performed under this task shall be provided by the contractor as a deliverable for this task. 2) The contractor shall  prepare and test the Meteorological Wind Tunnel to be ready to accept the WTC scale model.  This includes: a) certification of the test-section velocity controls; b) testing for the proper operation of instrument carriage and computer controls with specific attention to the testing and repair (as  needed) of the BCC52 Imbedded Computer for the carriage controls unit; c) reprogramming wind-tunnel data acquisition and control software (as needed); d) repair and replace (as needed) any of the wind tunnel hardware (i.e. data acquisition system); e)  test, adjust and prepare the wind tunnel  ceiling adjustment system; f) examine the wind tunnel test section for integrity (repair as needed); g) install spires and roughness elements to produce an upstream (of test section) turbulent boundary layer with specifications provided by project officer; h) repair the Scani valve in the  concentration sampling system.  Concise summary of the work performed under this task shall be provided by the contractor as a deliverable for this task. 3) The contractor shall prepare, calibrate and test the flow, turbulence, and concentration instrumentation for the Meteorological Wind Tunnel.   The instruments (and their supporting data acquisition and analysis hardware and software) include: the laser doppler velocimeter, the pulsed-wire anemometer, the hot wire anemometer, the pitot tube anememometer (with MKS brand barometer), the hydorcarbon (flame ionization detector) analyzers (with  custom automated range switching system), the overall data acquisition system including statistical analysis of turbulent velocites.  The contractor shall modify the carriage system in the wind tunnel to accommodate rakes of concentration probes.  Concise summary of the work performed under this  task shall be provided by the contractor as a deliverable for this task. 4)  The contractor shall design and implement a methodology for applying the laser-doppler-velocimeter system in the meteorological wind tunnel.   Specifically, the LDV system will be configured to provide three-component  turbulent velocities at selected locations within the selected scale model of lower Manhattan (actual measurements will be conducted by FMF personnel upon completion of this task).  This requires a mobile support system for the probe (head) of the anemometer to allow frequent movement with accurate  positioning of the sampling volume to quickly obtain profiles of velocity components at a number of specified horizontal locations.  Concise summary of the work performed under this task shall be provided by the contractor as a deliverable for this task. 5) The contractor shall design, configure  and conduct testing of the FMF Convection Laboratory to prepare it for sampling of simulated plume releases for scaled boundary layers and plume buoyancies as specified by the technical monitor.  This will include (but not limited to): configuring and testing the laser-induced florescence system  (laser and carriage system, scanner, mirrors, filters, cooling system,etc), calibrating and aligning the video data acquisition system (camera and carriage, digital frame grabber, related software), calibrating and testing the lab automation and syncroniztion system (including the computer control  of laser beam scanning, filter placement, convection tank heating, temperature sampling, source release and movement, laser/camera shychronization, frame grabbing and storage), testing of the convection tank recirulation and cooling system, and testing of boundary layer and convection generation  system (temperature profiling system, electrically heated surface system).   This includes demonstration of the successful acquisition of plume dispersion data using in-house analysis software.  Problems with design and instrumentation shall be diagnosed and corrected as needed.  The contractor  will examine the convection tank for structural, electrical, and mechanical integrety, diagnose and correct any problems.  Concise summary of the work performed under this task shall be provided by the contractor as a deliverable for this task. 6) The contractor shall conduct a series of  approximately 40 plume experiments with plume buoyancies and boundary layers established according to specification provided by the project officer.  Throughout the experiments, the contractor shall  diagnose operational problems with the measurement system and provide repair of malfunctioning  systems.  The raw data collected under this task shall be provide by the contractor on compact disc as a deliverable for this task. 7) The contractor (using software available at EPA) shall analyze the individual experimental data and provide a summary of the data in each case with all the data  files placed on compact disc.  This will include an examination of plume statistics, computation of ensemble statistics over multiple repeated cases, and delivery of raw and processed data to EPA project officer. 8) The contractor shall provide a complete written data report of the experiments  including a description of the experimental design, an overview of the results with extensive graphical display, an summary and analysis of problems (and solutions) encountered and a compendium of the data on compact disc.

<DESC>The Respiratory Diseases Branch, Tuberculosis, Leprosy and other Mycobacterial Diseases Program and the Bacteriology and Mycology Branch, Mycology Program of the Division of, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, have a requirement to establish contract resources for the development of animal models in tuberculosis and invasive aspergillosis that are suitable to validate potential targets for drug, diagnostic and vaccine development. For tuberculosis, these models shall allow rapid throughput evaluation of the in vivo role of gene products and shall be made available as a service to the community. For  invasive aspergillosis, contract resources are required to: standardize animal models of infection; develop a means for  reliable quantification of infectious burden; define surrogate markers of infection and disease progression; then utilize these models to address community-posed research questions. Together, these resources are to fill a critical gap in the path from genomic to translational research in tuberculosis and invasive aspergillosis.

It is anticipated that two (2) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded (one contract for each PART) for a period of seven (7) years, beginning approximately May 5, 2003. NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-09 will be available electronically on or about April 12, 2002, and may be accessed  through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/CMB Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/CMB Home Page.  Once at the NIAID/CMB Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on "RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-09."

Please note that the RFP has been revised to include only the Work Statement, Deliverable and Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and the Specific RFP Instructions and Provisions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is EME-2002-RQ-DO01 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $1.5 million in average annual receipts (see CBD numbered note 1).  The contract line item number (CLIN) for the required services is as follows:  CLIN 0001, OCGFC Re-Evaluation Report, 1, Lot.  This requirement is for a re-evaluation of the effect of the Cerro Grande fire on the real estate market in Los Alamos County for the Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims (OCGFC).  In May 2000, the Cerro Grande fire, which resulted from a prescribed burn at the Bandalier National Monument, burned over 47,000 acres in Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Santa Fe Counties.  The fire caused the loss of over 400 dwelling units in the City of Los Alamos.  The United States Government has accepted responsibility for damages caused by the fire.  In July 2000, Congress enacted the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act, Public Law 106-246.  The Act tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to compensate those who suffered personal injury, property, business and financial losses resulting from the fire.  The law specifically requires compensation for any decrease in the value of property resulting from the fire.  FEMA established the OCGFC to administer compensation of claimants who had losses resulting from the fire.  The Act, its resulting regulations and policy guidelines are available on the internet at http://www.fema.gov/cerrogrande.com

The approximately 18,000 claims filed with OCGFC include claims of individual homeowners who claim realized and unrealized losses in the value of their real property due to the fire and real estate developers who attribute their inability to sell lots and homes to the results of the fire.  In January 2001, the OCGFC contracted for a study to address the effect of the fire on the local economy in Los Alamos County, in particular the impact on the residential real estate market.  The study provided under the contract, entitled ?Economic Study of the Los Alamos Post-Fire Residential Real Estate Market, March 28, 2001? included an assessment on whether or not the properties experienced diminution or a devaluation of their value, and if so, to what extent.  This report is available for review at the aforementioned internet address.  This study was based on interviews with realtors, appraisers, homeowners, and bankers, sought input from the community and reviewed pre- and post-fire real estate listing and sales data through January 31, 2001.  The report was made public on March 28, 2001, and indicated that certain areas of Los Alamos County (those closest to the fire) were more affected by the fire than others.  Because there were no significant external factors that would significantly affect post-fire property values any significant post-fire diminution in residential property values was a result of the fire.  Percentages of diminution were assigned to communities relative to their proximity to the fire.  Based on the study and report, diminution guidelines and a calculator were developed in order to ensure fair and accurate compensation to claimants.   The OCGFC determined that it would be necessary to re-evaluate the market to determine if a recovery has occurred.  The re-evaluation shall be completed by May 31, 2002, and incorporate all sales information from January 31, 2001 to present.  In order to meet this objective, the OCGFC now seeks quotations to review newly available data and compare it with the original material, including sales data, listing data, and current policy guidelines; conduct surveys; seek public input and comment as required in order to determine whether there is a change in the diminution of real estate values in Los Alamos County.  

The successful offeror shall be familiar with or develop an understanding of the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act, its implementing regulations and policies; the Los Alamos area and its history, including Los Alamos National Laboratory?s effect on the economy and real estate market; Los Alamos County residential development patterns; types of residential structures and new housing developments; the damage caused by the Cerro Grande fire; the original Economic Study of the Los Alamos Post-Fire Residential Real Estate Market, dated March 28, 2001 and its supporting data; and other data necessary to re-evaluate the real estate market as it exists today.  The successful offeror will be required to prepare a report and adjust the formulas used in the diminution calculator program. 

The resultant contract will include a not-to-exceed (NTE) amount of $25,000.00 for services to assist the OCGFC in the evaluation of claims, provide expert testimony in the context of mediations, appeals and arbitrations, and to discuss the methodologies and findings of the report with members of the public.  These additional services shall be provided on a time and material (T&M) basis based on work orders issued by the project officer.  Contract deliverables include a first draft of the re-evaluation report that shall be delivered no later than May 28, 2002.  The final report shall be delivered no later than May 31, 2002.   
The contractor shall make any necessary adjustments to the calculator formulas used to process these claims no later than June 3, 2002.  The entire period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2003.

The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforming to the solicitation is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation, Commercial Items.  The specific evaluation criteria include:  i) price, ii) demonstrated familiarity with the Los Alamos or New Mexico real estate market; and iii) experience and past performance conducting economic analysis or establishing economic trends and forecasts in New Mexico.

Quotations shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, Commercial Items.  The quotation shall also include a technical proposal addressing the evaluation factors specified above.  A fixed price shall be quoted for CLIN 0001 and fixed labor rates shall be quoted for the additional services that may be requested for evaluation of claims, expert testimony, and public meetings.  The technical and past performance evaluation factors, when combined, are slightly more important than price in importance.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders, Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816, is soliciting proposals for the Novel Intelligence from Massive Data (NIMD) program via Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NMA401-02-BAA-0004.  The BAA will be posted in its entirety on the following website:  www.nima.mil/poc/contracts/baa.html.  It is anticipated that multiple awards will be issued as a result of the BAA.  The program length is a minimum of 40 months and possesses a significant budget across the program's anticipated period of performance.  Questions can be directed via only e-mail to ACWEB1@nima.mil.  Questions should be submitted after review of the BAA and not from only reading this FEDBIZOPPS announcement.
	The BAA that is posted is a draft version.  It is anticipated that the final version will be released on or around 10 April 2002.  Since it is unlikely that there will be significant revisions between the draft and the final BAA, there is no intent to change any procurement schedule dates.
	The initial proposal submittal date is 11 Jun 2002 and the BAA closing date is 3 October 2002.  Please see the BAA for the detailed and definitive information regarding proposal submission date requirements.
	The following is a brief description of the program.
	The Novel Intelligence from Massive Data (NIMD) program is aimed at focusing analytic attention on the most critical information found within massive data - information that indicates the potential for strategic surprise.  In this context, Novel Intelligence is defined as actionable information not previously known to the analyst or policy makers.  It gives the analyst new insight into a previously unappreciated or misunderstood threat.
	The BAA is interested in research in 5 areas: (1) Modeling analysts and analytic processes; (2) Recognizing, representing, and using prior and tacit knowledge; (3) Generating, representing and tracking multiple scenarios, hypotheses, and/or strategies; (4) Massive data structuring/organization, normalization, ingest, and analysis; and (5) Methods for human information interaction.  
	Novel intelligence is likely to result from recognizing the assumptions, biases, and hypotheses that drive an analysis and systematically helping analysts challenge or extend them. Ultimately, the most powerful analytic environment will be one in which information about analysts is not only induced from their activities, but in which they also have an active hand in explicitly constructing and manipulating representations or models of the analytic targets that contain and make explicit their knowledge, interests, hypotheses and biases, and other traits of their analytic state.  NIMD encourages research in two directions simultaneously: developing techniques and tools that assist analysts both in dealing with massive data and in interactively making explicit, modifying and updating their current analytic state, including their hypotheses, knowledge, interests, and biases; and developing techniques and tools that infer the state of analysts and the analytic process from analysts' activities as recorded through an instrumented environment.   
	Key abilities of NIMD-enabled systems are to identify structures within massive data, to generate novel and plausible explanations for those structures, and then to communicate these findings to analysts in ways that support further investigation.
	Having developed the structures and explanations, a NIMD-enabled system will help analysts evaluate them and track their plausibility as events unfold - gathering and tracking evidence related to multiple chains of reasoning, making it easy to recognize and simultaneously evaluate multiple alternatives objectively.  In particular, the system will alert analysts when a less-attended candidate becomes more deserving of attention.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SEE NUMBERED NOTE 22.   The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to enter into negotiations with the International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) for the purpose of creating a standardized nutrient database.  The standardized nutrient database will consist of all frequently consumed foods reported on 24-hour dietary recalls in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a 10 country prospective epidemiologic study being conducted in Europe. The NCI and the EPIC have been collaborating on methodological studies regarding measurement errors and pooled data analysis.  These data indicate the there is a substantial measurement error in assessing nitrogen intake in country-specific Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) which may not be adequately evaluated using the EPIC reference instrument (24-hour dietary recalls).  This database will provide accurate, standardized nutrient data to help assess the relationship between diet and cancer as well to assess the extent of dietary measurement error, a topic of great interest at NCI.  The IARC is the only agency that can perform the tasks necessary to create the standardized nutrient database inasmuch as the EPIC data belong to both the IARC and participating countries and are not publicly available. IARC is the coordinating center for these data and will have the responsibility for overseeing and conducting developing the standardized nutrient database. The anticipated award date for this sole source acquisition is September 2002 for a period of one year.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a) 2.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to address the following clarification and questions for the specifications provided for this solicitation:  

1) On the data sheet for ROV-4001

	Please clarify note (3). Please clarify the 500psi dp requirement, also clarify the inlet side 1000 psi requirement.  Closing against a full dp of 6000psi is understood.  For the open stroke time, at what pressure is this to be tested?

Response: 1) Clarifications for ROV-4001 - This valve will be used as a main shut-off valve for hydrocarbon fuel service.  It will be located at the outlet of a hydrocarbon fuel tank.   Normally, this valve will be opened and closed at less than 100 psi.  Once opened and the system brought to pressure, the valve must be capable of closing with a full DP of 6000 psi.  When the valve is closed and the tank is pressurized, the valve shall not be capable of being opened with pressure on the inlet side of 1000 or greater psi.    Ignore the DP of 500 psi requirement.  The open stroke time should be tested at 1000 psi.  

2) On the data sheet for ROV-4002

	Please clarify note (3).  A system description would be helpful.  Please clarify the type of position indicator requested for the limit switches, visual vs. 24V signal to a controller.

Response:  2) Clarifications for ROV-4002-- This valve will be used as a fill valve in a hydrocarbon fuel system.  It will normally be opened and closed during filling operations when the system pressure is around 100 psi or less.  Since the valve is connected to the a high pressure run system though, when it is closed the downstream (or outlet) side of the valve will be subjected to pressures of up to 6000 psi.  This drives the requirement that the actuator not be capable of opening the valve when the pressure on the outlet of the valve is 1000 psi or greater.  When the valve is opened, it should be capable of opening against a DP of 150 psi. Limit switches, indicating if the valve is full open or full closed, and as specified under section 3.2.7(2)(A) pg 8 of the specification should be provided--not a controller.  

3)  Regarding ROSS-1005 Specification we have the following questions:

	Page 5, paragraph 24,  Do you prefer the MS ports?
	Page 6, paragraph 5,  Do actuators have to be stainless steel or can they be painted carbon steel?
	Page 8, paragraph 2.  Can solenoids replace the Moog servo valves?
	Page 10 paragraph 3.3.2.  Do you require an acceptance test procedure for approval?
	page 11, top paragraph.  Is the requirement for the 100ft of Belden plenum cable 89418 necessary?  We have not done this test like this in the past but are willing to do this if necessary.

Response:  3)(a)We prefer the MS ports.
	(b)Actuators can be painted carbon steel.
	(c)You should plan to use the solenoid valves.
	(d)We did not specifically request the acceptance test procedure be submitted and approved.   However, if the Contractor would like us to review and approve their test procedure we would be happy to do so.
	(e)The requirement for the 100 ft of Belden plenue cable is necessary.  This is to more closely simulate the length of cable that will actually be connected to the valve in the field, and will therefore more closely simulate actual field conditions during testing.  

No further changes indicated.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to identify the quantity of work ordered in the last two years.  In fiscal year 2001 there were approximately 228 review days, and in fiscal year 2002 there were requests for approximately 466 review days.  This combined synopsis/solicitation does not include any additional changes.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number RFQ DG133F-02-RQ-0007 is issued as a request for quotations. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. This procurement action is full and open. The associated North America Industry Classification System is 541710.   A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if it size standard is 500 employees.  A list of contract line item numbers and items, quantities and units of measure include:  CLIN 0001A, Year One, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001B, Year Two, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001C, Year Three, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001D, Year Four, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001E, Year Five, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day.  
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires a Center of Independent Experts (CIE) with the requisite technical and scientific expertise to provide impartial and comprehensive comments and practical advice through outside peer reviews on scientific issues related to the living marine resource management mandates of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Subjects for reviews may include: stock assessments and population modeling methods for fish, marine mammals, or sea turtles; field sampling procedures or protocols; and review of existing and/or design of new scientific programs or management strategies. The CIE shall handle reviewer selection and ensure that reviewers are free from influences of groups or organizations with vested interests in marine resource usage by obtaining written assurances of no conflict of interest from all reviewers. After reviewer selection, the CIE shall make all necessary travel arrangements for the reviewers; copy and distribute background materials provided by NMFS; and provide intermediate status reports, final written reviews from each reviewer, and a complete accounting of distributed funds. To ensure that the reviews provided to NMFS are of the highest possible quality, the CIE shall thoroughly examine status and draft reports submitted by the reviewers for content, clarity, and compliance with NMFS' task order before passing completed reports to NMFS for final approval. Unless the requirement for a consensus report is specified in the task order, each reviewer's report shall be submitted individually to NMFS. Reviews facilitated by the CIE will vary in scope and duration. Most reviewers will be asked to carry out short-term, narrowly focused assignments requiring approximately 1-3 weeks of their time. The deliverable for a short-term review would typically be a 10-30 page report. Some reviewers could be involved in longer-term projects with a wider scope and more comprehensive deliverable. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPERTS: The reviewers chosen by the CIE must be demonstrably highly reputable experts in the field that is the subject of their review; they must have be able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the applied nature of the science that supports NMFS' mission; and they must be free from even the appearance of any conflict of interest. Reviewers should have a PhD or equivalent degree in a relevant field, five or more years of relevant experience, ten or more peer-reviewed publications in a relevant field, and have a record of successful participation in working groups or scientific review panels.  CAPABILITIES OF THE CIE: The contractor for the CIE must be a research institution with an international reputation in fisheries science, with capabilities to identify and obtain the services of appropriate domestic and foreign scientists, to evaluate and improve the quality of draft reports, to handle the logistics of arranging travel and distributing materials to all regions of the United States, and to manage and administer domestic and international contracts. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The contractor will be selected based on past performance; the proposed processes for running the CIE, selecting reviewers, and avoiding conflicts of interest; and cost. The period of performance shall be July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007.

As a result of these questions, the Technical Requirement #1 in the statement of work is revised to read as follows:  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  1.   The BUMED research team will provide the contractor with the study questionnaire.  The contractor shall provide printing and production of the questionnaire, and perform the analyses on the returned written comments from respondents.?

QUESTION #1:  Will Navy Medical Department civilian and active duty personnel be involved in the survey?
ANSWER #1:  Only Active Duty

QUESTION #2:  Please discuss your expectations regarding sampling? Will all Navy Medical personnel receive the survey or will sampling be used? If all, please indicate the number of survey recipients.  If sampling, will the sample be stratified by MOS?  If yes, what level of statistical significance do you expect by MOS?  Also, if stratified by MOS can a listing of military and civilian MOS codes be provided and an estimate of the number of personnel assigned to each MOS?

QUESTION #3:  The solicitation indicates the contractor shall provide the survey in one section and that the government will provide the survey in another section. Please clarify.  If there is an existing survey may a copy be provided for our use in evaluating survey processing requirements and for determining our price?  Also, do you anticipate any changes to the survey? If yes, please quantify the changes in terms of number of questions increased or decreased.
ANSWER #3:  The survey will be provided to the contractor at time of award.  No changes are anticipated for this year.

QUESTION #4:  Please discuss your expectations regarding the mailing methodology that will be used for the survey. Do you desire a pre-notification letter prior to the first survey? How much time do you wish between the first survey and reminder postcard? Do you require a second survey mailing?  If yes, how much time do you desire between the reminder postcard and second survey mailing? How long after the last survey mailing will the survey field period last? Why are you specifying ?work address? rather than home address? Has BUMED already determined that ?research participants? or may the contractor use random sampling?
ANSWER #4:  Survey questionnaires will be mailed to each individual with a cover letter.  If survey is not returned after two weeks, a reminder will be sent.

QUESTION #5:  Should the two option years be priced as CLIN 2 and CLIN 3?  Based on your sampling expectations (in response to questions listed above), do you anticipate any increases or decreases in the number of surveys that are sent or changes in the survey instrument that would add or reduce pages?
ANSWER #5:  Yes, price the two option years as CLIN 0002 and CLIN 0003.   No changes in the number of surveys is anticipated.  However, there may be changes to the survey during the option years.

QUESTION #6:  Has this survey been completed in the past?  If yes, who was the survey vendor and what was the annual and total value of their contract?  For the most recent year of their contract, please provide an overview of their scope of work including the number of surveys distributed and the response rate.
QUESTION #6:   Yes.  SPSS, Inc. was the vendor and the total price for the 2001 survey was $80,850. The SOW and number of surveys was similar to the current requirement. The survey has been completed annually since 1998.

QUESTION #7:  Will all surveys require U.S. postage? Is there a chance of foreign postage?

ANSWER #9:  Yes

QUESTION #10:  What percentage response rate is acceptable to the Navy?
ANSWER #10:  50%

QUESTION #11:  Does the Navy foresee the need for telephone contact to increase response rate?
ANSWER #11:  Only if response rates are dismally low.

QUESTION #12:  How many locations are the questionnaires to be sent to or are the questionnaires sent to each individual separately for completion and mailed back individually?
ANSWER #12:  Questionnaires are sent individually and mailed back individually

QUESTION #13:  When was the last time an attitude survey taken?

The website is developed and operated via a unique collaboration between the DOC which provides substantive content and exporting solutions, and IBM Corporation which provides e-business and supporting technology solutions.  The buyusa program operates under the U.S.&FCS cost recovery authority; subscription fees for varying levels of service are paid by U.S. participants, and the resulting revenue is shared by the DOC and IBM, and potentially by other buyusa partners located via this notice. Buyusa registration is free to International companies.  

During Government FY-2002 buyusa seeks to expand offerings to both U.S. and International companies, and in so doing will consider proposals from private sector entities engaged in one (1) or more business lines which have clear potential to increase and/or facilitate exporting by U.S. SME's.  Those seeking buyusa program participation must meet the following criteria:

1. identify at least one existing and operational online service or product which benefits  exporting or export-related activities of small-to-medium-sized U.S. businesses. Online capabilities which may meet this criterion include export and trade education, international business intelligence, trade contact location, export logistics and compliance, regulatory or other trade governance information/ services, trade finance, international transaction completion, shipping, payment, currency and language conversion, and the like. 

2. demonstrated sustained operation for at least two(2) full-years and a sustainable business plan and model.

3. suitability for presence on a U.S. Government website, indicating that:

  no criminal or civil violations are on record or charged and pending resolution.

  no debarment or documented unfair trade practices, or charges thereof by a foreign Government, are on record or pending.

  no online offerings or business practices are illegal or inappropriate in the U.S. or foreign countries served by buyusa.com, and

  no clear potential for embarrassment to the U.S. Government exists which might jeopardize the U.S.&FCS mission of promoting U.S. exports abroad.

4. express willingness to offer the online service(s) and/or product(s) in accordance with all applicable terms and conditions of buyusa.com and of U.S. Government websites generally.

<SUBJECT>59 -- In-Transit Visibility (ITV) as compatible with current USMC Information System architecture and shipboard systems.
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N47408-02-R-2324
<RESPDATE>053102
<CONTACT>Pearl Wray, Contract Specialist, Phone 805-982-1911, Fax 805-982-4540, Email WrayP@cbchue.navfac.navy.mil - Soledad Credo, Contracting Officer , Phone 805-982-3947, Fax 805-982-4540, Email CredoSP@cbchue.navfac.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) is seeking sources of COMMERCIALLY available technologies suitable for In-Transit Visibility (ITV) is defined as: The ability to track identity, status, and location of supplies and equipment cargo (excluding bulk petroleum, oils and lubricants) from origin to consignee or destination across the range of military operations. We envision Naval transportation nodes (ARG, MPF shipping) will be instrumented to allow the capture of ITV data at entry/exit points (Well Decks, Vehicle ramps, underway replenishment stations).  Sustainment items (rolling stock, 20-ft shipping containers, Quadroons, palletized loads) will have RFID tags/sensors affixed.  This ITV architecture should be compatible with current USMC Information System architecture and shipboard systems.  The system will be designed for high portability/transport and can be rapidly employed and put into service without extensive support equipment or specialized crew.  The system will need to be designed to achieve high reliability; availability and durability to ensure it will be operational under extreme conditions.  Technical objectives consist of optimized design configurations based on transportability, interoperability and employment requirements; high reliability, availability, maintainability and durability; safety features, and advanced materials that either eliminate or significantly reduce life cycle costs.  Key components of this system demonstration will be the sensors and the readers to be used in detecting the presence of items.  The sensors will be attached to the items of interest, for example a truck or container.  The readers will be used to locate the sensors (e.g. the items) and transmit the location data to a central storage device such as a computer server.  The computer server would be provided with the ability to interface (seamlessly) with the shipboard IT 21 infrastructure and into the Navy-Marine Corp network.  The data would then be accessible from remote locations via the Network. The project office conducted an initial assessment of the technical challenges involved in this effort.  This assessment identified a number of issues or factors that potentially may influence/impact the design of this RFID system. These issues include: (1) Physical/Environmental: Exposure to moisture, weather, saltwater, wear on the equipment, etc. and the need to perform a ship alteration if the RFID system was permanently installed on-board ship; (2) Radio Frequency Issues: On-board and host nation frequency approval issues that may preclude a system from being employed; (3) Wireless Security: Encryption, Authentication etc. Need to be aware of security requirements for passing data wirelessly from Tag to Interrogator to Server.  (RF Issues should include wireless security); (4) Life Cycle Support: Battery life, high reliability, availability, maintainability and durability, etc; (5) Safety: Portability vs. non-portability, tying into the ships electrical system, RF interference issues, etc. Respondents should provide the following information:  Name and address of Company, Company Point-of-Contact with phone and fax number (email address if available), Brochures and/or pamphlets and technical data concerning technical challenges involved in this effort.  Responses should pertain only to Equipment Product Information sought, do not include software/software development information. Deadline for receipt of response is 31 May 2002. Submit all responses to: Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Contracts Office, Port Hueneme, 3502 Goodspeed Street, Suite 2 Building 41, Port Hueneme, CA, 92043-4337. It is requested that all proprietary information that is not to be disseminated in government documents be clearly identified. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR SOLICIATION AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE RESPONSE HERETO, OR ON FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION SUBSEQUENTLY SOUGHT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MADE.
