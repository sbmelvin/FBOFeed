Unless a significant price disparity exists which deems a large business suitable for award, award will be made to a small business. Multiple awards will not be considered. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, offerors' initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. At a minimum, the offeror must submit an offer schedule which asserts they will provide the supplies/services to the minimum standards indicated in the solicitation/PWS; however, it is recommended that as much information as possible be provided for the best value evaluation. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government.  "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In accordance with FAR 12.602 & FAR 13.106-2, technical, price & past performance will be considered in the streamlined evaluation. In the best value decision, the Government may consider any readily available value indicators (examples include past performance, special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance, trade-in considerations, probable life of the item, warranty considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, and delivery terms). This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror. The Government's selection of a higher-priced, higher rated offer will be supported by a determination that the technical/past performance superiority of the higher-priced offer warrants the additional cost involved. <br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, 52.212-4 is amended as follows: Paragraph (g) (1): Change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices.

<DESC>Training Barracks Upgrade Program FY12 (TBUP 12) - Barracks, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri<br><br>The following is a Sources Sought notice and also serves as the Pre-Solicitation Notice for this requirement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, intends to issue a Design-Bid-Build Solicitation on or about August 06, 2012 on the FedBizOps website at www.fbo.gov for the Trainee Barracks Upgrade Program TBUP 12 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The Government will accept proposals from all offerors that qualify under NACIS code 236220. The size standard is $33.5 million. A set-aside or unrestricted determination will be disclosed in the solicitation. This solicitation will be issued as a one step Request for Proposal (RFP) which will result in the award of a single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. In accordance with FAR 36.204 and DFARS 236.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is: Between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.<br><br>This Project is a Design-Bid-Build Project consisting primarily of renovation of two existing three story barracks and an optional Advanced Individual Training (AIT) barracks. All buildings are located in Fort Leonard Wood.  The two barracks are approximately 40,640 square feet each. The Project includes furnishing all procurement, installation, plant, labor, equipment, materials, and transportation and performing all required work to provide complete and usable facilities. The renovation is intended to be functionally and technically similar to a dormitory in the private sector community surrounding the Installation. This Project includes the reconfiguration of existing squad bays to open troop bay type layouts for a maximum 240 personnel capacity. Each barracks building also has work classified as "new work" which includes a new three-story addition with individual floor area of approximately 960 square feet per floor as shown on the Drawings. Minor landscaping is required for each building along with asbestos abatement. Each barracks will be up-graded to current seismic and progressive collapse standards.<br>The AIT Barracks rehabilitation includes the reconfiguration of the existing barracks sleeping quarters to sleeping rooms, each accommodating three soldiers. The first floor contains 26 sleeping rooms housing 78 individuals. The second and third floors each contain 28 sleeping rooms, each housing 84 individuals. The total capacity for all three floors is therefore 246 personnel. The Project also has construction classified as "new work" that includes the new three-story addition on the front of the building. This addition includes a new three-story stair and an entry and CQ on the first floor. The total new area of all three floors is approximately 685 square feet.<br><br>The following information is requested in this Sources Sought (SS):<br>1.

Please provide at least one point of contact (with email address and phone number) for project validation.  <br>4. Firm's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity;<br>5. Firm's small business category and business size (Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (Hub-Zone), Women Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) and Historical Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI));<br>6. Firm's Joint Venture information, if applicable; and<br>7. Firm's Bonding Capability (construction bonding level per contract and aggregate bonding level, both expressed in dollars) via letter from bonding company.<br>8. Briefly discuss the cost variations of completing this project as a whole or bidding one building.  Would this affect your participation? Drive your cost up or down? Are there schedule advantages?  <br><br>Please send your SS responses no later than 14 days from the date of this notice via email to Tammy.D.Chambers@usace.army.mil.<br><br>This solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) which will result in the award of a single firm-fixed price (FFP) construction contract.

Contractors will be able to log into one system to manage their entity information in one record, with one expiration date, through one streamlined business process. Contractors currently registered in CCR will receive an email notification letting them know when their account is about to expire, and they will complete that process in SAM, if their account expires after SAM goes live. New contractors shall complete ORCA and CCR through SAM.<br><br>VETS-100 Requirement: Per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 22.1303 all offerors must complete their VETS-100 report via the Department of Labor website at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ to be eligible for award.<br><br>Points of Contact: The point of contact for all questions/inquiries is Tammy Chambers and can be reached by phone at (816)389-3817 or by email at Tammy.D.Chambers@usace.army.mil.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>US Army Engineer District, Kansas City, ATTN: CENWK-CT, 647 Federal Building 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106-2896 <br><br>Place of Performance: <br>Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri<br><br>Point of Contact(s): <br>Tammy Chambers, 816-389-3817<br><br><br>The solicitation will be for a Design-Bid-Build Project, consisting primarily for the renovation of two existing, three-story barracks and an optional Advanced Individual Training (AIT) barracks.
