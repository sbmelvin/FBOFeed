<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Office of  Procurement Services intends to conduct a limited, public/private competition to acquire Oracle Federal Financials Commercial-Off-the-Shelf software, Information Technology (IT) hosting and administration, application management services, and system implementation services from a federal or commercial Financial Management Line of Business (FMLoB) Shared Service Provider. Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum, Competition Framework for Financial Management Lines of Business Migrations, dated May 22, 2006; the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance [Version 1], dated September 13, 2006; and applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). DOL has a significant monetary investment in Oracle Federal Financials that it desires to maximize for its benefit. Therefore, this acquisition is restricted to SSPs whose offers are based on Oracle Federal Financials software.

The objective of this program is to modernize DOL's core financial management functions by transitioning from its legacy systems to a FSIO-compliant financial management SSP that already complies with Federal Information Security and Privacy requirements by having Authority To Operate (ATO) from a Designated Approving Authority (DAA) and the Security Certification & Accreditation (SC&A) that must accompany that ATO status. The primary goals of this acquisition are to modernize DOL's ability to conduct financial management functions; reduce the number of disparate, overlapping legacy systems & data; and establish an environment that provides all levels of leadership with reliable, relevant, and timely information on an enterprise-wide basis.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519 and the Small Business Size Standard is $23.0 million. The award will be a performance-based, task-order type contract with both Time & Materials (T&M) and fixed-price task orders issued.  DOL anticipates the resulting contract award to be for a period of one (1) base year plus eight (8) one year option periods.  DOL expects to issue the Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about January 15, 2008 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). The required receipt date and time for proposals will be included in the RFP. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring FedBizOpps to ensure their access to the most current information available on this acquisition. No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811310   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with JEOL for preventative maintenance for the JEOL JSM-6490LV, JEOL JSM-5800LV Scanning Electron Microscopes, and the JEOL JEM-1200EXII Transmission Electron Microscope.   The US EPA requires a contractor which possesses the unique capabilities of servicing and performing preventative maintenance for the JEOL instruments identified above.  JEOL is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the  parts and products they support.  No other company has a similar level of information available or accessible to the service engineers.  Therefore, JEOL is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s) because of its access to the engineering and electronic components needed  for service and repair of the equipment. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the  posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement  or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 811310.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>**ONLY FOR BRAND NAME OR EQUAL & MEET OR EXCEED BUYS, TO HAVE A BID CONSIDERED FOR AWARD, ALL VENDORS MUST PROVIDE MANUFACTURER, PART # AND EXTENDED SPECIFICATIONS OF THE EXACT MODEL BEING PROPOSED FOR ALL LINE ITEMS. NO EXEPTIONS. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the ImageTrac Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the ImageTrac Scanner as the U.S. Passport application process is a paper-based process with a variety of different document types being scanned.  IBML systems provide unique paper track handling for the Passport environment and have proven reliable and technologically advanced in the marketplace over the past 10 years.  CA/CST/PS has chosen the IBML system for the following reasons: -	No other vendor has demonstration the ability to handle the unique needs of the Passport scanning environment, which includes scanning packets that can include applications, supporting documentation such as an old Passport, FedEx envelopes, etc. -	IBML scanners are uniquely able to process, at high speed, the wide variety of documents Passport scans including documents with staples. -	IBML scanners are already integrated with Passports key systems and support infrastructure from an operations and maintenance perspective. -	The IBML technology has been a reliable component of the Passport Systems architecture for almost 10 years. -	IBML has continued to work with CST to assure that the scanning platforms remain compatible with Passport-specific needs -	IBML can support the time constraints to deliver the equipment to DoS, as well as the custom software tools (API) to control scanner elements from within TDIS -	Changing scanner technology would incur a length integration, test, and certification cycle which is currently untenable for the business. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>CST currently has 39 IBML ImageTrac systems deployed to support Passport Systems scanning requirements.  These requirements include scanning Passport applications as they are received to collect applicants photos digitally for the Passport book as part of the TDIS Photo Digitalization process, as well as the archiving of annotated/adjudicated Passport applications as part of the PRISM system.  Recently, the Passport application workload has increased dramatically, going from 12 million to 18 million in FY07.  In support of this increase in Passport demand, the Department of State now has a need to procure six (6) additional ImageTrac scanners in order to keep up with its application workload, and modernize the Passport Systems to support advanced scanning/imaging features that will increase productivity, image quality, and consistency amongst processing facilities. Over 50 million Passport applications have been processed on these devices which have been integrated and tested with Passports core issuance system, TDIS.  Incorporating additional ImageTrac scanners into the existing enterprise will provide a direct increase in capacity while enabling Passport to evolve its approach to scanning and document imaging.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NOTE CHANGE IN ANTICIPATED RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Geographic Medicine and Health Promotion Branch, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ), Travelers? Health Team has responsibility for a textbook for health-care providers, Health Information for International Travel (the ?Yellow Book?). The Yellow Book, also available in its entirety online, has long been considered the ?gold standard? of travel medicine, both in the United States and abroad. Information contained in the Yellow Book is heavily relied on by health-care practitioners, travelers, the travel industry, and others who advise travelers, and is frequently cited in medical as well as non-medical publications, including news media such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. The production team for the Yellow Book continues to work towards creating a resource that contains current health recommendations for international travel, delivered in a user-friendly format that can be readily applied in the clinical setting.  The book is published every two years, with the most recent book (Yellow Book 2008) published in May 2007.  DGMQ?s objective is to make the 2010 version of the Yellow Book more useful for and more targeted to US travel medicine and general healthcare practitioners. DGMQ is seeking the services of a physician expert in travel medicine to serve as a Medical Editor (ME) for the 2010 edition. It is expected that the scientific and technical contribution of the ME to the 2010 edition would result in increased usability of the book by the 40,000 US general healthcare practitioners and 2000 travel medicine specialists who are asked to provide pre travel advice to patients planning international travel and who see patients after they return from travel.  Services required will be as follows: 1) Review 2008 Yellow Book; 2) Formulate vision for 2010 Yellow Book; 3) Develop instructions for authors; 4) Develop Table of Contents for new edition; 5) Identify subjects for  special box commentaries; 6) Identify additional external authors; 7) Liaise with external authors; 8) Write selected chapters; 9) Write special box commentaries; 10) Edit 1/3 of the chapters; 11) Liaise with publisher after submission; 12) Develop marketing strategies for increased distribution; 13) Book promotion after publication.  The cycle of production for the next version (Yellow Book 2010) began in September 2007 and will be completed when the 2010 book is published in May 2009.  It is expected that the overall time spent on the project by the ME will be approximately two months per year for two years.  The ME will not be required to work at CDC; the work can be done from home, but travel to CDC or other locations will be expected several times a year to meet with CDC staff.  A best value request for quotations for these services will be issued on or about 4 January 2008 with award anticipated on or about 7 February 2008.  All responsible sources will be invited to submit proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>DOE Transitioning To Electronic Procurement System
<DESC>The Department of Energy (the Department), including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), will implement the Strategic Integrated Procurement Enterprise System (STRIPES) during fiscal years 2008 and 2009. As a result, the Department will begin using FedConnect, which is hosted by Compusearch, as the communications portal for its potential and actual contractor and financial assistance recipient communities (entities) beginning in March 2008 instead of the current system (IIPS). Therefore, in order to do business with the Department, all current and potential acquisition and financial assistance awardees must be registered with Compusearchs FedConnect portal. Notices and solicitations, required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), will continue to be sent to FedBizOpps (FBO), with additional information available to interested entities on Compusearchs FedConnect portal. Similarly, financial opportunity announcements that must be published on Grants.gov will continue to be transmitted there also, with additional information provided at the FedConnect portal. The FedConnect portal will be used throughout the lifecycle of the Departments acquisition and financial assistance instruments from the presolicitation/planning phase to instrument close-out. The Departments STRIPES will communicate with external entities via FedConnect on matters related to acquisition or financial solicitation or award actions. We are advising current and potential contractors and financial assistance recipients to register with FedConnect at your earliest convenience at https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ .  Please note FedConnect is used by multiple federal agencies and therefore, assistance with FedConnect will be provided by Compusearch, not the Department of Energy. Contact information is be provided on the FedConnect web site at https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ In addition, we are recommending that all organizations that want to do business with the Department of Energy register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), even those who are not required to be registered by the Federal Acquisition Regulation as this facilitates registration on FedConnect. In general, the system functionality of FedConnect requires that all organization be registered with the CCR, before registering with FedConnect. The Department is promoting this approach, since it will make communications between the Department and organizations doing business with the Department more integrated, faster, and auditable. However, if your organization is not required by acquisition and/or financial assistance regulations to be registered with the CCR and CCR registration is not practicable, please contact the Department's Help Desk at 800-683-0751 for assistance with FedConnect registration. Additional information or comments regarding this matter may be submitted via email to STRIPES@hq.doe.gov .

CONFLICT OF INTERESET: 
FDA 1338 Individual Conflict of Interest

As a regulatory agency charged with protection of public health, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must maintain public confidence in the integrity of its decisions.  The FDA has policies and procedures that safeguard against actual and apparent conflict of interest on the part of its employees.  In contracting for review and evaluation of scientific data and information submitted to the agency, it is critical that the FDA be assured that there is no actual or apparent conflict of interest on the part of the individual contractor.  Offers performing work under this contract must assure the protection of information and data they receive under this contract from unauthorized use or disclosure, and must avoid actions that would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the contractor.

DEFINITION of Conflict of Interest

Conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons or organizations, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, that the person's objectivity in performing the contract is or might be otherwise impaired, or that the person has or might acquire an unfair competitive advantage (see FAR 9.501).

CONTRACTOR'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST RESPONSIBILITIES
The individual contractor must be free of interest prior to performing under this contract.
Anytime prior to or during the performance of the contract the individual contractor believes that a potential or actual conflict exists, the individual should notify the project officer. The project officer will determine whether or not a conflict of interest exists and how to resolve or mitigate it. The contractor should not commence or continue working on the contract until directed by the project officer.

3.	Any contracts, grants, or cooperative research and development assignments that you are working on or have under negotiation;

4.	Any other sources of income (not mentioned above)

5.	Any other relevant information concerning any past, present, or planned interests that may have a bearing on the responsibilities described in the Statement of Work.

The project officer shall conduct a review if the information submitted and determine if a conflict of interest exists prior to forwarding any documents to the contractor.

In executing this contract, the individual contractor agrees:

1.	To report to the proper authority within the FDA (the Project Officer), any situation or event that may constitute a conflict of interest, whether actual or potential.

4.	Not to disclose any information and/or data within his or her purview,  or to which he/she has access as a result of performing work under this contract.

EVALUATION:

The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical, which encompasses experience and past performance factors, and cost/price factors.  Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall decision.  All evaluation factors, other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance.  Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on the other factors.

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Request For Quote (RFQ). The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.  Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFQ.  Offeror must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK Project # 540-08-501 Angiographic Room Site Preparation 1. General Intention: It is the intention of the VA to acquire a contractor to prepare Room 2210 (X-Ray room) to accept the installation of a GE Innova 4100 system.  All work shall be in accordance with GE drawings C1, A1, S1, S2, E1, E2, E3, E4, D1 and D2 dated 5-14-07.  The contractor is responsible for all work noted on the drawings as Customer/Contractor supplied and/or installed. 2. Specific Work: The following are specific items but is not limited to all the work to be accomplished by the contractor in accordance with the drawings: A.	Cut holes in the existing floor and install the Table Baseplate, Positioner Baseplate and Chilled Water line.  The contractor shall use Ground Penetrating Radar to locate rebar and/or post tension cables located within the concrete floor.  The holes will be located to miss any cables/rebar and will be cut, core drilled or drilled.  The system can be positioned up to 2 towards the control wall and 18 towards the positioner end (coordinate with Project Engineer). B.	Install ductwork as shown on drawings. C.	Construct equipment room with sliding room doors (louvered for proper equipment ventilation). D.	Install Main Disconnect and power for equipment. E.	Install ceiling mounted cable drape rail. F.	Install chilled water line. G.	Install telephone/data wiring and outlets. H.	Install warning lights and door controller. I.	Relocate existing Medical Gases (AOV) to opposite side of room and have the system recertified. 3.  Infection Prevention Measures: A.	Implement the requirements of VAMCs Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) team. ICRA Group may monitor dust in the vicinity of the construction work and require the Contractor to take corrective action immediately if the safe levels are exceeded. B.	Establish and maintain a dust control program as part of the contractors infection preventive measures in accordance with the guidelines provided by ICRA Group//as specified here//. Prior to start of work, prepare a plan detailing project-specific dust protection measures, including periodic status reports, and submit to  Project  Engineer  and Facility ICRA team for review. 1.	All personnel involved in the construction or renovation activity shall be educated and trained in infection prevention measures established by the medical center. C.	Medical center Infection Control personnel shall monitor for airborne disease (e.g. aspergilluss) as appropriate during construction. A baseline of conditions may be established by the medical center prior to the start of work and periodically during the construction stage to determine impact of construction activities on indoor air quality. In addition: 1.	The PE and VAMC Infection Control personnel shall review pressure differential monitoring documentation to verify that pressure differentials in the construction zone and in the patient-care rooms are appropriate for their settings. The requirement for negative air pressure in the construction zone shall depend on the location and type of activity. Upon notification, the contractor shall implement corrective measures to restore proper pressure differentials as needed. 2.	In case of any problem, the medical center, along with assistance from the contractor, shall conduct an environmental assessment to find and eliminate the source. D.	In general, following preventive measures shall be adopted during construction to keep down dust and prevent mold.  1.	Dampen debris to keep down dust and provide temporary construction partitions in existing structures where directed by Resident Engineer. Blank off ducts and diffusers to prevent circulation of dust into occupied areas during construction. 2.	Do not perform dust producing tasks within occupied areas without the approval of the Resident Engineer. For construction in any areas that will remain jointly occupied by the medical Center and Contractors workers, the Contractor shall: a.	Provide dust proof one-hour temporary drywall construction barriers to completely separate construction from the operational areas of the hospital in order to contain dirt debris and dust. Barriers shall be sealed and made presentable on hospital occupied side. Install a self-closing rated door in a metal frame, commensurate with the partition, to allow worker access. Maintain negative air at all times. A fire retardant polystyrene, 6-mil thick or greater plastic barrier meeting local fire codes may be used where dust control is the only hazard, and an agreement is reached with the Resident Engineer and Medical Center. b.	HEPA filtration is required where the exhaust dust may reenter the breathing zone.  Contractor shall verify that construction exhaust to exterior is not reintroduced to the medical center through intake vents, or building openings. Install HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Accumulator) filter vacuum system rated at 95% capture of 0.3 microns including pollen, mold spores and dust particles. Insure continuous negative air pressures occurring within the work area. HEPA filters should have ASHRAE 85 or other prefilter to extend the useful life of the HEPA. Provide both primary and secondary filtrations units. Exhaust hoses shall be heavy duty, flexible steel reinforced and exhausted so that dust is not reintroduced to the medical center. c.	Adhesive Walk-off/Carpet Walk-off Mats, minimum 600mm x 900mm (24 x 36), shall be used at all interior transitions from the construction area to occupied medical center area. These mats shall be changed as often as required to maintain clean work areas directly outside construction area at all times. d.	Vacuum and wet mop all transition areas from construction to the occupied medical center at the end of each workday. Vacuum shall utilize HEPA filtration. Maintain surrounding area frequently. Remove debris as they are created. Transport these outside the construction area in containers with tightly fitting lids. e.	The contractor shall not haul debris through patient-care areas without prior approval of the Resident Engineer and the Medical Center. When, approved, debris shall be hauled in enclosed dust proof containers or wrapped in plastic and sealed with duct tape. No sharp objects should be allowed to cut through the plastic. Wipe down the exterior of the containers with a damp rag to remove dust. All equipment, tools, material, etc. transported through occupied areas shall be made free from dust and moisture by vacuuming and wipe down.  f.	Using a HEPA vacuum, clean inside the barrier and vacuum ceiling tile prior to replacement. Any ceiling access panels opened for investigation beyond sealed areas shall be sealed immediately when unattended. g.	There shall be no standing water during construction. This includes water in equipment drip pans and open containers within the construction areas. All accidental spills must be cleaned up and dried within 12 hours. Remove and dispose of porous materials that remain damp for more than 72 hours. h.	At completion, remove construction barriers and ceiling protection carefully, outside of normal work hours. Vacuum and clean all surfaces free of dust after the removal. E.	Final Cleanup: 1.	Upon completion of project, or as work progresses, remove all construction debris from above ceiling, vertical shafts and utility chases that have been part of the construction. 2.	Perform HEPA vacuum cleaning of all surfaces in the construction area. This includes walls, ceilings, cabinets, furniture (built-in or free standing), partitions, flooring, etc. 3.	All new air ducts shall be cleaned prior to final inspection END

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Given Imaging Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-22. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. This procurement is to acquire one GIVEN Workstation with 20 inch monitor (P/N: 40300), two DataRecorder 2C Kits (P/N: 40281) and 3 PillCam SB 2 10-Pak Kits (P/N: FGS-0180). Rational for Sole-Source Purchase:  NWIHCS has a significant number of Attending, Consulting, Fellow and Resident physicians who rotate between the Omaha VA Medical Center and these affiliated medical schools and university hospitals.  Given Imagings PillCam Endoscopy system is already in use at our medical affiliates, both University of Nebraska College of Medicine/UNMC and Creighton University College of Medicine/CUMC.   To ensure the highest level of patient safety, it is important that the Omaha VA Medical Center utilize the same equipment so that these rotating physicians are all clinically competent to use this form of video endoscopy no matter which location the procedure is being done at.  This is especially important when considering the competency of on-call staff who provide night, weekend and holiday coverage at both the Omaha VA Medical Center and the affiliated hospitals. Our medical residency training programs utilize this equipment in the training programs at both affiliates.  For continuity of training, the VA requires the same equipment. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, January 3rd, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (402) 449-0612.

<DESC>Only authorized resellers of McCabe IQ annual software maintenance products should reply to this posting. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519.  The NGA plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order under FAR Part 12 and 13.     The requirement is for the following items:

1) Annual Maintenance of 56 McCabe IQ perpetual software licenses (Part Number M-IQ-SERVER).  The period of performance for maintenance shall be 01 Feb 2008 through 31 Jan 0009.  

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:    

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for annual software maintenance as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of McCabe. The McCabe suite of software products have already been integrated into the NGA enterprise. Due to this fact, it would be extremely costly to switch to a new type of software. Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of the software. The McCabe IQ suite of products is the only software suite that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of the NGA at this time.      

Delivery is FOB Destination.     Delivery will be made to:     NGA Arnold, 3838 Vogel Rd., Arnold, MO 63010-6238.

<DESC>Description
Here are the questions and answers concerning the above combined synopsis/solicitation.**********
************************************
Contractor Questions
(Solicitation #F3W3177248A003: Security Forces Training)**********
Question:  Do the mission essential tasks and/or tasks, conditions, and standards exist for these courses,
or would the government like the contractor to develop these?
********************************************************
Answer:  The contractor can develop these; however, it is the government?s which to review same to ensure they are compatible with mission success and mirror current training in place.
 **********************************************************
Question:  Will the course curriculum be provided by the government, or will the contractor be expected
to design these products? (These products would include the lesson guides, power point briefs, student handouts, practical evolution briefs, and quizzes/tests)
*****************************************************************
Answer:  The curriculum, while reviewed by the government (again to ensure compatibility), and all other components will be provided by the contractor.
*****************************************************************
Question: Section 3.1.1 states, ?Two courses, five days each?.?, however there are three (3) CLINS;
Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced CQB.  Should we assume the Advanced Course will be developed and conducted, based on the lessons learned from conducting the Basic and Intermediate courses first?
***************************************************************
Answer:  The reason the advanced course listed is not listed, is due to the unit?s inability to supply what could potentially be the range requirements for an advanced course.  We currently have an indoor range with a maximum distance of 25 meters, and therefore, most advanced courses would require something more.  Additionally, it is more important we have everyone in the unit on the same training level vs. having only some trained in advanced techniques.
*******************************
	a. Section 3.1.1 also states two courses are five days each. Can we assume the Advanced course will also be five days long?
*********************************************************
At this time, we do not request the advanced course; however, if ever implemented, yes it too, would be five days long.
*******************************************************
Question: Section 3.2, Course Breakdown, discusses the Basic course description, however, doesn?t discuss the Intermediate or Advanced Course.  Can we get clarification as to why section 3.2 only described the Basic course?
***************************************************************
Answer:  The government requests the intermediate course build on the skills taught during the Basic course. Curriculum could include more advanced room clearing techniques and actions to be taken upon entry into the objective; mechanical breaching techniques for entering doors and windows; how to manage and control a barricaded situation within the objective; less-lethal applications and hostage rescue options, as well as open-air take-downs such as car, bus or train objectives.
**************************************************************
Question:  Mechanical Breaching includes the use of mechanical tools such as sledge hammers, hooligan tools, bolt cutters, various saws and steel cutting torches, battering rams, and shotguns just to name a few. Can we get a more detailed idea of what type of structures the students are expected to breach and the type of tools available to them?
*****************************************************************
Answer:  We currently have the following mechanical breaching tools in our inventory:  sledge hammers, halligan tools, monoshock battering ram, and ballistic shotguns.  As far as structures are concerned, the training environment is limited to structures currently on the demolition list, providing students actual hands-on opportunity to use the tools.  However, in an actual special threat situation, breach points may be, in fact, entry points of which students do not have the capability to train with.
*****************************************************************
Question:  Class Start Date: This section states training will begin in January 2008.  The following are questions regarding the schedule:
*************************************************************
Answer:  Will there be only one course in progress at a time, or multiple courses in varying skill levels (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced) taking place simultaneously? (The answer to this will allow us to calculate the number of instructors.)
The Government  cannot support multiple courses running simultaneously (ie, manning).  In a one month/four week period, the Government prefers a basic and intermediate course to run consecutively and then be repeated with a new group of students.
****************************************************************
Question:  Will the number and frequency of courses and training that?s expected to take place, because for the instructor staff to physically relocate to Germany during the contract duration?
*************************************************************
Answer:  Of course, depending on where the instructors are coming from, it would be best for them to stay locally for the duration of each course?but, not the duration of the contract.
**************************************************************
Question:   Can the government give a more detailed estimate on the quantity and frequency of these courses during the contract period?
*****************************************************************
Answer:   The government is looking for four four-week course blocks.  Meaning, in the next 10-12 months, the government would like 4 months of training provided by the contractor, but spread out evenly to provide all SF members an opportunity to be trained.  Due to current operations tempo, SF members are rotating out 6-8 months at a time; therefore we need to spread the wealth, so to speak.
*******************************************************
Question:  Will all three (3) CQB courses be taught consecutively (back to back courses), with the same students attending these courses?**************************************
Answer:  Yes, although again, we are concerned we cannot support the advanced course.  In addition, to run a basic, intermediate, and advanced course back to back, leaves one extra week.  While this week could also be a basic course with new students, we now have a group that are at an advanced level, while another is only at a basic level and there is no guarantee these same students will be available when the contractor returns.  While the schedule is fluid, the government prefers to have basic and intermediate back to back, twice in each month, and then possibly the last month could be advanced courses only.
*************************************************
Question: Will the two 5-day courses run consecutively?
***********************************************************
Answer: As the current plan entails, there will be a basic and intermediate course, each 5-days, running consecutively.  On the third week, a new group of students will again begin the basic and intermediate course consecutively.
*************************************************************
Question: How many iterations of training are planned for the projected 12-month period?
*************************************************************
Answer:  Four (4) months of training are projected, spread out among the 12 months.  Each month will consist of 2 basic and 2 intermediate courses.
**************************************************************
Question:  What is the desired interval and frequency of training?
********************************************************
Answer:   To enhance training for all SF members, it is required each month of training be equally spread out to provide opportunity for individuals TDY.  Therefore, while not set in stone, we would prefer time frames such as: February, April, June, August (if contract needs to be complete by FY 09) or February, May, August, November (if contract needs to be complete by CY 09).
***********************************************************
Question: The unit to be trained will provide all weapons and maintenance materials?
*************************************************************
Answer: Each student will have all their primary and alternate weapons on have (M-4 and M-9).
****************************************************************
Question: The unit to be trained will provide classroom and range training facilities?
*****************************************************************
Answer: The unit will provide a classroom accommodating up to 30 people and an indoor live fire range.  If other ranges are required, there would have to be additional coordination between bases and services.
*****************************************************************
Question: The unit to be trained will provide all 9mm and 5.56 ammunition for live fire training?
*****************************************************************
Answer: The unit will supply 9mm and 5.56 ammunition for live fire training; 
*************************************************************
Question: Are frangible 9mm and 5.56 munitions available?
**********************************************************
Answer: No, we currently do not have frangible rounds available.
*****************************************************************
Question: Does the unit have simmunitions kits for pistols and rifles?********************************************************
Answer: The unit currently has 15 M-4, 12 M-9, and 3 M-249 UTM brand simunition kits.  However, we have approximately 50 Simunition brand kits (both M-4 and M-9) which have been ordered and are currently sitting in port awaiting shipment.
****************************************************************
Question:  Will the Unit initially classify personnel into basic and intermediate skill level groups?
*****************************************************************
Answer: Yes, the unit will classify personnel into basic and intermediate skill level groups.  However, the plan is for those attending the basic course will automatically attend the intermediate course the next week.
*************************************************************
Question: Does the unit possess required special protective gear, i.e., ballistic body armor and eye protection?
*************************************************************
Answer: Yes, each student attending will have access to special protective gear, to include ballistic body armor, eye protection (goggles and/or glasses), neck protection, and gloves.
***********************************************************
Question:  Instructor qualifications, number 1.1.  This section states instructors shall be nationally certified as an instructor in firearms or law enforcement. The prior military (Special Operations Forces or SOF) firearms instructors that our company provides possess qualifications and experience which is significantly above and beyond that of a national certification or law enforcement firearms qualification.  Will the firearms instructor qualifications of a prior SOF (SEAL, Special Forces) instructor be acceptable? 
***************************************************************
Answer: Yes.
*********************************************************
Question:  Would we be correct in assuming the government will provide all the facilities (live-fire CQB training house/ranges/mechanical breaching facades/classroom), equipment (student?s personal operational gear to include ballistic helmets and ballistic vests w/plates, weapons, range equipment), and supplies (consumables to include ammunition, target materials and range support supplies) to support this training?
*****************************************************************
Answer: While we currently have limited facilities at our disposal, if it is determined more advanced areas are required, there can be some inter-service coordination with other local bases.  However, all other items, to include equipment, gear, and supplies will be provided by the government.
*************************************************************
Question:  Will (or can) the government provide non-lethal weapon training systems such as
Simmunitions?, Airsoft?, or paintball guns for the conduct of realistic scenario-based training (force on force training)? (Non-lethal weapon training systems are the most valuable training aid used in this type of training course that allows students to attain maximum proficiency in CQB).
*****************************************************************
Answer:  The government currently has 15 M-4, 12 M-9, and three M-249 UTM brand simunition kits and corresponding UTM brand simunitions for realistic training.  In addition, Simmunitions? have been ordered for the unit and currently are in port awaiting shipment.  There is no guarantee this brand will be available for the contractor training.
**********************************************************
Question:  Will the contractor instructors be afforded the opportunity to use lodging and messing
services on the base?
**********************************************************
Answer: As soon as the contractor is chosen, a schedule is agreed on, and an instructor list is provided, lodging can and will be reserved for each block of the contract.  All other services, to include the dining facility, will be available to the contractor instructors, although the contractor instructors will be required to pay in cash.
*************************************************************
Question: The students.  Will the students come from the same command, or various commands?
**************************************************
Answer: The students will come from the same command (USAFE)
***********************************************************
Question: Will all students attending the courses be at, or about the same skill level?***********************************
Answer:  Approximately, yes.  Of course, there are different experience levels from down range, prior EST experience, SRT Phase I graduates, etc., but all will attend the basic and intermediate course.
************************************************************
Question:  Will all students begin with the Basic CQB course, or will some students have the prerequisites to begin with the Intermediate course?
*****************************************************************
Answer: All students will begin with the basic CQB course.
********************************************************
Question: Does the government have a mandatory student to instructor ratio, or will this be left up to the contractor to decide?
**************************************************************
Answer: This will be up to the contractor to decide, as long as safety is the primary concern.  Any live-fire ranges will require coordination with out CATM personnel to ensure safety, as well.
*************************************************************
Question: What is the name of the command which the students will come from?
*****************************************************************
Answer: USAFE
****************************************************************
Question: What is the job description of the students attending the course?
************************************************
Answer:  Security Forces (Air Force Cops): 
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************AT THIS POINT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT QUESTIONS BUT KEEPS THE RIGHT TO START CLARIFICATIONS/NEGOTIATIONS WHEN REQUIRED.********************************************************THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IS EXTENDED UNTIL 2 JAN 2008, 17:00 HRS LOCAL TIME GERMANY.*******************************
