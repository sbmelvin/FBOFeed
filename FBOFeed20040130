<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The estimate cost of this award is $1,910,900.00. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). This award is for data analysis and evaluation, analysis reporting, system performance assessment, and system administration of the "MAKAH" suite in support of the Special High-Interest Analysis and Reporting Cell (SHARC) mission at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC, and is a follow-on award to a uniquely qualified source. Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government. To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the process of the program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay program completion by a minimum of 8 to 10 months and nearly double the cost. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only. This is Not a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received within (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. POC: Department of the Interior: Attention: Susan Benik, 381 Elden Street - MS2510, Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be faxed to the attention of Susan Benik at (703) 787-1022 or emailed to Susan.Benik@mms.gov. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for PC Signal Support for SSME LPFP Flow Liner Testing.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase, from AI Signal Research Inc.

The acquisition process is pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

Additionally, the PC-SIGNAL® software and ASRI technical support are required immediately in order for NASA to perform the required analysis, in an accurate and timely manner, for the imminent Shuttle Flowliner testing activities.  Therefore, ASRI is the only source available to meet the analysis and processing requirements set forth by the Flowliner activities.    The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-19. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541519 NAICS CODE AND $21M respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

JOB DESCRIPTION:

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The Alternative Development Advisor serves in the Agriculture and Alternative Development Office (AADO), USAID/Colombia, Bogota and is supervised by the Office Director.  The contractor serves as principal advisor to senior USAID and US Embassy staff on alternative development strategy and program implementation.  Additional responsibilities include leading and coordinating USAID and the Government of Colombia (GOC) efforts in the development of a comprehensive alternative development strategy, and in the identification and implementation of private sector led alternative development (AD) opportunities in areas under the pressures of illicit crops.  These activities support Mission's Strategic Objective 2 (SO2) -- Promote economic and social alternatives to illicit crop production. 
The contractor will serve as the key AADO team member responsible for overall planning, tracking and adjustments in AAD program level financial resources.  As such, he/she interacts with Senior Mission Management, Program Office, Office Director and Financial Management offices on program resource management and allocation. 
The contractor will be responsible for the management of several high-profile alternative development programs, with a total portfolio in excess of $26 million.  Currently, these activities include the $ 20 million Colombia Agribusiness Partnership Program, our flagship private sector alternative development activity; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the U.S.G’s primary program with the United Nations on alternative development and monitoring of illicit crop cultivation in Colombia; and the Interamerican Institute for Agricultural Cooperation.
The contractor will have substantial experience in strategic design and management of alternative development programs and will apply his/her expertise to the highly visible, risky and complex alternative development context of Colombia.  This requires the contractor to interact at the highest levels with Colombian officials involved in Plan Colombia.  
The contractor will work as a member of the AADO team and will collaborate with individuals from other USAID teams and other Embassy units involved in Plan Colombia activities.
The contractor will have experience working with USAID-funded activities and will have solid knowledge of USAID implementation and documentation requirements and operational procedures.  Given this experience, the contractor will provide guidance to less experienced members of the AADO team.
The contractor will have overseas experience working in alternative development and economic growth in difficult politically sensitive environments, which require astute skills in diplomacy and flexibility.

<DESC>Defense Sciences Research and Technology; SOL: BAA03-02; POC: Dr. Steven G. Wax, DARPA/DSO; FAX: (571) 218-4553; WEB:http://www.darpa.mil/baa/; E-MAIL: BAA03-02@darpa.mil.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING.  The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency?s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.  To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below.  Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.  Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Likewise, proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success.  This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO.  This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  However, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal.  (See below)  New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing and Devices: Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Biomaterials and biomimetic materials; Engineered materials (meta-materials); Fracture phenomena and prognostics; Femtosecond Laser Diodes and Optical Amplifiers; Functional materials (ferroelectric, magnetic, etc.); Materials and concepts for advanced (beyond silicon) electronic materials and devices; Materials and concepts for power generation and energy storage at all scales; Materials and structures for quantum information processing; Materials and structures for spin transport and control; Multifunctional (structure + function) materials; Non-destructive evaluation, property/life prediction and related technologies; Novel approaches for materials discovery, processing or manufacturing and insertion; Optical materials; Self-healing, -sensing and -adapting materials; and Smart materials and structures. Advanced Mathematics: Application of advanced mathematics to problems of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD): Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Computational geometry and topology; Dimensionality reduction, error propagation and uncertainty management in databases, models, and experiments; Electromagnetic modeling and simulation; Fast, scalable scientific computation; Quantum information science; Sensor management; Signal and image processing; and Virtual materials development, processing, and evaluation. Biological Warfare Defense: Technologies to render biological warfare attacks against the U.S. military harmless:  Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Advanced medical diagnostics; External protection (clothing, masks, etc.) for soldiers; Medical countermeasures against both known and unknown pathogens; Protection, decontamination of materials and equipment; Remote detection / characterization of biological substances; Self-decontamination concepts; and Sensor technology.  Applications of Biology to Defense Applications: Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Accelerating the healing response of tissue; Approaches for controlling biological systems; Approaches for enhancing human performance; Biodynamics and Biological Complexity; Bio-inspired systems; Biomaterials/bioprocessing; Biomolecular motors and devices; Cell and tissue based biosensors; Hybrid biotic/abiotic systems; Human performance enhancement (including training) technologies; Investigation of the behavior of biointerfaces; Novel mathematical and computational approaches to characterizing and simulating complex biological processes; and Understanding sensory cognitive mechanisms affecting spatial orientation. Special Focus Areas.  From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  Due to the expected large volume of interested parties, it will not be possible for DARPA to establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.  Other Technical Areas: Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of the Defense Sciences Office and are likely to be rejected.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES.  Proposals may be submitted at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00pm ET 7 November 2003.  Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation and within 30 days of receipt an offeror will be notified either that: 1) the proposal has been selected for funding; 2) the proposal has not been selected for funding; or 3) the proposal is still under review and an estimate of when this review will be completed will be provided.  Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process.  If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired.  One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).  White Paper Submissions.  Before proposers put together a full proposal it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state-of-the-art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that the proposal will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities.  Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.
Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their proposal to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a white paper document in (format).  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA03-02@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note: if the website is not used, then the body of the e-mail AND the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will be informed of receipt of the white paper, provided a proposal log number and given both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a formal proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  Please note, this recommendation is for the benefit of the proposer and is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.  White papers may be submitted at any time.  However, proposers should leave sufficient time for technical interactions before the due date of the full proposals, November 7, 2003.  FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSAL.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes, technical and cost.  Offerors should submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the full proposal to the address shown below.  For full proposals, facsimile transmissions or electronic media transmissions will not be accepted.  All pages shall be printed on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point and a minimum of one and one-half spacing.  This includes the type on figures and charts.  Copies of up to three papers referenced in the proposal may be included with the submission, but will be read at the discretion of the reviewers.  Proposers are cautioned not to count on these papers in meeting the evaluation criteria described below.  All other supporting materials including videotapes and CDs submitted with the proposal will be disregarded.  Volume 1: Technical.  The technical volume is limited to a maximum of 30 pages including all figures, references, tables, charts, cover sheet, and appendices and consists of the following sections: (a) Executive Summary (two pages or less); (b) Technical section that clearly describes the innovation of the work to be accomplished, specific metrics for the effort, the risks to achieving those metrics and approaches for mitigation of those risks.

Teaming and Team Composition.  Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.  Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified.  The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and to join others in submitting proposals.  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Consequently, all offerors and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA), or similar support, to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  Technology Transition.  Proposers are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers from the program inception.  The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military.  Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research.  This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation.  Proprietary Information.  All proprietary information should be marked on both the white paper and the full proposal.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with DARPA, unless the specific phrase ?TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY? appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes.  Security.  Proposals and white papers may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI).  Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals above DoD SECRET should contact DARPA security at the address identified in this BAA (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation.  DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED WHITE PAPERS BY EMAIL.  Offerors must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance.  Proposals that are considered less than satisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further.  Scientific and Technical Merit.  Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks.  A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art must be demonstrated.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.  Value to Defense.  Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change military capability or improve national security with a clear statement of the goals of their program and a quantitative comparison with existing technology.  Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort.  Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.  Cost Realism.  Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.  ADMINISTRATION.  Address for Submission of White Papers or Full Proposals (Except Classified Proposals): DARPA/DSO, ATTN: BAA03-02, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  Web address for White Paper Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso/.  Guidance for Classified Information and Data.  Proposers should contact the Contracting Officer for information on security or for instructions for the submission of a classified proposal.  All Other Correspondence: Fax:  (571) 218-4553 (Addressed to: DARPA/DSO, BAA03-02), Electronic Mail: BAA03-02@darpa.mil.

<SOLNBR>DAAE30-03-Q-0608
<RESPDATE>070803
<CONTACT>Kendra Archbald,
<DESC>The Government is planning a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition to qualify the production lot performance of an Elvax coated M206 infrared flare. The mositure-resistant Elvax coating formulation and processing technique are the result of a two-year R&D effort performed by the Pyro Systems group at TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. This Statement of Work (SOW) proposes the production of approximately four hundred fifty (450) Magnesium-Teflon-Elvax (MTE) formulated M206 flares at an existing M206 infrared flare production contractor facility. The MTE flares produced will be subjected to the standard M206 first article tests by the contractor. The remaining flares will be sent to ARDEC and OO-ALC/WMBA, Hill Air Force Base. ARDEC will confirm static infrared output, velocity performanc and efficacy of ELVAX in reduction of hydrogen outgassing. OO-ALC/WMBA will flight test the MTE flares to confirm performance equivalent to the standard M206. The results of this SOW effort can be applied to similar magnesium based infrared flare formulations. Upon successful completion of this program, a follow on effort will be initiated to incorporate the MTE formulation into the M206 Technical Data Package.  A limited source negotiation is contemplated with Kilgore Flare Company LLC, and BAE Systems Integrated Defense Solutions, Inc, in accordance with FAR 6.302-3(b)(v) because it is necessary to maintain the required domestic capability for production of critical supplies by limiting competition to items manufactured in the United States or the the United States and Canada. The solicitation will be available for downloading from http://procnet.pica.army.mil approximately forty-five days from the  publication of this notice. See numbered notes 13 and 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is publishing this Synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.203 (Publicizing Contract Actions), and FAR 13.105 (Simplified Acquisitions).  This Synopsis/Solicitation is a sole source purchase to Hart Publications, as a joint-venture sponsorship between Hart Publications, Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory.  This purchase is for the publication of a quarterly, technical journal entitled GasTIPS.  Hart Publications will produce and mail three issues of GasTIPS during calendar year 2004, and fourth issue between December 2004 and February 2005.  The cost sharing opportunity with this joint venture between Hart Publications, GTI and the Department of Energy allows the government a substantial cost savings for the publication of GasTIPS. The four issues of GasTIPS will be mailed to the current mailing list of approximately 9,500 individuals and/or companies.  Hart Publications will mail each issue to Western hemisphere subscribers free of charge.  Hart may charge subscribers for issues mailed to non-Western hemisphere locations. NETL will have the right to provide, on an alternating basis, either three (3) or four (4) technical articles per issue on topics concerning natural gas exploration, production, processing, or related topics.  These articles will be of a length comparable to past GasTIPS articles.  Hart will provide writing and editing assistance to NETL authors as necessary, and NETL will provide information in a timely fashion.  Non-NETL content for each issue of GasTIPS will be provided by other joint sponsors and/or Hart.  NETL submissions will be subject to a final review by NETL before printing.  An editorial calendar and submission schedule will be determined by mutual agreement of the joint sponsors. The Editors' Commentary column in each issue will be developed jointly by Hart and the joint sponsors.  The joint sponsors will approve the column text before publication. Hart will supply to NETL, in PDF format, all articles that appear in each issue, for publication on the NETL website, on or shortly after the publication date of each issue. If NETL desires, Hart will tip in one 4-page (or less) insert into any issue, providing that NETL supplies the insert to Hart's printer in a timely fashion prior to the mailing date.  Hart may permit other joint sponsors to provide inserts and/or use the mailing list in ways deemed appropriate by the joint sponsors. Hart will provide to NETL an additional 75 copies of each issue, shipped to a single domestic U.S. location specified by NETL. (This will be the NETL library in Morgantown, WV, unless otherwise directed by NETL.) NETL can obtain additional copies at cost if sufficient notice is given prior to printing.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public Architectural-Engineering for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Phase services for the John Minor Wisdom U. S. Court of Appeals Building in New Orleans, Louisiana. This procurement is set-aside for small business concerns.  NAICS code for this procurement is 541310, $ 4 million. The John Minor Wisdom building is located at 600 Camp Street in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana. It was completed in 1915 as the city’s main post office and Federal courthouse. It served the public with these functions for almost 50 years. Since 1972 the Fifth Circuit U.S Court of Appeals has occupied the building. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The three-story building provides 246,280 gross square feet for approximately 172 employees. Parking is provided in the basement for 50 vehicles.  GSA proposes to replace vital building systems that have exceeded their life expectancy and are critical to the safe and efficient operation of the building. Modifications to the electrical system will include replacement of transformers and panel boards. Upgrades to the mechanical components of the HVAC system include replacement of air handling units, rezoning ductwork, reworking of HVAC controls, and pipe and duct asbestos abatement. Plumbing system modifications include replacement of fixtures and the domestic water system. Architectural work will include renewing corridor and stair finishes, renovating toilet rooms, and providing handicapped signage, telephones, and drinking fountains.   GSA Greater Southwest Region, Solicitation No. GS-07P-04-UUC-1003. The Estimated Construction Cost range is between 5 to 10 million dollars.  Designed by the distinguished New York architectural firm of Hale and Rogers, the Wisdom Court of Appeals Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.  It is an imposing, monumental structure, one of the most significant in New Orleans.  The building occupies an entire city block; its white marble exterior is a well proportioned example of Italian Renaissance revival architecture.  Each of the building’s four corners is treated architecturally as a pavilion, including a large distinctive sculpture group at the top, known as the “Ladies”.  The unique aspects of the architecture of this period should be considered. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS). The design shall include sustainable features. The design shall also include the GSA design standards for secure facilities. The building will be completely occupied during the construction phase. Therefore the design shall be phased so that the tenants can complete their mission without interruption. This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to Newton Associates, 21 Old Granary Court, Catonsville, Maryland 21228.  The purpose of this contract is two-fold:  (1) to procure expert services to assist CMS staff in planning, prioritizing, and conducting all data analyses relevant to developing proposed and final rules for the OPPS for 2005; and, (2) to procure expert services to prepare CMS staff to assume full responsibility beginning with the 2006 OPPS update for every aspect of planning, prioritizing, and conducting the data analyses necessary for the annual OPPS updates, and to transition management of the OPPS data programs and standard analytic data files to permanent CMS staff. The contractor would perform the following tasks for the 2005 OPPS update and provide advice and guidance in transitioning these tasks to CMS staff for future updates:
1.	Assist in coordinating all activities related to incorporating new policy decisions into rate calculations and impact analyses.
2.	Provide quality assurance and oversight of all activities related to analyses needed for publication of the OPPS proposed and final rules for 2005, including construction of addenda and public use files.
3.	Provide advice and assistance in coordinating individual and group tasks needed to generate work products.
4.	Develop specifications and data requirements to construct a standard analytical file for annual update of OPPS and policy analysis.
5.	Develop the approach and processes needed to evaluate data obtained from secondary sources to evaluate the clinical integrity of specific payment groups and relative payment weights.
6.	Provide advice related to methods for renovating current programming to maximize efficient and accurate data processing.
7.	Evaluate and assess reasonableness of final results within the context of discretionary and statutory policies and requirements.
8.	Assist in developing processes to ensure thorough documentation of analytical files and related policy decisions that underlie the proposed and final OPPS rules.
The hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) is new and complex.  It has been made even more complex by legislative changes enacted in 2003 that will affect the 2005 update.  Updating the OPPS for 2005 in accordance with statutory mandates and policy refinements implemented in the 2004 update requires the assistance of a contractor with extensive knowledge and experience in performing Medicare systems analyses combined with a thorough familiarity with the data and rate setting models that were the basis of prior OPPS updates.  To ensure that accurate data are captured for the OPPS update requires expert knowledge of the claims processing format and system as well policy determinations made for the 2004 update related to the use of external data and special provisions implemented in 2003 related to payments for drugs, biologicals, and devices that will affect construction of the data set for the 2005 update.  Marilyn Newton (registered as “Newton Associates”) possesses the experience, knowledge, and expertise that are required for this project.  She has over 30 years of experience with Medicare payment systems that she acquired as a CMS employee.  For 26 of these years, she performed research, systems analyses, and data development for various payment systems including the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system and the physician fee schedule.  During a substantial number of those years, she planned, prioritized, and directed the work of a large staff responsible for completing such tasks.  As a result of this work, Ms. Newton has acquired in-depth knowledge of Medicare data reporting requirements and claims processing.  She has vast knowledge and experience with the various systems through which Medicare bills are processed and the types of edits applied to each system.  She has expert knowledge of the Claims Expansion/Line Items Processing (CELIP), which hospitals are required to use to bill for outpatient services paid under the OPPS, and the software that is used to edit and pay these claims.  She has considerable experience with and knowledge of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) that is required for OPPS billing and used to construct the OPPS analytical data files.  In 1999, Ms. Newton assisted in completing the system analyses and data modeling that resulted in the successful implementation of the new OPPS on August 1, 2000.  Ms. Newton has provided invaluable support in modifying the OPPS analytical files to incorporate new policy decisions and requirements for the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 OPPS updates. Ms. Newton’s extensive experience in working with the OPPS analytical files and programs coupled with her extensive past experience as a leader in resolving policy issues, constructing appropriate data files, and coordinating the programming needed for the OPPS updates for 2001 through 2004, amplify her importance in successfully updating the OPPS for 2005.  Her expert services are essential to assist a team of policy analysts in identifying the data elements, files, and programming that require modification; to analyze and resolve policy issues related to such modifications; to coordinate the programming that incorporates policy changes; to calculate payment rates and relative weights; to develop impact analyses; to construct all addenda and related public use files for the 2005 proposed and final rules; to renovate programs for maximum efficiency in data processing; and to implement appropriate data file documentation.  In addition, CMS is assuming fuller responsibility beginning with the 2005 OPPS update for every aspect of planning and conducting the data analyses necessary for the annual OPPS updates.  Because Ms. Newton was primarily responsible for these tasks for the 2001-2004 OPPS updates, her services are essential to continue the transition of coordination of the OPPS data programs and standard analytic data files to permanent CMS staff.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with Illinois officials, requires three (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) within the State of Illinois.  The first contract will cover the Chicago area, the second and third contract will cover Park Ridge (for Ravenwood with Damen Avenue as the east/west dividing line).  The application is intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 86,301 (+- 20%) trees and an estimated total DBH of 968,879 (+/- 20%) inches, as follow:

Chicago, West Ravenswood:  23,240 trees at 329,824 total DBH by soil injection
				   5,292 trees at   42,345 total DBH by trunk injection
Chicago, East Ravenswood:   23,830 trees at 319,017 total DBH by soil injection
				  1,178 trees at   14,589 total DBH by trunk injection
Park Ridge, Forest Preserve:  31,780 trees at 246,626 total DBH by trunk injection
Park Ridge, Residential Area:     981 trees at   16,478 total DBH by trunk injection.  THE SOLICITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE POSTED BY COB FEBRUARY 2, 2004, WITH PROPOSALS DUE TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOUR WEEKS THEREAFTER.  The effective period of the contract will be from date of award through September 30, 2004, WITH FOUR UNILATERAL OPTION YEARS.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.

<DESC>DARPA INITIATIVE IN PROGNOSIS, SOL BAA03-02, Addendum 1, 
DUE 03/17/03, POC: DR. LEO CHRISTODOULOU, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4553, Email: baa03-02@darpa.mil URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.  PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in receiving proposals for research, development and demonstration of a prognosis system for real time or near-real time asset capability prediction, with specific emphasis on materials and structures.  The vision of the prognosis system is to provide military commanders the data and quantitative performance predictions to adaptively manage, deploy, and use individual combat systems to the limit of their current capability.  The objective of the program is to create a tool for predicting near-term system capability including imminent failure, without the need for any inspection or maintenance action.  Critical elements of such a prognosis system include; a.)  early sensing, warning, interpretation and prediction of significant deviations from normal operational parameters including warning of imminent failure independent of normal inspection, maintenance schedules and procedures, b.)  techniques for establishing state awareness in large, complex machinery and structures, detecting, tracking and predicting evolution of damage using all available techniques with particular emphasis on signature deconvolution, feature extraction, innovative sensor technology and sophisticated reasoning methodologies for future capability prediction, c.)  universal methodologies into which system/platform and material-specific modules can be incorporated as required, and d.)  common and open data structures that enable new and emerging models, materials and sensors from a variety of sources to be incorporated into the prognosis system as their maturity allows.  PROGRAM CONTENT:  This program aims to develop the constituent technologies that enable the critical elements above and to demonstrate these elements in an integrated prognosis system designed for a specific challenge problem (e.g., wing structure, turbine disk).  Technical issues to be addressed include; 1.)  physics of failure models in materials under complex and varying conditions, 2) damage accumulation and evolution in materials and structures induced by multiple and interacting damage and failure mechanisms, 3) stochastic and probabilistic effects in materials, 4.)  innovative sensor technologies needed to detect incipient and advancing damage, 5.)  means for evaluating uncertainties and error estimation for both models predictions and sensor data, 6.)  techniques for establishing state awareness in large, complex machinery and structures and for detecting, tracking and predicting evolution of damage using all available techniques (autonomic system interrogation, local and global sensors, signature deconvolution, feature extraction, etc.), 7.)  reasoning methodologies for future capability prediction and 8) a robust prognosis system architecture that includes safeguards to limit false positive and false negative predictions and presents the appropriate data/predictions to relevant military commanders (weapon system operators, local/unit commanders at various levels, fleet commanders, maintenance engineers, etc.).  Proposers may address additional prognosis technologies deemed critical to the prognosis program not listed here.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, simulations, and other research activities planned in each of the seven technical issues listed above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18 month technical objectives (?go/no-go? milestones) for each of the technical issues that clearly demonstrate the program is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, and 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths.  Specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of technology elements are required periodically, and a final ?blind? demonstration of the entire prognosis system is required at the end of the program.  Proposals should include identification and assessment of critical technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged.  Proposed efforts should not exceed forty-eight months.  If proposals include use of Government facilities, offerers will be expected to conclude commercial services arrangements with the providing government facility.  Offerer teaming with DoD government activities for R&D efforts other than facility use is discouraged.  It is anticipated that the results of any DARPA-funded directly-related R&D efforts conducted by Government organizations will be provided to all offerers who receive awards under this BAA.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 03-02 dated December 16, 2002.  To receive consideration under this addendum proposals are due no later than 1600 ET March 17, 2003, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA, but not this addendum.  EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: Evaluation of the proposals will be based on the following criteria, in decreasing order of importance: 1) the scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort as they address the program requirements listed above, 2) the likelihood that the proposed development will provide unique and/or new capabilities for the DoD, 3) the qualifications of the key personnel, and adequacy of the equipment and facilities to meet the objectives, and 4) cost realism.  Proposers may be asked to present their proposal in person to an evaluation committee.  A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  Evaluation and selection of proposals for award will be made to those offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Technology Investment Agreement (TIA)," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227) Because of the specific nature of this solicitation, no portion of this program will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation.  However, these organizations are encouraged to team with other proposers.  GENERAL INFORMATION: In all correspondence, reference BAA03-02, Addendum 1.  Proposals will not be returned.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.  All support contractors are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as "GOVERNMENT ONLY."  For general administrative questions and proposal formatting, please refer to the original FEDBIZOPPS announcement for BAA03-02 dated December 16, 2002.

URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso, SPECIAL FOCUS AREA: MOBILE INTEGRATED SUSTAINABLE ENERGY RECOVERY (MISER). PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is soliciting innovative research proposals for the development and demonstration of novel, high-efficiency Mobile Integrated Sustainable Energy Recovery (MISER) technologies.  These technologies are defined as methods by which the energy content of packaging waste, specifically plastic packaging can be rapidly and efficiently converted to a viable fuel for in-the-field electric power generation.  The U.S. military land-based operations of the future are intended to be self-sustaining and must minimize long logistics tails.  Units engaged in stationary field operations generate substantial quantities of solid waste in the form of packaging materials.  Personnel, fuel, and critical transport equipment are needed to support the removal and disposal of these large volumes of packaging waste.  The quantities involved today (estimated to be over 7 lb/day/soldier) can potentially overwhelm the capacity of foreign nations waste disposal systems creating health concerns, security issues, and possible future liabilities.  Reduction of packaging waste through reduction of packaging use is not likely to be attainable at any significant level due to health, security, and operation requirements.  Alternative solutions are required.  Plastic packaging waste has energy content that can approach that of diesel fuel. Diesel fuel has lower heating value of 43.9MJ/kg with a hydrogen content of 12.5 weight percent. Plastic heating values can range from 26-43MJ/kg with a hydrogen content of 5-14 percent.  If the energy content of the waste is optimized for secondary use as a fuel source, at today’s level of discarded packaging, a military unit could achieve well over 100 percent self-sufficiency for their generator fuel needs.  The challenge is to develop a technology that can efficiently harness the energy content of a plastic-based packaging waste stream in the field and do so in a timely manner. Successful development of a MISER unit would increase the availability of power-when-needed in the field while simultaneously zeroing the logistics waste footprint.  Known technologies include gasification and pyrolysis.  These tend to be energy intensive, very inefficient, and leave significant byproduct that requires disposal.  In addition, the technologies capture only a small part of the energy content of waste.  It is the intent of this BAA to solicit proposals that only consider revolutionary advancements in waste-to-fuel conversion technologies. The goal of this program is to explore the possibility of achieving nearly complete plastic packaging waste reduction while harnessing 90 percent of the packaging energy content for use in electricity generation.  Since trends indicate that future military packaging will be plastic-based, proposals must make their primary focus the conversion of plastic waste.  Two types of plastic waste will be considered:  petroleum-based plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene mix) or the recently developed bioplastics (plastics made from non-petroleum sources).  Performers must specify the type of waste they intend to convert. The proposed MISER program should describe a 36-month effort that is broken down into two 18-month phases. The Phase I milestones for this program are a proof-of-concept that includes: 1) The continuous conversion of a standardized (1/3 each of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene), pre-shredded plastic waste to fuel at a rate of  8.2 lbs/hr minimum with no more than 10 percent unconverted, solid residue.  
2) Demonstration that the fuel created can produce 24 hours of continuous power generation using a specified commercial-off-the-shelf 5 kW generator.  (Note: 8.2 lbs/hr assumes capturing 70 percent of the energy from the plastic and a fuel product that is at least 70 percent as efficient as JP-8 in a generator.  If the generation of hydrogen is the target fuel, continuous power generation using an identified 5kW PEM fuel cell must be achieved).  3) Demonstration that the process can be scaled to meet the goals of Phase II.  The Phase II requirements are a portable, integrated, packaged prototype that can generate 5 kW electric power for one week by converting 6.5 lbs/hr actual plastic waste (90 percent energy capture).  The size of the MISER unit must be sufficient to be transported on a standard, three-fourths of a ton, two-axel trailer. There are several technical challenges that will need to be addressed in order to successfully develop and demonstrate a mobile, sustainable, waste-to-fuel technology.  These include: a) utilizing only the energy content of the waste to fuel the process, b) minimizing the generation of solid residue to less than 10 percent of input and, c) producing a quality fuel that can continuously run a generator or a fuel cell, d) scaling the MISER unit for portability.  The successful proposal must detail the plan for running the waste-to-fuel conversion process that minimizes the amount of additional energy needed to perform the conversion.  It is expected that start-up of the process will require some external power; however, continuous operation should be self-sustaining.  The proposal must discuss the mass and energy balance and the minimization of the solid plastic-based residue production from the process. (Note: plastic packaging today is known to contain inorganic fillers, and this issue need not be addressed.)  Because the quality of the fuel is important in generating electrical power, a sufficient understanding of the anticipated fuel quality and how it can be tailored to meet the generator needs must be included. Since this program does not wish to concentrate on generator improvement, the metrics of this program have taken into account the possibility that the performance of the generator may decrease.  The performer must demonstrate that the fuel the proposed MISER process generates is reasonably suitable for sustained generator use.  The MISER unit is expected to be utilized in the field therefore both size and weight represents important parameters that must be addressed.   In determining the success of Phase I, size and weight are not critical factors, however they will be important in the Phase II effort. When describing the process details, the following parameters must be clearly spelled out: 1) Mass of fuel out per mass of waste in [kg/kg]; 2) Fuel lower heating value [MJ/kg]; 3) Parasitic energy requirements (electrical and thermal) per mass of waste in [kJ/kg]; 4) Residence time for waste in the reaction zone. If requested by the Government, it is expected that proof-of-concept deliverables will be made available for testing by an independent laboratory that will be selected by the Government.  Finally, as part of the Phase I deliverable, proposers are to provide detailed technology optimization and prototype design plans for proceeding to the Phase II deliverable of a prototype device that meets or exceeds the program goals for power generation.  The results of the Phase I proof-of-concept will serve as a go/no-go decision point for continuing the effort.   The final deliverable of any project funded under the MISER program is expected to be a mobile waste-to-fuel unit integrated with a 5 kW generator or fuel cell.  The independent laboratory selected by the Government will verify this performance.  TEAMING. Success in Mobile Integrated Sustainable Energy Recovery is dependent on the formation of a well-managed, interdisciplinary team that should possess the necessary theoretical, engineering, polymer, fuel, power generation, thermal management, design, and the experimental expertise required to accomplish their proposed research.  There are no definitive requirements for the types of institutions (industry, university, etc.) that make up any particular team.  Members of the interdisciplinary teams will be required to work collaboratively, and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the objectives. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS. White Papers are not sought for this addendum.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than, 4:00PM (ET), January 16, 2004.

<DESC>TIME REVERSAL METHODS, SOL BAA 03-02, Addendum 3, DUE 051403, POC:  DR. CAREY SCHWARTZ, DARPA/DSO, Fax:  571-218-4553, E-mail: baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso.  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new research for TIME REVERSAL METHODS.  This new program represents a thrust area for DSO that will comprise a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach with far reaching impact.  Time Reversal Methods: Active and passive sensor systems often receive signals that include contributions derived from multipath scattering effects.  Systems effected by multipath include, for example, active acoustic, sonar, LADAR, and radar modalities including synthetic aperture, inverse synthetic aperture, and over the horizon.  Further the ability to obtain imagery through foliage and other types of clutter impacts the ability to detect and recognize targets.  Conventional approaches to obtaining imagery in the presence of clutter rely on utilization of wavelengths larger than the scale of the clutter resulting in a spatial resolution that is limited by the long wavelength probe or special timing schemes.  The presence of multipath scattering also strongly affects wireless and acoustic communication systems resulting in suboptimal bandwidth utilization and limited communication capacity as suggested by current research in the area of Multiple Input Multiple Output systems.  Time reversal methods are mathematical approaches to the inverse problem that seek to exploit the presence of multiple scattering that show promise for estimation of channels and the presence of objects within the channel.  Time reversal methods are based in part on the concept of employing a single source and multiple receivers.  A portion of the signal recorded at each receiver is then time reversed, i.e., last in first out, and used to estimate the propagation channel for either communication or imaging.  The predominance of ongoing work in time reversal methods has been directed towards acoustic point targets in low dimensions.  DARPA is interested in creating new technologies for exploiting the presence of multiple scattering in order to obtain high resolution imagery, enhanced communication bandwidth, and potentially covert communication channels.  We would like to invite white papers that are far reaching in their implications, innovative, and ambitious in their goals and implementation.  We encourage the submission of white papers and proposals that address one or more of the following areas: (1) Extension of time reversal methods from the acoustic to electromagnetic domain including the ability to treat three spatial and one temporal dimension, extended targets, and the effects of polarization in a wide variety of multipath environments including the presence of a spatially variable dielectric response.  This will require the creation and exploitation of new models, either statistical or deterministic, of the environment, electromagnetic simulations for the environment, and potentially experiments that validate the models and provide parameters for the models.  (2) Extension of time reversal methods as applied to acoustics to include the ability to treat three spatial and one temporal dimension as well as extended targets in a wide variety of acoustic environments including the presence of a spatially varying speed of sound.  This will require the creation and exploitation of new models, either statistical or deterministic, of the environment, electromagnetic simulations for the environment, and potentially experiments that validate the model and provide needed parameters for the models.  (3) Determination and quantification of the relationship between the amount of multipath and the maximal resolution of a target for the wavelength employed.  System studies that suggest how to modify existing sensors in light of the desired spatial resolution of the target, degree of multipath scattering, and detector noise, as well as suggesting collection stratllenge systems and metrics are described below: (a) Development of non-linear optical materials with Chi 2 on the order of 10 (-3) esu and Chi 3 on the order of  10 (-17) cm squared/volt squared; (b) Development of thin film ferroelectrics with tunability/loss tangent ratio of 100 at 100 GHz and 1000 at 100 GHz; (c) Small proteins for which the computed potential energy of the confirmation in an aqueous environment is accurate to 5 meV; (d) Development of magnetic semiconductors with critical temperatures in excess of 300 K and spin polarization greater than 70%; 
(e) Development of High Energy Density Materials for which Isp exceeds 300 s; 
(f) Development of thermoelectric materials for which the figure of merit ZT is greater than 5; (g) Reversible hydrogen storage material with storage weight percent of 6.5% for fuel cells; (h) Development of a catalyst for selective synthesis of carbon nanotubes by type.  White papers may include any combinations of the above areas.  Although discouraged, authors may propose another material challenge system, but it is incumbent on them to provide supporting information regarding potential Department of Defense applications for the material system, and that the suggested performance goals represent a significant increase in capability.  Submission of white papers that combine developments in mathematics, physics, computational chemistry, and numerical algorithms coupled to optimization and inverse methods, which contain a minimal experimental component to validate the theoretical predictions, and which can be generalized to other challenge systems, are encouraged.  Such white papers are preferred relative to those that focus on experimentation, translation of existing algorithms to parallel or grid computation, or studies that, although addressing a challenge material system, cannot be generalized to other systems.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenging problems.  It is essential that the preparation of white papers include the following areas: (a) A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  While distinct goals for the execution of the proposal are required, the vision presented may extend past the performance period; (b) A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined and measured.  Intermediate milestones of approximately 18 month periods, with demonstrable metrics of performance, must be included for the proposed work; (c) A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed, as well as funding.  A management plan that describes how the different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated is critical; (d) The white paper should consider phases of development as the challenges are met.  The first phase of the program should include theoretical analysis, demonstrating the efficacy of materials design by inverse methods or optimization techniques, coupled to an experimental demonstration. White papers must be received by 1600 ET July 9, 2003.  Please put the phrase PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS in the title of the white paper.  For instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to the instructions for BAA03-02 found at the web site http://www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso/.  Authors of white papers will be notified by August 29, 2003, if a full proposal will be requested.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 ET September 30, 2003.  Notwithstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18-month scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.

<DESC>PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS, SOL BAA 03-02, Addendum 4, DUE 9/30/2003, POC:  DR. CAREY SCHWARTZ, DARPA/DSO, Fax:  571-218-4553, E-mail:  baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL:  www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso. The Defense Sciences Office is interested in new white papers for PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS.  This new program represents a thrust area for DSO that will comprise a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach with far-reaching impact. Predicting Real Optimized Materials (PROM): Existing methods for materials development rely on synthetic methods of either perturbing known material systems or substituting atomic constituents in order to achieve desired properties.  This is costly in terms of labor and time and leaves large portions of the parameter space unexplored.  As a result of computational complexity, theoretical methods are seldom used to suggest new structures or to suggest the substitution of atoms in a structure to achieve the desired physical properties.  Instead, such models are generally only used to calculate various properties of known structures. The desired approach to ab initio materials design is based upon inverse methods where the desired properties are input, and the atoms and their relative placement are computed.  Recent efforts suggest that advances in mathematical techniques that reduce the complexity of ab initio methods, coupled to recent advances in the ab initio methods themselves, supported by ubiquitous compute power, would enable material designers to approach materials as an inverse problem.  Moreover, such an approach would suggest synthesis routes for the materials of interest, while exploring portions of the parameter space heretofore unexplored. PROM intends to develop tools to solve the inverse problem, thereby minimizing the number of experiments that are performed, including synthesis.  We would like to invite white papers that are innovative, far-reaching in their implications, and ambitious in their goals and implementation.  The proposed work should be in one or more of the following areas: (a) Development and application of ab initio methods for the ground state of the many body Schrodinger Equation such as:  Density Functional Theory, Quantum Monte Carlo, ab initio Molecular Dynamics, and related methods of O (N) or better in computational complexity that can account for the presence of external fields, finite temperatures, and other perturbations. Development and application of ab initio methods for the excited states of the many body Schrodinger Equation such as:  Density Functional Theory, Quantum Monte Carlo, ab initio  Molecular Dynamics, and related methods of O(N) or better in computational complexity that can account for the presence of external fields, finite temperatures, and other perturbations; (b) Development and application of methods, systems, and interfaces that automatically extract parameters of interest from microscopic systems and produce parameters of relevance for macroscopic systems; (c) Development and application of algorithmic methods that enable molecular dynamics calculations to be performed across multiple spatial and temporal scales sufficient to model clusters of 100’s of atoms interacting with similar clusters or surface for several microseconds; 
(d) Development and application of methodologies to couple optimization methods with ab initio calculations to support materials design; (e) Development and application of new tools to support quantum chemistry that make use of new representations of electronic orbitals to achieve performance gains in excess of 1000 relative to GAUSSIAN based upon algorithmic improvements only; (f) Coupling of inverse methods to ab initio calculations and application of the hybrid method to automated procedures for material designs. In order to provide focus to the program, we strongly encourage authors of white papers and proposals to apply their techniques to meeting the goals of a challenge system.  A set of proposed chaonly have their anatomic shapes modeled).  The modeling dynamics must be able to respond to a penetrating wound of the heart by predicting the expected response at each level to the wounding forces. (4) Automatic segmentation of organ-tissue systems.  The individual organ-tissue system models (e.g., heart, lung, great vessels, etc.) on the whole-organ level must be automatically derived (segmented) from commercially available imaging modalities (Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), etc.) in a form that can be visually displayed in three dimensions as the organ.  In addition, the database that provides the dataset for automatically storing and displaying the segmented image of the organ must also be capable of storing the data for every property of each organ.  In Phase 1, only the heart will be segmented and stored with the properties described above. (5) Holomer display and interface.   The display of the virtual soldier must bear a high-fidelity resemblance to the real soldier data - for Phase 1, the image of the heart must look exactly like the actual heart (see demonstration below).  In addition, interaction with the display must be absolutely intuitive ¡V manipulating and interacting with the holomer must resemble as close as possible the actions that would be performed on a real person. (6) Holomer storage, retrieval and interoperability.  The dataset for the project must be storable on the U.S. Army Personnel Information Carrier (PIC or ¡§electronic dog tag¡¨).  This data must be able to be transferred to a number of platforms and medical records (open architecture) to include the medic hand-held computer, standard laptop, standard desktop personal computer, DoD hospital-based medical record and Veterans Administration (VA) electronic medical record. (7) Demonstration.   There will be a single demonstration that meets not only the individual project milestones, but also the integration of the individual projects into a unified program.  Since the success of the Phase 1 depends upon the successful prediction of outcomes, each of the components will not be considered successful unless the entire demonstration succeeds; therefore consensus of operating standards and interface methodology and continuous interaction among the participants is required. The demonstration that will be conducted in18 months to prove the validity of the virtual soldier (holomer) concept will be in a porcine model of an event from the Wound Data and Munitions Effectiveness Team (WDMET) database.  After a CT scan of the porcine chest, the anatomic model of the heart (and representational models of the chest wall, lung, great vessels and aorta) will be derived through automatic segmentation and the properties (on the properties-levels agreed upon) will be added to only the heart database. This will be stored on a PIC.  The selected event will be initiated, and there will be continuous monitoring until completion of protocol.  There will be two model comparisons made, which must have at least a p> 0.80 correlation:  1) The structural abnormalities of the modeled heart must predict the actual anatomic abnormalities documented at protocol completion and 2) The physiologic response of the event model of the cardiovascular system must follow and predict the actual recording of the same parameters during the demonstration of the event. The submission formatting and requirements of the master BAA 03-02 are to be considered in addition to the guidelines provided herein.  The minimum requested for your proposal to this Addendum is:  Part I -  Technical  1)Problem definition ¡V in one-two paragraphs state clearly what problem you will solve;  2) Previous experience/success in the specific subject matter area (component) ¡V maximum one page;  3) Technical Solution Summary of your innovative solution to the problem, including how you will integrate with the other component areas ¡V no more than two pages;  4) Tasks ¡V simply list (in outline form) the tasks that will be performed (listed as Task 1, 2  etc.) with subtasks and the last subtask as a specific deliverable; 5) Statement of Work (SOW) ¡V for each Task listed above, describe the problem to be solved, how you will solve the problem and what are the possible barriers to success ¡V this is the technical description of the work which will primarily determine the acceptability of the proposal (images and diagrams are encouraged);  6) Timeline graph ¡V listing both the milestones and deliverables;  7)  Facilities/equipment ¡V very brief one or two paragraph description of resources;   8)  Personnel qualifications - of the PI and major participants (maximum of 2 pages each).  You may list (with a one sentence description) any advisors/consultants that bring unique qualifications, however no curriculum vitae should be included.  Part II - Budget.  Proposers must submit an original and 4 hard copies of the full proposal plus two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal in PDF - preferred, though MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single CD-ROM, 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskettes, or 100 MB Iomega Zip„µ disks will be accepted. Each proposal and disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-02, addendum 4 ¡V The Virtual Soldier, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended).  Submissions of full proposals via electronic mail (e-mail) will not be accepted.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/DSO, (Attn.: BAA 03-02 ¡V The Virtual Soldier), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 on or before 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time (ET), April 30, 2003, in order to be considered under this addendum.  Proposals received after that date may be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.
All proprietary information should be clearly marked on the full proposal. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with DARPA, unless the specific phrase "TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY" appears on the cover sheet.

<DESC>METABOLIC DOMINANCE, BAA 03-02, Addendum 2, DUE 041703, POC: DR. JOSEPH T. BIELITZKI, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4553, Email: baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso. PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:  The Defense Sciences Office is interested in proposals to develop innovative science and technology capable of affording superior physiological qualities to the warfighter.  The vision for the Metabolic Dominance Program is to develop novel strategies that exploit and control the mechanisms of energy production, metabolism, and utilization during short periods of deployment requiring unprecedented levels of physical demand.  The ultimate goal is to enable superior physical and physiological performance by controlling energy metabolism on demand.  An example is continuous peak physical performance and cognitive function for 3 to 5 days, 24 hours per day, without the need for calories.  Continuous exertion over numerous days is currently limited by: 1) the ability to transport and ingest adequate calories and/or effectively access stored calories (e.g., adipose, glycogen); 2) available training time; extended training periods are required to adapt muscle and mitochondria to meet intense physical loads; and 3) the ability of physiological systems to rapidly recover after extended, repeated bouts of physical exertion.  Metabolic Dominance (MD) is a two phase program.  Phase 1 will establish proof-of-concept for four integrated areas of emphasis that together address methods for enhancing soldier performance.  These areas of emphasis focus on: 1) optimizing metabolic performance by developing an understanding of how to control substrate availability and remove metabolic waste products; 2) controlling the thermal environment where energy metabolism occurs; 3) regulating the number and efficiency of cells and organelles necessary for energy production; and 4) identifying the cause of fatigue and, thus, short- or long-term performance degradation.  Phase 2 will provide specific expanded deliverables based on the successful completion of Phase 1.  Proposals responding to this BAA should describe an 18-month Phase 1 effort focused on one or more of the areas of emphasis described below.  Although Phase 2 proposals will be requested at a later date, proposers should clearly indicate what their Phase 2 goals would be and how their 18-month milestones in Phase 1 would lead to the success of those goals.  Phase I proposals should address one or more of the following areas of emphasis: 1) METABOLIC OPTIMIZATION: The warfighter cannot consume adequate calories to sustain metabolic needs over short, intense periods of deployment.  This area seeks concepts for increasing substrate availability to tissues important for strength and endurance, including, but not limited to, proposals investigating: a) methods and mechanisms for rapidly inducing a switch from carbohydrate metabolism to lipolysis as a sustainable source of cellular energy; b) the development of an idealized and customized program for nutritionally preloading the warfighter to facilitate the metabolic transition to lipolysis, c) the development of nutriceuticals or natural products that provide demonstrable benefit for maintaining strength and endurance; d) methods and mechanisms to increase oxygen and metabolite availability to selected tissues, to increase the rate and/or the efficiency of energy metabolism, and/or to provide supplemental high energy phosphates to targeted populations of cells; e) methods and mechanisms to remove or control accumulated metabolic byproducts and/or reactive oxygen species. A key 18-month milestone for the MD Program is demonstration of the ability to selectively regulate the metabolic source of calories on demand, that is, the ability to control the switch from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism, and reverse, for energy production.  Key milestones for the end of Phase 2 include the ability to selectively regulate the metabolic energy source; as well

<DESC>THE VIRTUAL SOLDIER, SOL BAA 03-02, Addendum 4, DUE 043003, POC: DR. RICHARD SATAVA, DARPA/DSO, Fax: (571) 218-4629, Email: baa03-02@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/baa/#dso. THE VIRTUAL SOLDIER Program represents a DSO thrust area that will comprise a multi-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach to establish a new capability that will revolutionize medical care to support the soldier.  The program will create the mathematical modeling approaches to develop an information (computational) representation of an individual soldier (a holographic medical electronic representation or holomer) that can be used to augment medical care on and off the battlefield with a new level of integration.  This virtual soldier will be based upon a highly complex model that is derived from biologically driven principles and populated with properties that are extracted from evidence-based data.  The initial Phase 1 effort will consist of a two-component, three-dimensionally displayed model, 1) An Organ-tissue System model component and; 2) a Properties Level model component.  Once derived, the virtual soldier will provide multiple capabilities, including but not limited to automatic diagnosis of battlefield injuries (this Phase 1), prediction of soldier performance, testing and evaluation of non-lethal weapons, and virtual clinical trials.  In order to create a virtual soldier, integrated, inter-disciplinary teaming will be necessary; proposers are welcome to submit a single institution or multi-institution, multi-disciplinary proposal that covers one or several of the components.  All researchers in this virtual solider program are expected to collaborate extensively with other participants during the DARPA sponsored meetings and throughout the development toward the single demonstration (see below), in order to integrate the technologies and meet the program goals.  The following areas are required in order to construct a holomer and conduct the Phase 1 demonstration: (1) Global Architecture ¡V A generalizable, scalable ontology to characterize the holomer and provide the architecture that will be the infrastructure that integrates all other components (organ-tissue system model and properties-level model).  The milestone will be an architecture with descriptors for each major organ/system that assigns attributes to each system, incorporates all levels of properties (genetic, molecular, biochemical, cellular, physiologic, organ, tissue and whole body) and provides inter-operable cross-linkages from level to level and system to system. (2) Organ-tissue system model component.  This model component will consist of the different organs and tissue systems (e.g., heart, lung, liver, etc.) that need to be modeled and integrated at each level (see below).  Because of the enormous complexity of the human body, the organ systems to be modeled in this Phase 1 will be certain individual organs of the chest cavity, specifically the chest wall, heart, great vessels, lung and aorta; subsequent Phases will address other organs and tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, hemopoetic, lymphatic, etc.) systems.  The milestone will be a full 3-D representation of the chest cavity with segmented heart, great vessels, lung and aorta of a generic model (visible human dataset is acceptable) which is fully interactive for display, query and modeling of a penetrating injury of each of the structures. (3) Properties-levels model.  These models will consist of the different levels of representation (genetic, molecular, cellular, physiologic, organ or total body) that must be modeled within each organ-tissue system.  For Phase 1 (to add properties to the heart only) the levels to be modeled may include the cellular, molecular (biochemical), physiologic (including electrophysiology, mechanics, hemodynamics, etc.) and total organ structure.  Excluded are genetic, tissue and cardio-vascular system (only the heart is to be modeled with properties, the remainder of organs mentioned above will

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the BAA03-02 Response Date from November 7, 2003 (11/07/03) to January 16, 2004 (01/16/2004).as identification of several methods for increasing nutrient availability to muscle; identification of an idealized program of nutritional preconditioning, including objective evaluations of nutriceuticals, natural products, and traditional nutritional supplements; and methods for controlling hunger during extended periods of lipid metabolism, resulting in enhanced physical performance while utilizing stored calories. 2) THERMOPHYSIOLOGY: Fluctuations in core body temperature limit warfighter performance.  This area seeks concepts, methodologies, and technologies to control core body temperature within an ideal range that would greatly enhance physical performance.  This includes, but is not limited to, proposals investigating: a) the relationship between core body temperature and muscle and mitochondrial efficiency, including enzymology, kinetics, mechanisms, and limiting factors; and b) physical methods (non-invasive) for controlling core body temperature that result in enhanced physical strength and endurance.  A key 18-month milestone is the ability to control core body temperature within an ideal range for energy metabolism.  This ability enhances the effectiveness of physical training and physical performance.  By the end of Phase 2, it is anticipated that a deployable device for controlling core body temperature within 0.5o F will be available for transition to the military services.  In addition to controlling core body temperature, this device will enhance the effectiveness of training and (when combined with other elements of this BAA) result in a 30% increase in strength and duration of activity.  3) MUSCLE AND MITOCHONDRIA: The ideal warfighter is an endurance athlete.  This area seeks methods and mechanisms for rapidly increasing the numbers and efficiency of cardiomyocytes, slow twitch muscle fibers and mitochondria.  This includes, but is not limited to proposals investigating: a) physical methods (non-invasive), small molecule regulators, or other methods that increase mitochondrial numbers and efficiency in muscle and other tissues; b) the control of muscle phenotype and mechanisms involved in the controlled switching of muscle fiber type; c) non-traditional approaches that improve energy utilization without affecting mitochondria or muscle phenotype; d) mechanisms and methods for controlling mitochondrial uncoupling proteins in order to effect heat dissipation and, thus, greater energy production. A key 18-month milestone is the ability to increase mitochondrial numbers and efficiency and alter muscle fiber phenotype, regardless of the degree of physical activity or exercise.  By the end of Phase 2, it is anticipated that both physical methods and small molecule regulators responsible for increasing mitochondrial numbers and encouraging a slow twitch muscle fiber phenotype will be identified and that these increases (when combined with other elements of this BAA) result in a 30% increase in strength and duration of activity.  Achieving a clear understanding of the mechanisms associated with how calories are partitioned into energy or heat and how this distribution can be modified to enhance physical performance is also a Phase 2 goal.  4) RECOVERY AND MAINTENANCE: Continuous physical exertion can lead to fatigue, illness, and injury.  There is significant interest in the early identification of detrimental sequella associated with physical demand.  This includes but is not limited to proposals investigating: a) identification of the cytokine/chemokine profile related to exertion; b) the control of these inflammatory mediators to afford reduced recovery periods or longer periods of exertion; c) negative sequella associated with increased muscle and/or mitochondrial function that could cause harm; d) methods to rapidly identify and minimize problems associated with recovery and maintenance; e) the relationship between immune function and exertion in order to effectively immunize the warfighter prior to deployment and/or optimize the immune response during deployment. A key 18-month milestone is the ability to reduce post-exertion recovery time and to minimize negative consequences of enhanced performance.  At the end of Phase 2, a clear understanding of the relationship between exertion and immune response will be determined, including methods to control deleterious cytokine or chemokine effects, and the role of inflammation in exertion.  The process of controlled energy metabolism and enhanced performance will be reversible without deleterious or irreversible effects.  Adverse effects are to be identified with mechanisms for intervention.  TEAMING: Progress in the Metabolic Dominance Program will depend on the formation of well-managed interdisciplinary efforts that draw on expertise from such areas as metabolic physiology, thermophysiology, nutrition, endocrinology, muscle physiology, mitochondrial physiology, kinesiology, sports medicine, immunology, biochemistry, and vascular biology.  In addition, it is expected that a strong mathematic and/or computer modeling component will be included where necessary.  Members of interdisciplinary teams will be required to work collaboratively and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the Phase 1 objectives.  SUBMISSION OF WHITE PAPERS: We invite white papers (10 pages or less) in response to this announcement.  The white paper should be organized as follows: 1) An Executive Summary; 2) The idea.  Which area(s) of emphasis are you addressing?  3) The approach.  How will you address these areas?  Briefly define the research plan you intend to follow.  What are the research challenges, and how will they be addressed?  What is unique or revolutionary about your approach?  What additional capabilities do you envision will be enabled by your ideas?  How do you plan to demonstrate the success of the research effort within the 18-month period of funding?  Every white paper must describe specific 18-month quantitative milestone(s) that will be achieved in order to demonstrate progress in reaching the ultimate goals of the program; 4) The cost.  What is your cost estimate for resources required for the proposed time line?  This section should include a clear description of both the research and personnel resources  required.  5) The Management Plan.  A brief description of the technical expertise of the principal investigator and the key team members must be provided, along with a management plan describing how different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated to ultimately generate a proof-of-concept to be completed within 18 months.  White papers sent in response to this addendum are due to DARPA no later than 1600 hours EST, February 18, 2003.  Proposers submitting white papers will be notified within 10 business days of that date if a full proposal will be requested.  To facilitate the submission of white papers, website http://www.sainc.com/dso/ has been set up.  For more detailed instructions on submitting white papers, please refer to BAA03-02.  Not withstanding the disposition of white papers, DARPA will accept full proposals for this addendum.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Each proposal should: 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18-month scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects. Upon award, specific deliverables and appropriate level demonstrations of the science and/or technology elements will be required periodically, and a final demonstration of the deliverable system is required at the end of the program.  Given the breadth of the areas of interest, it is anticipated that only comprehensive and fully integrated team efforts addressing the entire challenge problem will be funded and, therefore, bidder teaming is highly encouraged.  Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 18 months, but consideration should be given to possible continuation of the effort into Phase 2.  If proposals include use of Government facilities, offerors will be expected to conclude commercial services arrangements with the providing Government facility.  Offeror teaming with DoD Government activities for R&D efforts other than facility use is discouraged.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.  The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes: technical and cost.  The technical and cost volumes shall conform to the guidelines in DARPA (DSO) BAA 03-02 of December 16, 2002.  To receive consideration under this addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 EDT APRIL 17, 2003, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date, will be considered under the open BAA but not this addendum.

<DESC>BAA-03-02, ADDENDUM 4, MODIFICATION 1 - PREDICTING REAL OPTIMIZED MATERIALS. The purpose of Modification 1 is to change Addendum #4 to Addendum #5 wherever it appears throughout document.egies are further encouraged.  (4) Efforts that lead to an understanding of the portion of the received signal that should be sampled, sampling rates, the number of sensors that should be deployed, and the effects of the geometrical arrangement, and their effect on the theoretical resolution that can be obtained in the image.  (5) Strategies for exploiting existing and planned data collections from existing physical and synthetic electromagnetic (acoustic) sparse arrays; as well as LADAR systems to form images of targets in clutter using time reversal methods and comparisons of the utility of these images to images formed by conventional methods for automatic target cueing, identification, and recognition.  White papers whose focus is on automatic target cueing, identification, and recognition are strongly discouraged.  (6) New sensor concepts that exploit multipath that are capable of super resolution in the acoustic, sonar, or electromagnetic domains that support automatic target cueing, identification, and recognition.  (7) Mathematical analysis and demonstrations of time reversal methods to communication systems focusing on the characterization of the multipath, the maximum available bandwidth that is supported, methods for determining the number of transmitters required to provide spatial localization at the position of the receiver.  White papers addressing electromagnetic and acoustic communications are desired.  White papers may include any combinations of the above areas.  White papers with an emphasis on the development of mathematics and algorithms that enable time reversal methods coupled to simulations or experiments are preferred to white papers that focus on the design of sensors or data collection efforts as well as automatic target cueing, recognition, and identification.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated toward solutions to these challenging problems.  It is essential that the preparation of white papers include the following areas: (1) A clear statement of the envisioned utility of the proposed research and development.  We are looking for revolutionary applications and goals that could be enabled if the proposed work is completed successfully.  While distinct goals for the execution of the proposal are required, the vision presented may extend past the performance period.  (2) A concise statement of the research challenges, approach, and potential anticipated solutions to the challenges that will be addressed.  This should include explicit timelines for which progress toward the goals can be determined and measured.  Intermediate milestones of approximately an 18 month-period with demonstrable metrics of performance must be included for the proposed work.  (3) A cost estimation for resources required for the proposed timeline.  This should include a clear description of the human resources needed as well as funding.  A management plan that describes how the different disciplines represented on the team will be integrated is critical.  (4) The white paper should consider phases of development as the challenges are met.  The first phase of the program could include theoretical analysis demonstrating the efficacy of obtaining images by exploiting time reversal methods coupled to a demonstration based upon synthetic or real data that includes characterization of the environment.  White papers must be received by 1600 EDT March 14, 2003.  Please put the phrase TIME REVERSAL METHODS in the title of the white paper.  If the authors of white papers choose not to submit electronically, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Authors of white papers will be notified by April 14, 2003, if a full proposal will be requested.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than 1600 EDT May 14, 2003.  We expect to initiate new proposals expeditiously upon peer review.  To facilitate the submission of white papers, a website http://www.sainc.com/dso/ has been set up.

<DESC>RESPONSE TO SOURCES SOUGHT QUESTIONS PART II 1.  Does a business have to possess all of the capabilities to perform all of the tasks listed in the SOW for every region? No, a business may demonstrate that it can preform a portion of the SOW, or that it can preform the entire SOW.  Additionally, since separate and multiple contracts are anticipated being award in each region, a business may ultimately propose in only one or a few regions. 2.  Will the potential small business vendors contract directly with EPA or will they be subcontractors under prime contract awards? The potential for both scenarios is available.

<DESC>The SYCO Phase 2 demonstrator will be either a brassboard, or the prototype, for ultimate use on a C-130. In the latter case, this means a "form, fit and function" solution for a C-130. Demonstration of either the breadboard, or prototype, can be performed on a surrogate platform, e.g., contractor-supplied aircraft, if in the best interest of the government. Prototypes for any other platforms than a C-130 will be addressed at a later time, based on a transition agreement negotiated and signed by DARPA and service/agency transition partner. The Government will strive to identify a platform well in advance of the CDR, with appropriate funding established to address this potential additional tasking. In summary, for purposes of the proposal, proposers should only assume a C-130 platform in addressing any TRL requirements.

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassies in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of each Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to Ghana, Uganda, and Zambia to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassies (non-travel review will be included for projects in Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea).    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassies upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassies may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) projects to be analyzed during the DM achieve a variety of developmental objectives.  The most important goals of such projects are to improve government connectivity and services to its citizens and/or to provide a backbone for public and private sector communications.  In either case, the primary measurement is the percentage of the population which gains new or improved access to communications infrastructure, thus bridging the digital divide which threatens Africa’s ability to participate and compete in the international marketplace and community.

After participating in the Microsoft African Government Leadership Forum in Johannesburg in September, USTDA has received a number of requests to consider ICT project proposals across Africa.  The most promising prospects for USTDA involvement are as follows:

Ghana, Uganda and Zambia – Each government is seeking to develop a fiber optic backbone network for public sector users, but also to provide broadband services to parastatal and private sector customers.  Each seeks a design and costing study prior to developing the project on a public-private partnership basis.  Each hopes to use the backbone to provide improved e-government services to their clients and to spur private ICT development domestically.

Democratic Republic of Congo – Ifoni (South Africa), NamPower (Namibia), Trans-Africa Projects (South Africa) and the Office Congolais des Postes et Telecommunications (Democratic Republic of Congo) are seeking assistance with final phase feasibility study analysis of a fiber-optic backbone and fixed wireless network.   The $150 million project will use SNEL (Democratic Republic of Congo’s power company) infrastructure, a new terrestrial fiber optic line, and a 430 km undersea cable to connect and provide backbone service to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Angola.  

Equatorial Guinea – A U.S. firm is working with the government to prepare a proposal for a government-wide information network to link vital ministries and their respective database and software platforms.  A non-contiguous country, Equatorial Guinea is seeking to invest its new oil revenues into public infrastructure to better serve its citizens and promote transparent government.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. 
This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SKC Pamela Nelson pamelan@roosevelt.navy.mil

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. GSA/FTS/FEDSIM in support of the United States Marine Corps, College of Continuing Education, is seeking information from commercial vendors whose products are designed to support the initial certification/re-certification of rifle marksmanship coaches via a computer based training tool and later for Marine Coaches and shooters via distance learning to include a distributed training environment.  The product must support four separate modules. (1) Marksmanship Inventory Knowledge Assessment Module.  This module is a web-based prior-knowledge assessment accessible by students over the Internet. The module assesses a student’s prior knowledge regarding marksmanship fundamentals: (2) Marksmanship Knowledge Mapper (KM) Module.   The KM module is a software application that assesses a student’s understanding of the fundamental rifle marksmanship concepts, as defined in doctrine, and the relationship of those concepts to rifle marksmanship performance. The KM module is a data-driven assessment instrument and consists of three separate applications: the Fundamentals of Marksmanship knowledge mapper, the Shot-to-Shot Explanation knowledge mapper, and the Data Book Procedures knowledge mapper: (3) Evaluation of Shooting Positions (ESP) Module.  The ESP Module is a software simulation that can be used as either an assessment instrument or as a training module.  The ESP module allows the student to manipulate a virtual shooter and assess proper shooting positions for all of the Entry-level Rifle (ELR) shooting positions and the Sustainment-level Rifle (SLR) shooting positions. The module shall have two versions: student-controlled and instructor-controlled versions: and, (4) Electronic Rifle Marksmanship Data Book Training Module.  The Data Book module is a software application that will train four basic marksmanship tasks: data book usage, sight picture, battle site zero (BZO), and shot group analysis.  The module shall have two versions. One student-controlled and the other instructor controlled.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  Interested parties shall identify existing products that meet the need of this requirement.  Vendors should provide the name of their company, POC to include phone number and email address, the product name, the OEM of the product, and any brochures or where information is located (Web address). If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include contract information (to include expiration date) in the response.  Firms who wish to respond to this RFI should send responses via email NTL 28 February 2004.

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to help the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) plan for future growth by understanding technology and market trends.  NERSC expects to continually enhance its computational resources and services.  By 2010 these resources are expected to provide at least 100 Tflop/s sustained performance, in an environment much richer in tools and functionality than is available on today's systems.  It will also assist in identifying opportunities for collaborative research, evaluation, and development that will allow NERSC to better respond to DOE needs.  Examples of areas of interest to NERSC can be found at:
http://hpcf.nersc.gov
http://www.nersc.gov/projects/gupfs
http://ftg.lbl.gov

Your response should include:

1. A roadmap of planned HPC system offerings through 2012.  The roadmap should include an overview of node architecture, network architecture, and system software.  Describe the key design points and innovative features of this system. Please include estimates of key performance metrics -- peak performance, sustained performance, I/O performance, interprocess communication performance, and any other metrics that you think are important.  Also include estimates of power consumption, and describe measures taken to reduce power consumption. 

2. Explain your current and planned research efforts related to this roadmap.  Identify the key research milestones needed for this roadmap to succeed.  Identify current and potential partners for these efforts.

3. Describe your current HPC offerings and how they fit into this roadmap.  Identify major areas of innovation and identify areas of uncertainty where input or more information about NERSC requirements would be helpful.

4. Describe your strategy for providing high performance global storage.  NERSC is pursuing centralized global storage, with high performance to and from all NERSC systems, integration with offline storage, and Grid connectivity. 

5. Describe system components related to system administration, resource and accounting management, and high reliability and availability.  Which of these exist today? What new software will you be developing?

6. Describe your software support model.  High end systems are increasingly relying on open source software to provide key functionality.  Do you expect to function as an integrator of existing software, relying to some extent on the original authors, or will your software be developed in-house?  Please explain, for the major components of software that would be provided with the system.

7. Identify any areas where collaboration that you would be interested in exploring with NERSC might help to produce a more robust system.

NERSC requests responses from companies that develop HPC systems, as well as from developers of high performance parallel storage systems and scalable cluster interconnects.  Responses from storage system and interconnect developers should describe arrangements with system vendors to integrate the component into a full HPC system. 

Responses should not exceed 10 pages.  Responses as well as questions about the RFI should be submitted electronically (as an email attachment in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format) to Lynn Rippe at rfi@nersc.gov.  Non-electronic submissions will not be considered.  Based on responses to this RFI, NERSC will invite selected respondents to discuss their plans in more detail.  NERSC intends to share information collected from this RFI with partner Office of Science laboratories, provided that any necessary non-disclosure agreements are in place.

<SOLNBR>W15P7T-04-R-G207
<RESPDATE>021704
<ARCHDATE>04172004
<CONTACT>Simone  Lucy, 732-427-1538
<DESC>The effort proposed is a follow-on SE&I effort to existing contract DAAB07-01-D-E502, sole source to Northup Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS) as the Total Systems Integrator, systems engineer and architect.  The effort includes systems architecture eng ineering, Tactical Internet architecture design and development, integration, engineering with weapon platforms and ABCS systems, software and prototype hardware design and development in support of the FBCB2 program for both terrestrial communications and  L-Band Satellite communications networks.  The system is specifically oriented to provide individual tactical vehicles and platforms with Situational Awareness and Command and Control capabilities.  The main goal of the SE&I portion of the FBCB2 Program i s the continued evolution of the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) System from delivery of the FBCB2 Version 6.4 (V6.4) Software to the FBCB2 Product Line.  The FBCB2 Product Line will provide a modular and scalable infrastructure to enhan ce system interoperability and performance attributes.  The Product Line will be incrementally delivered, building on the current phase I work (Commanders Digital Assistant) being done by NGMS for Land Warrior.  Subsequent deliveries to be covered under th is contract will add increasing FBCB2 functionality, as required, and will support a variety of variations and operational environments such as Joint Blue Force Situational Awareness (JBFSA).  It is important to note that the FBCB2 Product Line must be dev eloped as a complete design with each enhancement building on top of the previous one to ensure that the overall objectives of the Product Line Objective Architecture (OA) jointly developed by Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS) and the Software Engine ering Institute (SEI), as documented in the FBCB2 Software Architecture Design Document (SWADD), are met. Blue Force Tracking (BFT):  This follow-on contract also includes SE&I efforts for the FBCB2 BFT Software (FBCB2 over L-Band Satellite comms).  Effort s are similar to those previously described (i.e. integration and installation of the hardware and software into various Army platforms (including with some platform sub-systems) at various Army locations, as well as various testing and training requiremen ts.  Software engineering, configuration, and design work are a major portion of the BFT efforts.  BFT efforts differ from site to site and resulting Operations Centers are necessarily unique to the various locations.  BFT efforts include, among other task s, Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs) and Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) architectures; message routing; prototype hardware; field support; Army Battle Command System (ABCS) integration.  The Period of Performance for this contract will be from June 2004 through June 2009,  with a total value of approximately $40M, to include the following tasks:  Systems Engineering and Integration; Program Management; development of software and prototype  hardware to the objective capabilities as specified in the FBCB2 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and User Functional Description (UFD); perform Tactical Internet design engineering to achieve appropriate network performance; integrate application software; integrate and install the hardware and software into various Army platforms (to include with some platform sub-systems) at various Army locations; testing beyond Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E); develop logistics support plan incl uding technical manuals/technical bulletins/interactive electronic manuals (TM/TB/IETM); maintenance of logistics management information (LMI) database develop/update of support analysis plan to include maintenance planning; provisioning maintenance data; migration of FBCB2 to pc computers and small computing devices; migration of FBCB2 architecture; provide strategic vision of future FBCB2; development of software functionality and documentation necessary to accredit the FBCB2 system  through the DITSCAP process.  Subsequent software updates are forecasted at least on an annual basis.  This effort builds onto ongoing software development.  Included also is Tactical Internet Management System (TIMS).  Evolution of TIMS software applicat ion and associated products from the Block 4 functionality to be demonstrated at IOTE to its objective capability as defined in the ISYSCON ORD.  ISYSCON (V)4/Tactical Internet Management System (TIMS) application development continues to support FBCB2 net work management functions in the areas of Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) for Block 2 & Block 3 requirements.  TIMS continues to support S6 related FBCB2 functions.  TIMS development will continue to enhance the management of the Tactical Internet to includ e Situational Awareness monitoring based on future FBCB2 SA reporting implementation (i.e. SA over multicast), EPLRS monitoring, and future JTRS management requirements IAW the ISYSCON ORD.  The TIMS program will begin development of the Initialization Cap ability (IC) that will enable the soldier, without the assistance of a support contractor, to create, merge, and edit the FBCB2 and TIMS operational databases.  This capability is required to support FBCB2 block 3 and TIMS Block 5 requirements.  ISYSCON (V )/4 TIMS and Initialization Capability (IC) associate product development continues to support FBCB2 network management functions, UTR, enhanced TI management, situational awareness, EPLRS monitoring, and JTRS management.  TIMS is the Armys Brigade and Bel ow network management system.  The vendor must provide software maintenance for FBCB2 software version 3.5, which is currently in use by the U.S. Army in 4 ID, 1CAV, SBCT1, and SBCT2.  Track software problems found in the field, in the Central Technical Su pport Facility, and in other contractor facilities.  Identify significant problems, develop software patches, and manage distribution of software patches.  FBCB2 software baseline is approximately three million source lines of code composed from COTS, GOTS , and custom application software.  Currently, only limited software documentation is available. System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SSE&I) effort:  The SSEI effort is a joint/collaborative approach to a System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SSE&I) effort targeted at ABCS version 6.4 and subsequent versions.  The SE&I team will coo rdinate systems engineering across the contractors PEO C3T contracts and with other PEO C3T contractors.  The contractor shall lead and/or contribute to the following principal systems engineering tasks:  Solve critical user effectiveness issues; OPORD/OPL AN dissemination from MCS to the balance of the ABCS architecture; overlay dissemination and consistency, Blue Situational Awareness, Red Situational Awareness, Fire support (call for fire), Medevac, logistics reporting.  Engage peers from within NGMS to h elp solve these issues.  Express a clear Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the System of Systems.  Describe and develop key Operations Threads for ABCS 6.4 and subsequent versions.  Produce a unified CONOPS document for ABCS 6.4 and subsequent versions. Link CONOPS to a System Architecture and the software processes between the Battlefield Functional Area systems (BFAS).  Produce an Architecture Description Document for ABCS 6.4 and beyond.  This includes specifying and documenting the hardware and softwa re products in the ABCS 6.4 and subsequent versions.  Define and document the software interfaces in the ABCS 6.4 architecture and subsequent versions.  Define and execute the process of maintaining configuration control of these interfaces.  Define and Mo del the Data Architecture for ABCS 6.4 and subsequent versions.  Develop a top level Technology Transition Strategy that can be uniformly applied across all systems. Again, this effort is a continuation of the ongoing SE&I contract with NGMS, awarded in 2001, which was a continuation of the original Engineering, M anufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract DAAB07-95-D-E604, which was awarded competitively in 1995.  Respondents to this survey must identify their software development practices, as the Government requires state of the art, best business practices implemented.  Respondents must provide a Total System Responsibility (TSR) approach, to include any warrant y or contractor logistics support that would be considered most effective for the Army.

STATEMENT OF WORK

QYZH 01-2003 (DESC # MTH 02-5)

REPLACE EXISTING 600 GPM PUMPS, Facility 1317


1. GENERAL

This project is for the acquisition of three 600 gallon per minute (GPM) pumps to be installed inside Facility 1317.  The contractor shall remove and replace the existing 600 GPM JP-8 transfer pumps with new 600 GPM in-line centrifugal pumps, which must meet the API 610 standards (8th Edition).  These newly configured pumps will eliminate the need for two existing in-line mechanical seals with one easily replaceable seal.  They will also eliminate the need to realign the pump and motor every time the seals and/or the pump motors are replaced..  The new pumps must have a vertical drive transfer capable of delivering at least 400 GPM at 65 + PSI to the farthest outlet from the pump house.  The bidding contractors must do a site visit to calculate the pumps performance against the existing piping sizes and routes to the farthest outlet from pump house.  The calculated performance assessment must be submitted as part of the contractor’s bid. The top of the pedestal’s mounting plate filled with concrete on which the existing pumps stand must be removed.  They consist of a metal casing around Portland cement, which must be removed by jackhammer.  The pumps will be installed with all electrical and piping connections done by the contractor.   

2.  GOVERNMENT SUPPLIED MATERIAL

As-built drawings of the building 1317 piping will be made available for any of the bidding contractors to investigate.  Upon request, a copy of the as-built drawings will be made available to each potential bidder after the site visit meeting.  The site visit is scheduled for 9 February at 10:00a.m.  All parties interested in a site visit need to send confirmation e-mail to TSgt Berrett (travis.berrett@mountainhome.af.mil).  All interested parties need to meet Lt Hadley, Project Officer, at the Mountain Home AFB main gate NLT 9:30 a.m. on the morning of the 9th.  All individuals need to have a picture ID to gain entrance to the installation.  Other drawings or supplemental information will be provided as requested.  All drawings provided by the Air Force must be field verified by the contractor. 

3.  SPECIFICS:

Air Force personnel will remove the existing pumps from existing pump pedestals and remove any other associated items of the pumps as necessary for the new installation of pumps by contractor.  
   
Each bidder shall provide a complete cost estimate or price to provide and install the new pumps in Facility 1317.  Each bidder shall include their calculated performance assessment as part of their bid.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

A critical area of focus for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the development of radiological and nuclear countermeasure systems that improve our capability to address the threat of a radiological dispersal device (RDD), an improvised nuclear device (IND), or a nuclear weapon being used by terrorists within the US.  DHS is implementing a comprehensive systems approach that emphasizes early detection and effective intervention capabilities at the Federal, state, and local levels, as well as post-event capabilities for remediation.  Under the Detector Systems for Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures (DSRNC) program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), HSARPA solicits detector systems that will contribute to an overall system of countermeasures.
