<DESC>NA The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) program for environmental technologies. The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving proposals for environmental te chnologies that address DoD requirements. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCPs intent to competitively fund demonstration and validation projects for innovative and new environmental technologies that address the selective topic areas described in the ESTCP Program Announcement. The Program Announce ment can be found on the ESTCP Home Page accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.estcp.org/. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards will take the form of contracts. Before pr eparing a proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the ESTCP Program Announcement for details regarding the programs objectives, proposal submission requirements, the evaluation of proposals, and the individual topic areas. ES TCP is seeking proposals for environmental technologies in the following topics only:  1) Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Detection, Discrimination, and Remediation;  2) In Situ Remediation of Contaminated Sediments, 3) Characterization and Treatment of Range Contamination, or 4) In Situ Remediation of Groundwater. ESTCP is seeking these proposals as candidates for funding beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2004. Awardees un der this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal white paper, including a signed original, plus five additional copies, referenc ing this BAA, to Brenda Batch, ESTCP Program Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821. White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM EST on Thursday, March 13, 2003. It is strongly recommended that pre-proposal white paper s be sent via overnight carrier or certified mail to document and ensure receipt. Pre-proposal white papers sent via fax or electronic mail will be rejected. Pre-proposal white papers should be no longer than five pages, not including the cover page, singl e-sided, and a font no smaller than 11 point. All margins (top, bottom, left and right) should not be less than 1 inch. One attachment of up to three single-sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page should be in the format specified in  the Program Announcement found on the ESTCP Home Page (www.estcp.org). The pre-proposal white paper must concisely describe what technology the proposer has to offer ESTCP, including its level of development or maturity, and its cost/benefit. The pre-prop osal white paper should use the following format (also described in the Program Announcement at www.estcp.org): 1. Short Descriptive Title: 2. ESTCP Topic Area: (i.e. UXO Detection, In Situ Remediation of Contaminated Sediments, Characterization and Treatm ent of Range Contamination, or In Situ Remediation of Groundwater ) 3. Problem statement: The specific problem the proposed technology addresses. 4. Technology Description: Describe the technology that is being proposed and the technical objective of the s pecific demonstration. The project description should include the following information: (a) technical description and justification of proposed technology demonstration, including a description of how the technology is innovative; (b) evidence the technol ogy is mature enough for demonstration (include references); and (c) potential issues of concern and technical risks in taking the technology from the lab to field testing. Any limitations of the technology for different sites should be explicitly descr ibed. 5. DoD Benefit: Quantitatively describe expected benefits in terms of reduced cost and risk. Assess cost/benefit per site (in terms of cost per area or volume treated) or application. Provide realistic cost/benefit estimates over existing technologie s and approaches. Provide a basis for the expected benefit. 6. Schedule: Provide an expected schedule for the project. Explicitly describe any development, design, or treatability work required prior to actual field demonstration. 7. Cost Estimate: Provide  an estimate for the level of funding required, including any development, design, or treatability work. Whereas identification of a specific demonstration site is not required for pre-proposals, include an estimate for the cost for a representative field demonstration of the technology. 8. Performers: List all institutional performers involved in the proposed demonstration and their expected contributions. List the name and organization of the lead person(s) for each organization involved. Provide as an at tachment a one page curriculum vitae for each of the principal performers (not included in the five page pre-proposal count). Based upon the pre-proposal white paper evaluation by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information and may  be encouraged to submit a full proposal by a set time and date. The format requirements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on the ESTCP Home Page (http://www.estcp.org/). Each of the pre-proposal white paper submitters will be  notified as to whether the Government requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. The white paper review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologies without incurring the expense of a f ull proposal. For those entities which are selected to provide proposals but do not have a DoD partner or a DoD demonstration site, a partner will be selected in order that a federal demonstration site may be identified. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor be responsible for any money expended by the offer before contract award is made for a demonstration projec t. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area. It is expected that awards will result totaling approximately $1.0 million for the first year of work. Pre-proposal white papers and full proposals will be evaluated against the following f actors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) ESTCP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission responds to a DoD environmental requirement as described in the topic area; (2) readiness for demonstration/validation (Pass/Fail) - whether the prop osed technology is at the appropriate stage of develop to warrant and benefit from a demonstration/validation; (3) the overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed technology; (4) cost/benefit of the technology; (5) potential for transition of t he proposed technology; and (6) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds. Information concerning non-technical issues can be obtained from Mr. James F. Bowers, HECSA, 703-428-7406. Information concerning technical issues can be obtained from  Ms. Brenda Batch, ESTCP Program Office, 703-696-2127

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals.  It is anticipated that the BAA-NHLBI-HR-03-04 will be available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/index.htm on or about January 24, 2003.  The objective of the BAA is to establish a Tuberculosis Curriculum Coordinating Center (TCCC) to strengthen, expand, increase access to, and implement the best ongoing educational and training opportunities in tuberculosis for use by faculty, students, and affiliated house staff at medical, nursing, and allied health schools, especially those that provide primary care to communities where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic and the population is at high risk of developing TB.  The TB Consortium, consisting of a maximum of thirty-one (31) participating sites, will have a pyramidical structure with the Tuberculosis Curriculum Coordinating Center  (TCCC) at the first level, five institutions of higher learning called Curriculum Centers (CCs) at the second level, and at the third level, as existing or proposed partners working with each CC, up to five medical/nursing/allied health schools.  It is also possible to partner with non-profit institutions that have a mission in health education or health service to underserved populations. The TCCC will identify and/or establish formal working relationships with five institutions of higher learning (CCs), which must in turn demonstrate existing or proposed working relationships with up to five additional institutions, some of which may serve populations that are at high risk of developing TB.  The TCCC may serve as one of the CCs. The TCCC will work with the CCs  in a collaborative effort to: 1) review existing TB educational materials, eliminate outdated materials,  and  adapt these materials to the needs of the various health education institutions that serve high-risk communities and to the cultural and specific needs of targeted communities, 2) define competencies for various educational levels, 3) develop new materials and tools as needed,  4) obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forms clearance, 5) implement the curriculum not only in schools in at-risk areas, but also in areas where the risk of TB is low, 6) disseminate the TB curriculum materials on the TB website and through other formats, and 7) develop and test survey instruments for monitoring the quality and effectiveness of the TB curriculum program. The TCCC will develop and administer a TB website on an open-source server, coordinate the activities of the Consortium, and assume ultimate responsibility for the materials developed by the Consortium. The TCCC will define TB competencies, and identify and address tuberculosis curriculum deficiencies and needs in medical, nursing, and allied health schools. The TCCC will be responsible for preparing agendas, coordinating and managing annual meetings and monthly conference calls, as well as unexpected meetings of the Consortium.  The TCCC will also be responsible for the placement of the core curricula and related materials on the TB website.  The web-based curricula will be the result of a highly collaborative and integrated effort among Consortium participants, utilize state-of-the-art technology for distant learning, and be a primary source for all educational and training materials generated under this program. This program should complement and integrate existing web-based curricula.  The TCCC will also obtain CME, CEU, and other forms of accreditation to provide an avenue for practicing health professionals to maintain their proficiency in tuberculosis.  One award will be made under this solicitation and will be to an offeror located within the U.S. and its territories and possessions.  Letters of intent are due no later than February 7, 2003.

<CONTACT>Valerie Browning, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 703-696-2314, Fax 703-696-3999, Email none
<DESC>DIRECT THERMAL TO ELECTRIC CONVERSION (DTEC), SOL: BAA03-04, DUE 4 APRIL 2003, POC: Dr. Valerie M. Browning, DARPA/DSO, FAX: (571) 218-4553, WEB: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/, E-MAIL: baa03-04@darpa.mil.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals for the development and demonstration of novel, high-efficiency Direct Thermal to Electric Conversion (DTEC) technologies.  Recent advances in thermal to electric conversion technologies such as thermoelectrics and thermophotovoltaics have demonstrated the potential for achieving high-efficiency, solid-state electric generators that could convert thermal energy to electricity for future electric and hybrid electric military platforms.  The efficiency by which heat can be converted to electricity is, of course, limited by the theoretical maximum efficiency of the Carnot cycle.  Although the Carnot efficiencies drop as the temperature differences between hot and cold side decreases, the theoretical maximum conversion efficiencies can range from a low of ~ 40 percent to a high of ~ 77 percent using thermal sources consistent with those found on various military platforms where available hot side temperatures can range from ~ 300 deg C to 1000 deg C.  Unfortunately, state-of-the-art DTEC technologies fall far short of Carnot conversion efficiencies and, in many cases, do not exhibit sufficient power densities to meet mission requirements for many commercial and Defense applications.  Therefore, it is the intent of this BAA to solicit proposals that address revolutionary advancements to the state-of-the-art in DTEC technologies that would significantly reduce the gap between achievable conversion efficiencies and Carnot efficiencies.  There are currently a number of existing technologies that have already been demonstrated for converting thermal energy to electricity.  Some of the most common are thermoelectrics (TE), thermionics (TI), alkali metal thermal to electric (AMTEC) and thermophotovoltaics (TPV).  Recent advances in these technologies have resulted in demonstrated conversion efficiencies ranging from a few percent to ~ 20%.  Unfortunately, the higher efficiencies are typically only achievable at temperatures significantly greater than 1000 deg C and/or are often associated with low power densities (< 1 W/cm^2).  The goal of this DARPA BAA is to explore the possibility of achieving > 20% thermal to electric conversion efficiencies at power densities that exceed 2 W/cm^2 at hot side operating temperatures < 1000 deg C.  Proposals that address revolutionary advances to existing DTEC technologies are acceptable as are proposals that address novel DTEC technologies for which no proof of principle has been demonstrated.  Examples of the latter include, but are not limited to, close spaced thermionics, thermo-tunneling, and thermo-magnetics.  Irrespective of the DTEC technology, prospective offerors are requested to submit a technology development and demonstration plan that targets a 3 year program deliverable of a > 1 kW converter.  Target efficiencies for the converter are > 20 %, with power density > 2 W/cm^2 and hot side temperature < 1000 deg C, with greater merit perceived for lower temperatures as thermal management and material robustness issues are less severe at lower temperatures.  Targets for gravimetric or volumetric power densities are to be specified by proposers, since these can vary widely depending on the platform and manner in which they are deployed.  However it is anticipated that values for gravimetric and/or volumetric power densities will meet or exceed that which is achievable via existing similarly deployed power generation technologies such as gas or steam powered turbine engines.  The first 18 months of any effort funded under this BAA, Phase I, are expected to provide a ?proof of concept? for a novel, high-efficiency thermal to electric conversion technology consistent with the performance goals specified in this BAA and the accompanying Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  Proposers are expected to provide quantitative milestone objectives and performance metrics for this initial Phase I effort.  The results of Phase I will serve as go/no-go decision points for determining the value of continuing the effort for the remaining 18 months, Phase II.  Milestones are also to be proposed for the Phase II effort, but may be revised depending on the results of the initial ?proof of concept? phase.  Further details on milestone requirements and go/no-go decision points can be found in the PIP.  GENERAL INFORMATION.  Proposers must obtain the pamphlet entitled ?BAA 03-04 DTEC Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP),? which provides detailed information on program objectives, areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other program information.  This pamphlet may be requested from the World Wide Web (WWW), fax, electronic mail (e-mail), or mail requests through the administrative contact information given below.  This announcement and the PIP may be retrieved via the WWW at URL: http://www.darpa.mil/baa.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation should be directed to DARPA/DSO, BAA03-04 fax:  (571) 218-4553, electronic mail (e-mail):  BAA03-04@darpa.mil or mail:  DARPA/DSO, ATTN:  BAA03-04, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (e-mail or fax is preferred).

Copies of proposal submissions may contain duplicates of the original cover sheet.  Please include e-mail addresses on cover page.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted and institutional brochures, reprints, and videotapes will be ignored.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence.  Early submission of proposals is encouraged.  Selections can be made at any time during the process.  Within approximately ten (10) business days of receipt, DARPA will acknowledge receipt of the submission and assign a control number that should be used in all further correspondence regarding the proposal.  Volume I Technical Proposal.  The technical proposal is limited to fifty (50) pages, including the cover sheet, all figures, references, tables, charts, and appendices.  The full proposal will be evaluated according to the criteria described in this BAA and in Section 1.3 of the PIP.  The proposed effort should be in two phases that are scheduled in accordance with the guidance provided in the PIP.  Proposers should make sure that it contains the following: 1) Cover sheet with required information (see above); 2) Executive Summary (two pages or less); 3) technical approach including discussions of all technical issues discussed in Section 1.2 of the PIP; 4) time-phased milestone chart; 5) a table showing a page cross reference between the Selection Criteria listed below (and in the PIP) and the technical discussion; 6) organizational structure of the team (and all subcontractors) and management approach; 7) summary of relevant prior work; 8) brief description of applicable facilities and equipment; and 9) short resumes of key individuals.  See the accompanying PIP for additional information on the required format and contents of the Technical Proposal.  Volume II Cost Proposal.  The cost volume shall contain the following:  1) Cover sheet with required information (see above); 2) Detailed cost breakdown to include:  (a) total program cost broken down by major cost items (direct labor, subcontracts, materials, travel, other direct costs, overhead charges, etc.) and (b) an itemization of major subcontracts (labor, travel, materials and other direct costs) and equipment purchases.  Where the effort consists of multiple portions that could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options with separate cost estimates for each; and 3) Supporting cost and pricing information in sufficient detail to substantiate the summary cost estimates in 2) above.  Include a description of the method used to estimate costs and supporting documentation.  Note:  ?cost or pricing data? as defined in FAR Subpart 2.101 shall be required if the offeror?s proposal is for a procurement contract award of $550,000 or greater unless the offeror requests an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data.  ?Cost or pricing data? are not required if the offeror proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  The requirements for submission of ?cost or pricing data? are specified in FAR Subpart 15.403-4 (see http://www.arnet.gov/far).  OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION.  Teaming and Team Compositions.  Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.  While there are no restrictions on the minimum or maximum size of these teams, proposers must justify the need to include team members based on their expertise, facilities, and overall contribution to the proposed effort.  To assist the teaming process an interactive web site has been established at URL: http://www.sainc.com/darpa/dtec.  Individual researchers and organizations with specific, relevant expertise and/or capabilities may provide non-proprietary descriptions of their capabilities and interests.  The web site will remain active from the date of issuance of this BAA until proposals are due.  Proposals may include foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified.  The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and to join others in submitting proposals.  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Consequently, all offerors and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA), or similar support, to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  Proprietary Information.  All proprietary information should be marked on the full proposal.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with DARPA, unless the specific phrase ?TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY? appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes.  Security.  Proposals may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI).  Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals above DoD SECRET should contact DARPA security at the address identified in this BAA (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation.  Offerors must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance.  Proposals that are considered less than satisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further.  Further details on evaluation criteria may be found in the DTEC PIP.  Scientific and Technical Merit.  Proposers must demonstrate that they understand the goals of the DTEC program as well as state-of-the-art for existing DTEC technologies.  They must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique and that their proposed technical approach is sound.  They must provide a balanced program plan that identifies and mitigates the technical risks involved in their proposed approach.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.  Value to Defense.  Proposers must demonstrate the potential of their proposed DTEC technology to radically change military power generation capabilities or improve national security with a clear statement of the goals of their program and a quantitative comparison with existing technology.  Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort.  Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.  Proposers must demonstrate a balanced management plan that demonstrates that team members will be working together towards a common goal.  Cost Realism.  Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.  ADMINISTRATION.  Address for Submission of Full Proposals (except classified proposals).  DARPA/DSO, ATTN: BAA03-04, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  Guidance for Classified Information and Data.  Proposers should contact Nancy Kassner, Director, Security & Intelligence Directorate (703-696-2385) for information on security or for instructions for the submission of a classified proposal.

PROJECT INFORMATION:  Different engineering assignments at various locations within the Corps of Engineeers New England District which could include various desi gn and/or construction services requiring licensed design professionals in the civil, mechanical, electrical, structural, and architectural disciplines.  Expertise in hydrology, hydraulics to include knowledge and experience with applicable computer progra ms such as HEC RAS, HEC HMS, Dambreak etc, and environmental engineering is also desirable.  The types of work that will be required includes, but is not limited to, work described by the following profile codes as defined in the Standard Form 254: 008, 01 0, 011, 019, 020, 021, 023, 024, 025, 029, 033, 035, 036, 037, 039, 042, 043, 046, 051, 055, 056, 061, 062, 066, 078, 079, 080, 088, 089, 092, 095, 096, 101, 104, 111, 112, 114, & 115.  3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The Corps of Engineers New England District will use both primary and secondary selection criteria.  The secondary selection criteria will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.         (1) Primary Selection Criteria:  The Primary Selection Criteria (a-f  below) are listed in descending order of importance. a. The firm must have on its staff or provide through a consultant, professional engineers with demonstrated expertise in all  those disciplines listed above.  The firm must also have staff or provide through a consultant, personnel with professional registration in all six New England states: ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, RI.  Firms not demonstrating these requirements will be disqualifie d from further consideration.  b. The firm must have the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  c. The firm must possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with perfo rmance schedules.  d.  Firms must demonstrate previous experience in preparing construction cost estimates with Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis methodology.  The firm shall also demonstrate experience in th e development of construction contingencies based upon the knowledge of Risk Analysis and level of design detail. e. Firms should have capability to provide all deliverables in MicroStation V7 DGN format.  The Government will only accept this format, witho ut conversion or reformatting, in the target CADD software format and on the target platform specified herein.  The target platform is a PC/Workstation with an Intel compatible central processing unit and a Windows 2000 operating system.  Advanced software  application files used for civil design and drawings shall be delivered in formats compatible with INROADS(Bentley Civil Engineering).  All delivered CADD files shall be in compliance with A/E/C CADD Standard Release 2.0.  f. Firms must demonstrate knowle dge of preparing specifications for construction contracts using a personal computer based software package.  All specifications for Corps of Engineers (COE) contracts will be prepared using Guide Specifications and SPECSINTACT.    	(2) Secondary Selection Criteria: 	a. SB and SDB Part icipation. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a pri me contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration 	b. Geographic Proximity. Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project. Hence, proximity should normally only be used as a selection criterion for small or routine projects or ID contracts in support of a specific installation(s).  It will have very little bearing on this sel ection. 	c. Volume of DoD Contract Awards.  DoD A-E contract awards can be obtained from ACASS, and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms.  4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit four copies of SF 255 (11/92 edition), and four copies of SF 254 (11/92 edition) to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, ATTN:  A-E Uni t, 696 Virginia Road, Concord MA  01742-2751.  Submissions are due not later than the close of business on the February 7, 2003.  Four copies of SF 254 are also required for each proposed consultant.  It should be noted that SF255s are not required for pro posed consultants.  Include ACASS number in Section 2b. of the SF255.  Call the ACASS Center at 503-808-4591 to obtain a number.  In Section 10 of the SF 255 describe the firm's overall design quality management plan, including management approach, coordin ation of disciplines and subcontractors, and quality control procedures that must include an independent technical review.  Solicitation packages are not provided.  This is not a request for proposal.

<SUBJECT>A--Development of Novel Sensors for Ultra High Temperature Fossil Fuel Applications
<SOLNBR>DE-PS26-03NT41731
<CONTACT>Mary Gabriele, Contracting Officer, Contact Contract Specialist, mgabri@netl.doe.gov;Kelly McDonald, Contract Specialist, 304-285-4113, kelly.mcdonald@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>Notice is hereby given of the intent to issue Financial Assistance Solicitation No. DE-PS26-03NT41731 entitled "Development of Novel Sensors for Ultra High Temperature Fossil Fuel Applications."  The National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL's) Advanced Research Program is leading the effort in innovative sensor development for fossil fuel applications including the power systems conceived under the Vision 21 Program, such as oxygen blown gasification and combustion systems.  Real time monitoring, diagnostics and control are critical for the safe and efficient operation of the energy conversion systems.  However, due to the harsh conditions, current instrumentation and sensor technology is inadequate for the systems.  The lack of suitable on-line measurement technology represents the primary motivation for seeking out new developments in sensor technology. The specific objective of this solicitation is to seek out new fundamental approaches to sensor concepts, materials, design, and fabrication that have potential application in the harsh environment of the advanced fossil fuel-based energy production systems.  The types of projects sought through this solicitation include laboratory and bench-scale testing as well as fundamental research that addresses the barriers associated with ultra-high temperature operation. The research objectives are to:  (1)Develop an understanding of the sensor mechanisms acquired by nano-scale design; (2)Develop technology for fusion of high temperature materials and advanced sensors; (3)Develop long term high temperature data for life prediction and reliability; (4)Devise life assessment models and experimental verification; (5)Obtain a quantitative description of the evolutionary processes that lead to failure and predict response of sensor materials in complex environments; (6) Miniaturize sensors; and (7) Explore self-contained sensor intelligence based on smart materials.  (Smart materials may be defined as the materials that respond to environmental changes at optimal conditions and manifest their functions according to the changes. The generic term "smart materials" includes the materials and probes that can provide information on a coating or process material while in service.  The information can be used via a suitable process control  mechanism to assess remaining life as well as to regulate the operating conditions.  Examples of smart materials are shape memory alloys, optical fiber hybrid composites, and piezoelectric hybrid composites.) While the solicitation seeks out fundamental developments, the ultimate goal of the sensor program is to develop devices that can used for the measurement of temperature, pressure, and detection of various gases (O2, H2, N2, H2S, CH4, etc.) under conditions of high temperature (1000 oC) and elevated pressures (up to 500 psi).  Low cost, in situ or embedded sensors that survive approximately one year of service in the presence corrosive and erosive conditions are ideal.  The incorporation of self diagnostics / smart sensor functions is desired to verify performance and accuracy. It is anticipated that this program solicitation will result in three (3) to six (6) awards.  The period of performance for each award will range from one to three years with budget periods to be established independently based on the logical technical phases of each individual project.  Cost sharing is encouraged, but not required under the subject program solicitation. Once released, the solicitation will only be made available in IIPS, no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.  Telephone requests, written requests, E-mail requests, or facsimile requests for a copy of the solicitation package will not be accepted and/or honored.  Applications must be prepared and submitted in accordance with the instructions and forms contained in the solicitation.  The actual solicitation document will allow for requests for explanation and/or interpretation. However, all questions relating to the solicitation must be submitted electronically through IIPS.  All responses to questions, as well as all amendments to the solicitation, will be released on the IIPS homepage.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) has a requirement to determine usability problems with the USFA web site (www.usfa.fema.gov) so that priorities for a future redesign to correct deficiencies and weaknesses may be set.  The result of the study will be incorporated into any future redesign efforts undertaken by FEMA's designated Internet services provider, Verizon Federal.  Areas to be assessed include user experience, interaction design, and accessibility under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  The USFA website has been in existence since 1995.  It currently receives an average of 9 million hits and 275,000 visitors per month.  A wide variety of information is contained on the site, e.g. National Fire Academy training schedules and course materials, publications, fire safety tips and fact sheets, press releases, statistics, product and equipment recalls, project descriptions, etc.  (The site also contains a Kids Page that will not be considered under this Statement of Work.)  There are 3,400 HTML pages (using a Cold Fusion template and CSS) and six Cold Fusion database applications, including an online publications shopping application, with several others in development.  A content management system is not used.  The site uses an Inktomi search engine and Lyris ListManager for e-mail list subscriptions.  85% of site visitors use Internet Explorer and 7% use version 4.0 or older browsers.  This requirement is 100% Small Business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541519, Other Computer Related Services, and Small Business Size Standard is $21 Million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years].  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded using simplified acquisiton procedures (under $100,000).  The award will be based on "Best Value" to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package.  Quotes will be due 02-24-2003.  Potential offerors must request the RFQ package in writing to:  Patrick Hobbs, NETC Acquisition Section, 16825 South Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, MD 21727 or e-mail to: pat.hobbs@fema.gov

Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  3.

Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.   
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT.  (POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.)  

ANNUAL RESOLICITATION OF RECORD LINKAGE MASTER AGREEMENT (N01-CP-01003-13)	

The Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, National Cancer Institute (NCI) is interested in expanding their existing pool of Master Agreement holders for "Record Linkage Studies Utilizing Resources in Population-Based Tumor Registries".  The NCI desires to contract with population-based tumor registries in order to collaborate in the conduct of record-linkage and subsequent analytical investigations.  The main tasks in support of the record-linkage studies include: developing a study plan; developing or applying appropriate record-linkage procedures to link a population file with the cancer registry files; evaluating results from the record-linkage study; providing results of the record-linkage study to the NCI in the form of a computer file with appropriate documentation of record format and variables used; developing record-keeping procedures to maintain filing systems of all relevant material; and monitoring performance and providing written technical and financial reports as required under a subsequent Master Agreement Order.  Optional capabilities include providing biologic specimens and providing access to other existing computerized registries that have been or could be linked to the cancer registry.  Offerors will be evaluated on their qualification as a population-based cancer registry including their knowledge of the population at risk; ability to provide completeness of ascertainment of incident cancer cases in the population; validity of classification and coding of all cancer cases; procedures used for case follow-up; ability to provide five-year cancer incidence data; ability to maintain data in a secure environment; and qualifications and experience of the registry and personnel.  In addition, offerors will be evaluated on their technical response to a sample master agreement order on a hypothetical record-linkage study.  

The Master Agreement contract mechanism is a pre-qualification to enable qualified sources to compete for and perform future contracts, which will be awarded based on Request for Proposals (RFPs).  Master Agreements (MA) will be awarded to all offerors whose technical proposal is determined to be acceptable.  The initial Master Agreement award is non-monetary and is exclusively for the purpose of establishing a pool of contractors who are qualified to perform services for epidemiologic studies of cancer using the resources of population-based tumor registries.  The obligation of funds shall be accomplished solely through the award of a contract.  Each MA holder will be eligible to compete for future contract awards for record-linkage studies.  Each MA holder who is also determined to be qualified to provide the optional biospecimen component and/or the ability to link other population-based registries to their cancer registry will be eligible to compete for those types of orders as well.  Current MA holders who are currently not eligible to compete for the biospecimen component or ability to link to other population-based registries component, may submit additional clarifying information which will be reviewed to determine technical acceptability for those options.  MA holders who choose to compete for future Master Agreement Orders will be selected based on technical merit, budgetary considerations and other factors.  All responsible sources meeting these criteria are encouraged to submit a proposal and will be considered by the NCI.  All proposals should reference N01-CP-01003-13.

It is anticipated that the solicitation package will be available electronically on or about January 15, 2002.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/, then Click on "Current Requests for Proposals" to locate this solicitation. Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after release of the solicitation package.  Any MA awarded as a result of this solicitation will be in effect from the effective date to July 30, 2005. (This solicitation will be open for the duration of the existing MA pool (through July 30, 2005) with due dates for receipt of proposals annually, March 20 (or the next business day) of each year.  ALL MASTER AGREEMENT HOLDERS ALREADY IN THE EXISTING MASTER AGREEMENT POOL NEED NOT RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), plans to procure services for the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Health Study from the University of Minnesota, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Del Code 8807 Mayo, 420 Delaware Street S E, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.  This acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The mission of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics includes the planning and conduct of research using epidemiologic and biostatistical approaches to investigate the distribution and determinants of cancer in human populations.  The Radiation Epidemiology Branch is specifically charged with identifying and quantifying the risk of cancer in populations exposed to ionizing radiation.  In 1982, the Radiation Epidemiology Branch contracted with the University of Minnesota (N01-CP-21015) to conduct an epidemiologic study of 145,000 medical x-ray technologists certified by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) between 1926 and 1982.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term health effects of chronic occupational exposure to moderate- to low-level radiation.  A baseline survey was conducted during 1984-87.  Detailed data on work history, cancer prevalence, and cancer risk factors were provided by more than 90,000 (68%) technologists.   Sole-source add-on contracts were awarded to the University of Minnesota in 1991 (NO1-CP-15673) and 1995 (N01-CP-51016) to establish a repository of biologic samples for genetic studies and to conduct a second survey for incident cancers.  Approximately 91,000 technologists completed the second survey during 1995-98 (72% overall; 84% of first survey responders), providing updated and more detailed information on employment histories, medical exposures, gynecologic and reproductive histories, and many other cancer risk factors.  More than 7,000 additional cancers were reported.  Ongoing efforts in cancer validation, quality control review of a combined cancer confirmation file, and blood collection was completed in 2000.  The potential for this cohort to contribute needed information to our limited understanding of protracted low dose radiation is extensive.  Generally healthy people of all ages, races, and both genders, whose radiation doses can be well characterized, are available for study.  These x-ray technologists have received a wide range of doses and many have performed jobs which resulted in considerable cumulative radiation doses.  We recently completed a dose assessment (Version 1), reconstructing annual doses for the 90,000 technologists who completed the baseline survey.  With the availability of genetic information, it will now be possible to conduct analyses of gene-radiation interactions.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of the current experiment.   Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through 12 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies.  Minimum Requirements:  The requirements to be accomplished by the contractor for this procurement are to: (a) coordinate collection of blood samples and updated risk factor information from subgroups of the radiologic technologists; (b) medically validate cancers; (c) perform expert nosology coding of all outcomes; (d) data coding, keying, and quality control review; and (f) maintain a receipt control system to monitor all activities.   The University of Minnesota is the only source known to the NCI that has direct involvement in collecting the data through two large questionnaire surveys, conducting medical validation, and obtaining biospecimens and risk factor information from study subjects, staff from the University of Minnesota have intimate knowledge of the information contained within this comprehensive database and are uniquely qualified to interpret these data. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington D.C. time) on January 24, 2003.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) provides an opportunity for members of the science community to participate in the NASA Science Team for the National Polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP)  http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/  .  Key measurements that were initiated with the Earth Observing System's Terra and Aqua missions will be continued by the NPP. With an NPP launch in 2006, near the expected end of the Terra lifetime, NPP provides a "bridge" between the EOS Terra and Aqua missions and the NPOESS, currently with its initial launch in 2009. The NPP Science Team will include a number of experts familiar with the development of algorithms to retrieve global change properties from sensors like VIIRS, CrIS, ATMS, and OMPS. Expertise in both sensors and algorithms is needed.  The team also will incorporate data system experts and persons concerned with assimilation of this data into Earth system prediction models. The team size will likely be between 10 and 20 team members, depending on the range of activities proposed. This NRA is open to all scientific investigators who submit proposals that respond to the objectives of the program, and which meet the other requirements stated in this announcement. Awards will be for the period of 36 months, with a potential extension for up to an additional 12 months, depending on the timing of the subsequent NRA to be issued for research, analysis and modeling activities.  Approximately $2-3M per year is available, with individual awards depending on the range of activities proposed and the total number of team members selected. Participation in the program is open to all categories of institutions, including educational, industrial, non-profit organizations, NASA centers and other US agencies. Because their duties will necessarily involve access to some data and software that remain company proprietary and competition sensitive, team members and their staff will have to sign non-disclosure agreements with the NPOESS system contractor and their sensor vendors. For this same reason, industrial proposers will have to demonstrate how their activities will be isolated from their parent institution. Due to ITAR restrictions, foreign proposals cannot be accepted. The complete NRA will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities Web Page at  http://research.nasa.gov  under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)". A paper copy will be available to those who do not have access to Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message. This announcement will be open from January 28, 2003 through March 31, 2003, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout this period.

<CONTACT>Roy Higgins Roy.Higgins@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Force Protection Command and Control Systems Program Office (ESC/FD) wishes to identify for possible demonstration purposes, products or concepts that delay and/or deny unauthorized access to critical national security assets and weapons systems.  On 18-19 March 03, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) and Sandia National Laboratories are hosting a Nuclear Weapons Security Enhancement Summit at Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM.  The day after this conference, we are offering the opportunity for organizations, Government or private industry, to display and discuss their potential solutions to the attendees of this summit.  These solutions should include anything from non-lethal delay to lethal denial.  Displaying organizations should discuss the capability of their solution(s) from a performance perspective.  Of particular interest are technologies that lean forward to provide defending forces new and integrated solutions to defeat hostile intruders that are determined to gain access to high value assets.  Starting later this fiscal year, we anticipate initiating a multi-million dollar program to develop, test, integrate, and install and/or upgrade delay/denial technologies at high value assets locations.  This demonstration will provide the Government some knowledge of what is available, but this demonstration is not part of the source selection process for the anticipated program.  The Government will review all replies to this RFI.  The products or concepts that best meet our intent to show the state-of-the-art or the state-of-the-possible will be asked to display on 20 March 03 at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM.

If, however, this consideration exceeds $500, a second contract modification shall be issued reducing the Contractor's obligation to $500 (the administrative cost of issuing the two required modifications).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR Terra Video Production.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify statement of work and to extend the due date. 1.   What is the purpose of the Terra Video?  Who is the target audience? At the cognitive level, the target audience is "educated lay people".  This may be senior managers at NASA Headquarters, persons on Capitol Hill, and perhaps even museum exhibit developers.  The audience should take away the message that NASA's Terra Mission is proving to be a great success and has already returned information and data for the taxpayer's investiment.  Moreover, the audience should learn something about Terr's measurement capabilities and the new things Terra has taught us about our world as well as how this new knowledge is relevant and potentially useful to the viewing audience. 2.  Has the scope and script for the Terra video been set? No, not yet.  The scope and script will be done in collaboration with the winning contractor, the Terra Project Scientist, and five Terra instrument team leaders, and the Terra Mission science writer.  Subsequently, selection of visual materials will be made in consultation with the contractor.   3.  What assets will NASA provide for doing this job? NASA is providing all of the Terra data visulaizations and any cartoon animations needed to illustrate key scientific concepts.  NASA will provide all footage in a digital format at HD resolution.  Original file formats will be varied, including TIFF, TARGA, and QuickTime. 4.  Are there examples of the assets NASA will provide that contractors can review? Yes, to review examples of the types of visual assets NASA has,  check out the Terra home page at http://terra.nasa.gov as well as browse through the Earth Observatory's page at  http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov  Features, Natural Hazards, Images and Data, and Images of the Day section.  For the news and feature stories, in particular, be sure to review the images and data visualizations.  What data visualizations NASA provides will be similar to these, but probably fine-tuned for this purpose. 5.  What assets will the contractor provide? The contractor will provide video editing and production expertise as well as any equipment needed to produce and edit the video.  NASA recognizes that, in order to enhance the viewing experience of the video, there may be some need for additional graphics, titles or subtitles, graphics between fades, credits, etc., all of which will be provided by the contractor.  NASA will provide the main visual elements, but there may still be some need for other graphical elements and so contractors should speak to their ability to produce such graphics in their proposals.  Similarly, there may be a need to include video footage or stock photography. Any stock photos needed or art elements needed to complement the Terra video will be provided by the contractor. 6.  What about voice narration? NASA does not have any voice talent assigned to this project and would like to choose the voice talent in consultation with the contractor.  Please note that a celebrity narrator is not required; just a good voice.  If a recognizable celebrity can be used and is shown to not be a significant cost drive, then that will be a consideration.  Note:  there can be no copyright constraints on distribution of the finished audio-visual assets.  7.  Why does NASA alse require digital, high definition copies of all resources if the final product is in standard definition video? NASA requires digital copies of all files because NASA intends to pursue other dissemination avenues in addition to VHS tapes.  For instance, some or all of the video may be published on the Web, on CD or DVD, on interactive kiosks in museums or science centers, etc.  So, the goal is to extend the utility of the finished product beyond just an analog format.  Similarly, the intent is to try to leave room for extending the shelf life of the video by retaining the capacity to update certain elements within the video without having to do a complete re-render of the job.  Along those lines, the optin has to remain open for later production of the entire video in high definition if NASA has interest and resouces to do so. 8.  In what format should copies of the digital files by provided to NASA? The digital files delivered to NASA must be, as specified in the statement of work, in either uncompressed or losslessly compressed files.  The files may be in any industry standard format. 9.  Will the contractor need to provide luma key, chroma key, picture in picture and like edits? There may be some picture in picture or superposition work required in working with the graphic or data visualization elements provided by NASA, depending upon the scope and script of the video.  It is not likely that there will be a need for any chroma key or luma key or super impose work.  Include a paragraph highlighting the contractor's technological capabilities and work experience in that type of work. 10.  What are the criteria for selection? Contractors should articulate their previous work experience, particularly where revelent to the Terr a video product.  They should summarize the video editing and production expertise of the personnel.  They should describe their technological capabilities, highlighting any leading-edge technologies that they feel may be particularly advantageous to NASA in this project.  Estimated cost will also be a primary factor in selection. 11.  Should proposals include a sample of work? While a demonstration sample is not required, contractors are encouraged to submit a sample of their work on CD, DVD, or VHS tape. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to January 17, 2003. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<ARCHDATE>03292003
<CONTACT>Jeffrey Bean, 586-574-7860
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Tank-automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) announces the availability of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) number DAAE07-03-Q-BAA1 dated 20 December 2002. TARDEC is seeking innovative technologies, efforts, and projec ts in a variety of topic areas that (a) offer a capability that is a superior, innovative, or a unique solution to a military need, problem or challenge; and (b) will benefit agency programs, and/or contribute to the accomplishment of the Army's mission, a nd/or have a commercial application or other public benefit. Topic areas are listed alphabetically and are not in any order of importance. Technical approaches that provide an integrated solution in multiple topic areas may be submitted, but you must ident ify a single lead topic for your white paper and/or proposal submission.       A BAA is a form of solicitation authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulation when the government wants to fund certain forms of research and development. The BAA is issued to solicit competitive proposals against a range of topics, and is expected to l ead to award of one or more contracts or agreements for the conduct of basic or applied research or that part of development not related to development of a specific system or hardware as defined in FAR 2.1 and FAR 35.001. The topics covered by this BAA ar e listed in Part V of the announcement.  Unlike the structure of many government competitions, the evaluation of proposed projects per this BAA will be conducted in two phases, as follows: (1) In the FIRST PHASE, companies interested in participating in the BAA submit a document called a 'white paper.' A white paper is a three to five page brief abstract or summary of the proposed project. It gives a synopsis of the project but does not incl ude the full technical and cost detail, or the back-up information, that would be a part of a complete proposal. All white papers received will be subjected to peer and scientific review. The submission of white papers is a step designed to preclude compan ies from incurring the effort and expense of preparing full technical and cost proposals, for projects having little chance of being funded. (2) In the SECOND PHASE, companies whose white papers show the most promise are issued a written invitation by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to submit a complete technical and cost proposal for the planned project. During this second phase, a Gov ernment evaluation team will review all proposals, and evaluate and rate each against the evaluation criteria set forth in the announcement and rank and rate each proposal within each topic. Proposals will be selected for award, consistent with the availab ility of Government funding, based on a source selection assessment as described in Part VIII below. Negotiations may be conducted to enhance the Government's evaluation process. Program funding is currently not available for this effort. Due to Government budget uncertainties, funding for awards is currently pending and the amount available for award is estimated to be the amounts shown against each of the topics. The number of pr ojects and the final dollar value of each project will depend on the total funds available. The BAA provides further information on the above areas of interest, white paper format, proposal format, submission instructions, evaluation process and criteria a nd other information. White papers must be received not later than 1500 hours local time (3:00PM EST) on January 28, 2003. The BAA may be electronically downloaded from TACOM's website at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/baapage.htm  If you have any questions, please get in touch with Ms. Harriet Marcet, marceth@tacom.army.mil, or (586) 574-5573.

<DESC>Amendment 01 to Sources Sought Notice. The response date is extended to 21 February 2003. Here are some questions received and our responses: 1) Can we recharge during the 30 seconds between the two one second pulses in a burst? Yes. 2) How much recharge power is available at 700 VDC and 450 VAC? Assume 110A @ 700 VDC or 175A @ 450 VAC. 3). Is circulating cooling water available and at what temperature? Chilled water is available at 65 plus or minus 2 degree F. 4) In the description it says that recharging is not allowed during the pulse discharge. I assume this means recharging can not occur in the 1 second discharge time and that recharging can occur in the 30 seconds between the two pulses and during the 5 minute intervals between pulses. This interpretation is correct. The only time that recharging is not allowed is during the 1 second discharge. NAICS: 335911. There is no solicitation associated with this notice.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army, Fort Bragg, North Carolina is seeking to enter into Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with responsible sources for the supply and delivery of natural gas.  It is the Army's intent to issue BOAs to multiple Gas Providers/Marketers for the supp ly and delivery of natural gas.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.  A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  All offerors must reference Request for Proposal (RFP) number DABK07-03-R-0003.

<DESC>The Department of State (DOS) has a continuing requirement for providing doors, windows, opaque panels and glazing panels to U. S. Diplomatic and Consular Missions overseas that have been DOS certified for forced entry (FE) and ballistic resistant (BR) protection. The DOS has established a qualified manufacturers list (QML) but DOS wants to continue to promote competition by increasing the number of qualified manufacturers for our FE/BR requirements. Hence, the following information is provided to interested manufacturers. Prior to DOS certification, each product must be tested by an independent test facility to meet DOS standards for a specified level of FE and BR protection. We currently utilize the following different FE/BR ratings: 5-minute FE, 15-minute FE/BR and 60-minute FE/BR. Products required for 5-minute FE protection include: doors with glazing panels, opaque doors, opaque door pairs, door pairs with glazing panels, fixed windows and teller windows with deal tray. Products required for 15-minute FE/BR protection include: doors with glazing panels, doors with glazing panel and deal tray, opaque doors, opaque door pairs, door pairs with glazing panels, fixed windows, teller windows with deal tray, opaque panels, transparent panels, and combination opaque and transparent panels. Products required for 60-minute FE/BR protection include: opaque doors, opaque door pairs, louvers and roof hatches. The standards and requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified are found in the following documents: Department of State (DOS) standard, SD-STD-01.01 (latest revision), Certification Standard for Forced Entry and Ballistic Resistance of Structural Systems, and requirements provided in the Office of Foreign Buildings Operations (FBO) Architectural & Engineering Design Guidelines for U. S. Diplomatic Mission Buildings Master-Guide-Spec, Section 08318 - Forced Entry (FE)/Ballistic Resistant (BR)Door Assemblies, Section 08661 - Exterior Security Windows, Section 08667 - Interior Security and Teller Windows, Section 08845 - Security Glazing, Section 13026 - Security Modular Panels, Section 10211 - Security Louvers, and Section 07727 - Forced Entry (FE)/Ballistic Resistant (BR) Roof Hatches. The specifications for these products are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of this qualification requirement. At a minimum, each manufacturer must have the following 15-minute FE/BR products tested and DOS-certified prior to any award of contract: door with glazing, opaque door, door with glazing panel and deal tray, fixed window, and teller window with deal tray. It is extremely difficult to mix manufacturers on one project due to different appearance, frame materials, finish materials and coordination of bolt holes if two different manufacturers frames are to bolted together. Therefore for large projects we would utilize one manufacturer for all products unless the products are not physically located in close proximity to distinguish physical differences.   All requests for copies of these specifications and standards must be in writing and submitted to U.S. Department of State, DS/PSP/PSD, Attn: Dusty Rhodes, SA-14, Washington DC 20520-1403 with an information copy attached for A/OPE, Rm. 603, SA-6, Washington, DC 20522-0602.  Mr. Rhodes may be contacted at (703) 312-3144. The DOS has awarded contracts subject to this qualification requirement since fiscal year 2000. When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin. The manufacturer is responsible for arranging, scheduling and paying for the tests conducted by an independent laboratory that has been approved by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Physical Security Programs, Physical Security Division (DS/PSP/PSD). The following test facility has been approved for certification testing: H.P. White Laboratory, Inc., 3114 Scarboro Road, Street, Maryland 21154-1822, (410) 838-6550.

Prior to DFAS, DoD performed finance and accounting functions at various installations/activities using non-standard systems and procedures.   Over the years DFAS consolidated from 338 offices to 26, reduced manpower by 9,200 positions, reduced systems from 324 to 65, reorganized into business line structure, and received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements for fiscal year 2000, 2001 and 2002.  

DFAS consists of three major business lines, one being Accounting Services.   The Accounting Services Business Line is responsible for providing responsive, professional finance and accounting service to the Department of Defense by making payments and collections, recording financial events, classifying, summarizing, and reporting the results of business transactions in financial (monetary) terms, as well as budget execution, and analyzing the results of these processes.

This Request for Information (RFI) fact sheet provides an overview of Marine Corps' accounting as performed by DFAS.

Marine Corps accounting is a separate product line under the Accounting Business Line.  It is primarily performed by the DFAS Kansas City site located in Kansas City, Missouri.  Some Marine Corps accounting functions are also performed by DFAS sites located in Honolulu, Hawaii and Yokota, Japan.   These remote accounting functions are subsidiary to and feed into the accounting processes executed at Kansas City.  Customers are represented by 32 Marine Command Elements and the units they are comprised of.  DFAS Kansas City, as the Client Executive, is responsible for ensuring that the Marine Corps customer needs are met, regardless of where the accounting is performed.

The major functions encompassing Marine Corps accounting consists of:

- Field level which include budgetary and proprietary accounting, reporting and accounting statement preparation for all funds (general/appropriated, working capital, revolving trust) executed by the Marine Corps.  As a minimum, this would include accounting for plant, property and equipment and other elements of expense, accounts payable, accounts receivable, cash accountability, funds authentication.

- Departmental Accounting/Reporting involves the consolidation and roll-up of trial balances and subsidiary accounts into consolidated Marine Corps reports.  The consolidated reports are submitted to another DFAS site at Cleveland, Ohio (not part of Marine Corps accounting) that subsequently consolidates the Marine Corps information into the Department of Navy (DoN) financial statements.

- Disbursing, which is charged with safeguarding US funds through delivery of payments and receipt of collections; providing prompt, accurate ant timely disbursing services, and reporting accountability to the Department of Treasury

- Management and continual improvement of Accounting processes:

- Accounting systems maintenance and support used to accomplish capturing, transmitting, analyzing, recording and reporting accounting transactions

- Accounting procedures and guidance

- Electronic Commerce and Business Process Improvement Initiatives

- Customer Service and Business Management

For purposes of this RFI, specific accounting functions can be categorized in 13 general areas as follows:

- Maintain General Ledgers - involves receiving and processing data for general ledgers, validating incoming data, performing follow up concerning missing reports and/or data; recording home office and departmental level entries, providing assistance to the field sites, explaining balance issues, submitting final reports, preparing journal vouchers.

- Perform Funds Control - Budgetary Accounting - involves recording obligations, monitoring fund availability, recording expenditures, reconciling fund targets, monitoring reimbursable orders, recording commitments.

- Maintain Accounts Receivable - involves preparing billings, recognizing revenue (establish estimates), establishing receivable/maintain and update account information, recording collections, managing delinquent debt, managing advances, managing unfunded reimbursables.

- Maintain Accounts Payable - involves recording the payment, accruing liabilities, recognizing liabilities and establishing payables, processing payments, maintaining electronic fund transfer data, conducting unliquidated obligation (ULO) reviews, processing billings

- Maintain Inventory Accounting - involves reconciling inventories, processing adjustments, updating inventory, reviewing and validating end of month/year inventory reports, validating and adjusting sales of inventory.

- Perform Property, Plant and Equipment - involves reviewing and validating end of month/year fixed asset reports, preparing journal vouchers for property/plant/equipment, receiving incoming data for property/plant/equipment, reconciling data.

- Perform Payroll Accounting - involves processing payroll data and accruing wages.

- Perform Non-Appropriated Accounting (limited) - involves a limited performance of general accounting functions for non-appropriated funds.

- Maintain Cost Accounting - involves performance of cost accounting and monitoring cost accounting.

- Generate Accounting Reports - involves receiving and processing data for accounting reports, recording installation, departmental, agency, entries for accounting reports, creating installation, departmental and agency accounting reports, providing customer assistance, accumulating information for accounts receivable report, providing trust fund accounting reports, and providing ad hoc financial information reports to the military services, Defense Agencies, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) organizations, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Treasury or Congress. 

- Maintain Cash Reporting - involves processing departmental and detail cash reporting, resolving problem disbursements.

- Perform Disbursing Activities - involves the processing, payment and collection of monies, bond processing, accountability of funds management, field liaison and training, voucher control/balancing/payroll reconciliation. 

- Perform Manual work-arounds - involves performing system and process work arounds.

As previously stated, outside of the above 13 general areas, are functions related to the management and continual improvement of the accounting process.  This includes accounting systems maintenance and support, accounting procedures and guidance, electronic commerce and business process improvements.

The Standard Accounting Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS) is the system used to support Marine Corps general fund accounting.  The system is on one database and supports all Marine Corps accounting, with a number of interfaces to Marine Corps specific systems as well as DoD migratory systems.  Data is interfaced to SABRS and in return data is transferred back to originating systems.  SABRS is a mainframe system which is supported by the DFAS Kansas City Technical Services Office for programming and systems maintenance, with mainframe support by the Defense Enterprise Computing Command (DECC) St. Louis, Missouri.   

A couple of the major inputs and outputs of the SABRS system involves the interface of data from the DOD Standard Procurement System (SPS) for which SABRS receives contractual data and extracts the obligation data for itself and contractual data for the Computerized Accounts Payable Systems Windows (CAPSW) to facilitate vendor payments.  The Civilian Personnel Resource Reporting System (CPRRS) provides labor distribution reporting for Marine Corps actives worldwide.  SABRS provides the labor expense data biweekly to CPRRS to meet this requirement.  The Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) provides all labor reporting data biweekly for payment of all defense civilian employees.  SABRS records commitment, obligation and expense data according to the information provided by DCPS in addition to specific personnel data.  The Supported Activities Supply System (SASSY) is a Marine Corps owned supply management system that supplies obligation, expense and inventory management data to SABRS.  SABRS in turn provides financial status data to SASSY.  Both interfaces exchange data daily.  The Standard Finance System (STANFINS) Redesign Subsystem - 1 (SRD - 1) provides disbursement/collection data to SABRS on a daily basis.  SABRS in turn provides obligation data to SRD1 to support the disbursement data processed by SRD - 1.

Defense Working Capital Fund Accounting is supported by the Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) and the Marine Unified Materiel Management System (MUMMS).

Disbursing is supported by the STANFINS Redesign Subsystem - 1 (SRD -1) and other minor systems.  The process of entitling payments occurs outside Disbursing and where automated uses multiple +systems.  The support of these various systems and interfaces resides with a number of DoD entities.

<SUBJECT>Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) acquisitions for Maintenance and Imaging Industry Day
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization will host an Industry Day for the VA's upcoming Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) acquisitions for Maintenance and Imaging.  All small and large businesses interested in this acquisition are encouraged to attend this important event. The NAIC number is 541519  Other Computer Services  size Std $21million.  The VistA Industry Day will be held on Wednesday, January 22, 2003, beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association Building (AFCEA), 4400 Fair Lakes Court, Fairfax, VA 22033-3899.  It is the intent of the VistA Industry Day to bring both small and large businesses together to hear from the Contracting Officer and Senior Program Officials about the VistA acquisitions, including tentative milestones for this acquisition as well as providing firms in attendance with an opportunity for interactive discussions with program officials and to network and explore teaming and subcontracting arrangements with other potential vendors.  The VistA Acquisitions will be issued as two separate solicitations.  The first solicitation will cover the VistA maintenance and will be issued using full and open competition.  VistA imaging requirement will be issued under a separate solicitation as a total small business set-aside.  Both solicitations are scheduled to be released after January 22, 2003.  VA's Chief Information Office introduced VistA in 1996.  It is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff.  VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  The Decision Support System (DSS) and other national databases that might be derived from locally generated data lie outside the scope of VistA.  When development began on the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) in the early 1980s, information systems were in their infancy in VA medical facilities and emphasized primarily hospital-based activities. DHCP grew rapidly and is used by many private and public health care facilities throughout the United States and the world. Although DHCP represented the total automation activity at most VA medical centers in 1985, DHCP is now only one part of the overall information resources at the local facility level.  VistA incorporates all of the benefits of DHCP as well as including the rich array of other information resources that are becoming vital to the day-to-day operations at VA medical facilities. It represents the culmination of DHCP's evolution and metamorphosis into a new, open system, client-server based environment that takes full advantage of commercial solutions, including those provided by Internet technologies. More information can be obtained on VistA at the following URL address:  www.va.gov/VistA_monograph. Directions to AFCEA can be obtained by calling 703-631-6100 or from Internet resources such as mapquest.com (http://www.mapquest.com).  Participants are requested to enter the AFCEA Auditorium from the entrance on the side of the building.  Parking is available at no charge.  Seating for this event is limited and participation is limited to two individuals per firm.  To register for the VistA Industry Day, please contact Mr. Ramsey Alexander, Jr., or Ms. Ilene Waggoner, Senior Procurement Analysts, telephone 202-565-8133 or 202-565-8127, respectively, or toll-free from outside the Washington Metropolitan Calling Area, at 1-800-949-8387.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source.
<DESC>The Veterans Administration, Health Revenue Center, (HRC) Topeka, KS intends to award a sole source purchase order for Disaster Recovery Services to Sungard Planning Solutions, Wayne, PA,  IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1).  The VA HRC presently operates a nationwide call center and desktop IVR system that supports the Veterans Administrations proprietary Employee Self Service personnel benefits system for 230,000 VA employees nationwide.  The VA HRC has previously contracted with Sungard for continuity of operations in the event of any kind of natural or unnatural disaster.  Sungard is the only known provider that maintains a fully operational hot site and cold site for disaster recovery services that is geographically feasible to our locale.  This contract action is a follow on action to a previously synopsized requirement for disaster recovery services and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The sole source purchase order provides for hardware, software, access to 54 workstations, high-speed data lines,  testing, and connectivity between the hot/cold sites, the Ameritech PBX switch located in Chicago, IL., the HRC, and the mainframe located in Austin, Texas.  The HRC is currently in the process of changing from the VA=92s proprietary Employee Self Service system to the Office of Personnel Management's Employee Express system.  It is anticipated that once this transition is complete this service will no longer be required.  This sole source award will be made to obtain approximately seven months of additional disaster recovery service. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination to conduct a competitive procurement will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Responses related to this notice shall be in writing and must be received no later than January 21, 2003.  POC is Barry Fetzer, Contracting Officer, VA HRC, 3401 SW 21, Bldg 9, Topeka, KS 66604.
