<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083832228     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with the Idaho Department of Water Resources to develop a work plan for the Boise Valley Water Use study modeling framework and database. The Bureau of Reclamation has recently begun a nationwide program of Water 2025. The focus of the program is on the increasing competition for water in the American West. The importance of this program is evident by increased conflict among competing water users compounded by the ongoing western drought. Emphasis is being placed on improved water management using conservation, increased efficiency, collaboration, technology, and market principles. Better water management is becoming increasingly important as demand for water grows. Reclamation has initiated a Boise Valley Water Use Study  (BVWUS) to address current and future water supply issues and analyze alternative scenarios for meeting present and future water needs in the Boise Valley. To accomplish this study Reclamation is collaborating closely with IDWR to take advantage of their models, technical  expertise and to avoid duplication of effort. Several models already exist in the ownership of IDWR and Reclamation that will be utilized in the modeling framework.  Reclamation coordinates closely with IDWR on water management issues and water use information in the state of Idaho.  Reclamation needs IDWR water information to be accessible, technically current, and accurate to enable reclamation to manage the distribution of federal water supplies in the state.  These improvements will also facilitate efficient water use of the limited state and federal water supply which will contribute to Reclamations ability to meet ESA and other federal environmental laws. This contract is to develop a work plan for the Boise Valley Water Use Study Modeling Framework. The work plan will include overall functional and system requirements, followed with detailed task-by-task descriptions that are required for the development of the overall modeling framework, with a proposed cost estimate for implementation of the work plan.  The task descriptions will include specific objectives of each task, the approach taken, any assumptions or risks associated with the task, and the deliverable of that task.  Additionally each task will be merged into a time schedule (MicroSoft Project) synchronized with other adjacent and subsequent tasks.   IDWR is the State Water Resource Agency which has the state responsibility to administer water rights and managing water resources in the state of Idaho.  There is no other state agency or private company that possesses the same legal authority for water rights management in the state of Idaho. Models  developed by IDWR will be used in this study and are not commercially available. The IDWR is the primary source in the State of Idaho for Geographic Information System and other digital land use, irrigation system, crop type, water use, water right, climate, soil, and other  IDWR proposes to pay for 50% for the cost of this contract. Reclamation intends to negotiate the contract using less than full and open competition procedures.  The period of performance for this contract will be contract award through December 2003.  No solicitation is available.   Parties who believe they have knowledge of the Boise Valley Water Use Study issues sufficient  to develop a modeling framework and database workplan  may send an SF254/255 demonstrating their firm's qualifications to the address listed above.   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

<SUBJECT>R--Provide agriculture related non-point sources (agriculture land, owner/operators, irrigation interests, and range land owners/operators) information needed to actively engage in water quality markets.
<SOLNBR>03SQ1100047
<RESPDATE>090403
<ARCHDATE>08202004
<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083832228     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with Ross and Associates Environmental Consulting, Ltd, to develop information needed to actively engage agricultural related non-point sources in water quality markets. In January 2003, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a Water Quality Trading Policy enabling and supporting the adoption of market-based programs for improving water quality.  The policy specifically enables and endorses the use of water quality trading to accelerate compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA). Reclamation has the opportunity to participate in water resource planning activities through the Geographically Defined Program (GDP) authorized under the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902.  The GDP directives and standards allow Reclamation to participate in emerging problems, issues, and needs as they occur in the area of water resources.  Reclamation's water projects are subject to the CWA and Total Minimum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements.  Reclamation is participating in the development of innovative approaches, including effluent or water quality trading, to help water users meet federal laws and regulations while using project waters. Water quality trading is a business-like way of focusing on cost-effective, local solutions to problems caused by pollutant discharges to surface waters.  In typical water quality trades, a party facing relatively high pollutant reduction costs compensates another party to achieve an equivalent, though less costly, pollutant reduction.  Water quality trading has been discussed as a potential tool to tackle a variety of water quality issues found in watersheds around the country.  Its flexibility is one of its strongest selling points.  However, the various stakeholders have very little experience in trading.  In addition, there are limited resources available to non-point sources designed to educate them on water quality trading, what makes trading work, and the processes used to trade.  This lack of information may suppress trading activity beneficial to individual dischargers as well as the watershed as a whole. Under this contract, the vendor will produce educational materials that will educate non-point sources and other stakeholders about water quality trading.  This will require consultation with pertinent agencies, directly or indirectly, engaged with watershed stakeholders.  In addition it will be important to interact directly with non-point sources to understand their depth of trading knowledge, the information they need to actively engage a market, and the form of presentation that is likely to be accessed and used by these dischargers.  Providing information in various forms will increase potential contact with point sources and potentially increase the number of non-point sources participating in water quality trading markets.  Under this contract, the vendor will produce the following materials: 1) A "Dummy Trade Booklet" focused on the steps and processes used in the Lower Boise Water Quality Trading Pilot Project; 2) A tri-fold brochure giving a brief introduction to water quality trading and the role non-point sources can play in an active market; and 3) A website providing non-point sources and other watershed stakeholders with information on water quality trading, the factors making trading viable in a specific watershed, and how to engage other stakeholders in the market. Water quality trading pilot project is a new innovative, alternative way to comply with federal, state and local water quality regulations.  Water quality trading is an extremely technical and complicated concept.  The Lower Boise Watershed Trading Demonstration project developed the process and frame work documents for Idaho Department of Environmental Quality for trading credits.  A "dummy trade" booklet and brochure for the Lower Boise Water Quality Trading pilot project have never been developed.   Reclamation intends to negotiate the contract using less than full and open competition procedures.  The period of performance for this contract will be contract award through February 28, 2004.  No solicitation is available. Parties who believe they have knowledge to develop a Water Quality Trading "dummy trade" booklet  may send an SF254/255 demonstrating their firm's qualifications to the address listed above.   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

<SUBJECT>B--DEVELOP RELATIONAL DATABASE FOR THE IDWR WATER RIGHTS ACCOUNTING MODEL
<SOLNBR>03SQ1100071
<ARCHDATE>08202004
<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083832228     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with the Idaho Department of Water Resources to develop a relational database for the IDWR Water Rights Accounting Model in the State of Idaho. The IDWR water rights accounting system is used during the irrigation season to determine and record the amount of water used by individual water rights from natural flow and storage and shut off water distribution when the right can no longer be filled. The accounting results are used by water managers to decide how to best use the water available to them. During the irrigation season the water master or IDWR staff may run the accounting model daily.  The water rights accounting model requires data on stream flows, diversions, reservoir contents, water rights, and the structure of the river network. The model is run daily or near real time so daily flow values and reservoir contents are required. The flow data is obtained from several sources including the U.S.B.R. Hydromet and AGRIMET systems, the U.S.G.S. stream flow measurement program, Idaho Power Co., and individual canal companies. Water rights data are contained in the IDWR Enterprise Water Management Database. Modifications are required to the Enterprise database so that the data needed by the accounting model can be retrieved electronically. The goal of this proposal is to significantly improve the day to day management and distribution of water in Idaho by making critical stream flow and diversion data readily available to all State and Federal agencies and water users.  The proposed database would make the water rights accounting model data and results more accessible to State and Federal agencies and the public and easier to support by IDWR. The proposed database would make it easier to integrate the accounting model with water rights information from the water rights database, flow measurement locations and river network structure, and basin maps from the GIS databases. Integrating the accounting model with the Windows operating system would make both the input data and the model results available to the public which would allow canal companies, irrigators, and State, Federal, and other agencies to enter data and closely monitor water demand and supply from Idaho's rivers. The purpose of this contract is to describe the tasks leading to the development of a publicly assessable database for stream flow, diversion data, and other data required for water administration and improvement and expansion of the IDWR water rights accounting model. The scope of work will create a database and applications to support three river basins where the accounting model is being used: Upper Snake River, Payette River, and Boise River.  The database design would allow new river basins to be added later.  IDWR proposes to pay for 50% of the cost of this work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Idaho Department of Water Resource (IDWR) is the state agency which has the state responsibility to administer water rights and manage water resources in the state of Idaho.  There is no other state agency or private company that possesses the same legal authority for water rights management in the state of Idaho. IDWR developed the water accounting model that is the focus of this work, it is not a commercially available. The IDWR is the primary source in the State of Idaho for Geographic Information System and other digital land use information including, irrigation system, crop type, water use, water right, climate, soil, and other associated data that will be needed to configure  models for water resource accounting and planning.  Reclamation intends to negotiate the contract using less than full and open competition procedures.  The period of performance for this contract will be contract award through December 2003.  No solicitation is available.

<SUBJECT>B--SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT FOR RETURN FLOW DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM IN SOUTHERN IDAHO
<SOLNBR>03SQ110170
<RESPDATE>090403
<ARCHDATE>08202004
<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083832228     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole-source contract with the Idaho Department of Water Resources to maintain the return flow collection Program in southern Idaho and in particular the Snake River drainage above Milner Dam. In Idaho, the administration of water is the responsibility of the Idaho Department of Water Resources, (IDWR) and the delivery of water to irrigators is the joint responsibility of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and numerous local water delivery organizations (irrigation districts and canal companies)  There is no other State agency or private company that possesses the same legal authority on water management in the State of Idaho.  IDWR is the primary source in the State of Idaho for Geographic Information System and other digital land use information, including: irrigation system, crop type, water use, water right, climate, soil and other associated data that will be needed to configure models for water resource accounting and planning. The proposed contract will help ensure that water is administered and delivered efficiently by Federal, state, and local water resource organizations.  To ensure that water is administered and delivered efficiently water resource organizations need to be able to readily acquire and use a common source of water use data. This contract will allow water managers at the Federal, state and local level increase their ability to account for water use on a daily and seasonal basis. Reclamation coordinates closely with Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) on water management issues and water use information in the State of Idaho.  Reclamation needs IDWR water return flow data to be accessible, technically current, and accurate to enable Reclamation to manage the distribution of Federal water supplies in Idaho.  These improvements will facilitate efficient water use of the limited state and Federal water supply which will contribute to Reclamation's ability to meet ESA and other Federal environmental laws.                                                                                                              The information technologies and approach that will be used in this project have already been developed by Idaho Power and are currently being utilized by IDWR.  The benefit to the project of using the information technologies already in place at IDWR is that 1) the project management system is already in place, 2) the database system proposed to be used (Hydromet) is familiar to most water users and represents a common platform for accessing the data, and 3) the investment that IDWR has in its water-right accounting and planning models will further benefit users of those business processes.   This program is authorized through the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902.  In addition, IDWR proposes to pay for 50% of the cost of this work.  Reclamation intends to negotiate the contract using less than full and open competition procedures.  The period of performance of the contract will be contract award through fiscal year 2004.  No solicitation is available.   Parties who believe they have knowledge of the above return flow data collection issues sufficient to provide maintenance for the return flow data collection program may send an SF 254/255 demonstrating their firm's qualifications to the address listed above. No phone or fax inquiries will be considered.

The work includes construction to alter building spaces to accommodate system components and to place conduits, wiring and appurtenances.  The installed system must be capable of using key cards issued locally or by the Andover system installed at the main campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Maryland.  A fixed price contract is contemplated.  The estimated magnitude of the proposed contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.   This is a small business set aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 238210.  Size standard is $12.0 million.  Selection will be based on the combination of price and non-price related factors that, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, provide the best value.  The technical evaluation factors are approximately equal in importance to each other and, taken together, are approximately equal in importance to price.  The factors are: Experience and capability; Past performance; and Technical approach to the work.  Bid documents will be available, in hard copy only, on approximately September 2, 2003.  Distribution and reproduction of bid documents is limited to bona fide contractors intending to submit proposals.   See numbered note 1.

<DESC>NA Block 17.  The Department of Defense (DoD) request review and comment on the draft Defense Travel System (DTS) Travel Management Services request for proposal (RFP).  The RFP identifies a DTS requirement to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, material s, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform Official Travel Management services for DoD at CONUS/OCONUS Travel Areas that are set-aside strictly for small business and 8(a) participation. Travel management services are to be provided for authorized official travel performed by DoD travelers assigned to organizations in their respective Travel Areas. DoD has established approximately thirty-one (31) Travel Areas as Small Business Set-aside l ocations, six (6) of which is set-aside strictly for 8(a) qualified firms.  Award of multiple contracts from the solicitation is anticipated, with the potential to award one contract per Travel Area.  Multiple travel areas may be awarded  under one contrac t if doing so is in the best interest of the Government. The draft RFP for this solicitation will be released in September 2003.  The final RFP will be released in October 2003.   The Government anticipates awarding Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract(s) with a two year base period and three, one year option periods.  Services will be priced on a transaction fee basis. Optional services will  be priced on a monthly basis.  The SIC Code is 561510 with annual size standard of $3,000.000. A best value source selection process will be conducted with each offeror's proposal evaluated against Technical, Performance Risk and Price factors.  In making its final selection of contractors to perform CTO services, the Government's technical evaluati on will include (but not be limited to) an assessment of offerors' demonstrated ability to perform CBA reconciliation under controlled procedures. Interested vendors will be required to demonstrate their capability to validate passenger name record (PNR) data through their Global Distribution System  (GDS) to the Defense Travel System as a condition of receiving award of any requirement described in this notice.  This demonstration can be done from the offeror's own facilities, and will involve minimal time and cost to offerors. Those vendors who have already successfully completed the PNR validation process will not be required to redo this demonstra tion. Vendors interested in submitting a proposal for any of these requirements must contact the Government via email at DTSContracting@osd.pentagon.mil as soon as possible, but not later than October 31, 2003, to schedule this validation event.

(17)  The Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links System Program Office (TDL SPO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as part of its market research to gain knowledge of cost effective approaches for the development of the Joint Interface Control Officer Support System (JSS) and its integration into Multi-Service platforms.   The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but requests information for market research and planning purposes.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated and approved the JSS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and validated the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for the JSS.  ESC/DIV has been designated as Executive Agent (EA) for this effort.  The Joint Interface Control Office (JICO) Support System (JSS) herein after referred to as JSS Program is defined by the Technical Requirements Document (TRD) including the JSS Traceability Matrix.  Primary platforms being considered include command and control platforms within each service.  These platforms are specified in the TRD along with the projected interfaces. Interested sources responding to this RFI are requested to provide 3 specific examples of projects involving Land, Seas, and Air based Command and Control platforms for Multi-Service Users.  The main purpose of this RFI is the exploration of integration approaches, to include, but not limited to, system engineering design, engineering analysis, software development, software/hardware integration, system testing, certification testing support, training, operational exercise support, life cycle support concepts, and system installation support.  In addition, the schedule, all cost associated with this integrate approach, and tradeoffs for this activity as well as deliverables shall be included.  Please note the production quantities cannot be determined at this time.  The Government believes that significant development and life cycle cost savings can be realized by encouraging an experienced Integrator to team with experienced system developers to outline a low-cost approach.  The Government is soliciting industry input/information after review of the TRD,  Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), and the draft JSS overview (these documents will be available on the HERBB website)  The Government requests comments on all aspects of the TRD,  RTM, and draft JSS overview,  to include; deliverables, expected planning schedules, hardware/software development, testing, platform integration requirements, and life cycle sustainment. The Government requests that the contractors submit a response relative to type and level of effort that may be used to support this effort.  Responses to this RFI shall not exceed Twenty (20) pages .  Text will use font size of 12 or greater with one inch margins.  Responses to this RFI shall include the following information: (a) Description of suggested approach, including how the approach can be tailored to accommodate a variety of host platform architectures; (b) Description of existing products that would support proposed approach and if those existing products have been tested, certified and fielded by any Government agencies; (c) Brief description of capabilities that are included in the proposed products and how they work (including any performance specifications related to the RTM, etc); (d) Description of how proposed approach would meet the design objectives for JSS; (e) Description of proposed work plan, to include a documented Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate of the cost and schedule for this activity; and (f) Summary of respondent's datalink software integration experience.  Submittals are not to be considered offers that may be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Information for two current points of contact is requested and should include name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Contractor formats for the requested information are acceptable. This is not a request for proposals. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This is a Request for Information only and does not, by its issuance, restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse any costs for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this RFI. Please note that the HERBB will be the primary source of information for the JSS acquisition. Interested firms should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service.  Firms are reminded that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  Questions from interested sources will be entertained.  Responses are to be sent via email to Michael.Carroll@hanscom.af.mil referencing the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) Support System (JSS) project by 2 PM EST on September 10, 2003.   No other information will be furnished or requested at this time. Responses should focus on the above listed guidelines and objectives.  See Note 26.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  GSA will acquire the services of a Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) for the modernization of the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building, Seattle, Washington, under a multi-step advisory and best value source selection process.  A firm fixed price contract is contemplated comprised of a Pre-Construction Base item along with Optional Construction line items.  

CMc RESPONSIBILITIES:  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-Construction Services, all Construction, including relocation and protection of building occupants and cooperation in support of building operation; and Construction Phase Project Management and Administrative Services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design support and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  The CMc must maintain a team with experience and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly construction of the proposed project.  

BUILDING DESCRIPTION:  The Jackson Federal Building (JFB) opened in 1974.  It is an office building, housing multiple agencies.  All agencies are equipped with sensitive IT systems requiring absolute security.  Normal operation of all occupant systems and all building systems, including emergency-mode operation of emergency systems, must be maintained throughout the project.  The CMc shall provide full cooperation with GSA building operations staff to assure that occupants and operations are sustained without lapse during extended business operation hours.  The building occupies the hillside block between 1st and 2nd Avenues, and Madison and Marion Streets.  It is 36 stories plus basement and penthouse.  The 32+ story steel frame tower stands on a 5-story reinforce concrete base structure.  The steel frame is fire-protected, with asbestos containing material used for floors 5 through floor 30.  There are 22 elevators.  The HVAC system is predominantly dual-duct variable volume, with fully programmable electronic controls.  Return air is conducted through the ceiling space.  The building is fully sprinklered.  The fire alarm system provides emergency notification to the occupants, and automatic shutdown of the forced air systems.  Emergency mode operation includes limited service by activation of an emergency generator, and manual operation of a partial smoke management by the Fire Department.  Access to the building is carefully controlled for security purposes, and all project personnel must receive security clearance.  There will be no contractor parking on site and projects storage space on site is severely limited.  There may be simultaneous, separate construction contracts within the building. 

PROJECT SUMMARY:  Project will provide improvements to building infrastructure along with renovations to various areas within the building.  Project work consists of multiple Project Packages (PP); some interrelated with each other, some independent.  Three Prime Design teams were engaged to accomplish the design work for one or more Project Package (PP).  The PP numbering reflects this as follows: PP/11 – Building frame seismic structural work.  PP/12 – Elevator control systems, some elevator hardware, and structural work in the shafts – plus an elevator maintenance agreement.  PP/13 – ADA improvements for restrooms.  PP/14 – Repair or replace membrane and masonry of the exterior multilevel plaza.  PP/21 and PP/21A – Heating system conversion to Natural Gas.  PP/22 - Smoke management systems improvements.  PP/23 – Miscellaneous mechanical work.  PP/31 and PP/31A – Cafeteria kitchen, servery, and dining room modernization.  Project management details, including pricing, tracking, payment, and closeout will be conducted, as much as possible, by PP.  The maximum ECC (Estimated Construction Cost) is between $30-$40 Million.  As a potential price control measure GSA may opt to acquire the heat system conversion as an individual contract.   

CMc SELECTION PROCESS:  A negotiated, best value, fixed price contract under FAR15.101-1, will be used for selection of the CMc.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-Step (FAR15.202) and Source Selection Procedures (FAR15.3).  

STEP 1 Request for Qualifications (RFQ):  This step invites potential offerors to submit information based on criteria that allows GSA to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors.  GSA will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in future postings, and shall advise each respondent either that it will be invited to participate in the resulting acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor for this acquisition.  GSA will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  The Offerors are reminded that in accordance with FAR 15.202, notwithstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resulting acquisition.  Firms that do not submit a response to Step 1 will not be eligible to compete in the resulting acquisition (step 2).  The RFQ, selection criteria and submission date for Step 1 will be issued in a forthcoming posting. 

STEP 2:  The offerors who are invited to participate in the resulting acquisition will be issued a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will include additional selection criteria along with detail construction documents.

SB-SDB Participation:  Although this procurement is open to large business, small and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged o participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities.

INTERESTED FIRMS:  Are requested to provide a response of interest to this posting to wayne.benjamin@gsa.gov, request only that prime contractors provide a notice of interest.  ******Future postings will detail the response date and criteria elements for STEP1, Pre-Solicitation site visit and networking session.******

The government reserves the right to make either a single or split award for the above noted structures.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and non-price-related factors. (non-price-related factors are technical capability, past performance, delivery etc.) 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be  used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Of ficer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technica lly unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which ha s no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.  Relevant Past Performance in this instance is defined as prior experience with the Department of Defense and more specifically but not limited to the U.S. Navy, where similar structures have been provided. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction base d upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within th e time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This announcement is notice of a sole source procurement pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  A recent surge in Norfolk Naval Shipyard’s (NNSY) workload as a result of the post September 11, 2001 world events resulted in an unanticipated demand for heavy lift crane service which is expected to continue in the foreseeable future.  The Navy Crane Center (NCC), Lester, PA, intends to increase the quantity of 151-ton portal cranes that can be ordered under an existing contract (N62472-97-D-1643) with Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), Seoul, Republic of Korea, from one to two.  SHI is uniquely qualified to provide this crane with the established design criteria by the required date of August 2006 to support NNSY's mission requirements.  Funding for the procurement of this crane will not be available until the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 limiting the time after award to complete all work and deliver the crane to approximately 22 months.  No other known source would have sufficient time to design and build the crane to current Navy specifications, including NCC's detailed review and approval process, within the operationally constrained timeframe. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  A determination by the government to not compete the proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Inquiries may be submitted to Mr. William H. Wedler, Contract Specialist, email: wedlerwh@ncc.navfac.navy.mil <mailto:wedlerwh@ncc.navfac.navy.mil>.  SEE NUMBERED NOTE 22.

The composite pulse decoupling schemes must be freely programmable by the user and include the option for pulse shaping of the individual elements of the composite pulses.  All channels shall have identical specifications at low rf power levels, except that only one channel requires operation over the frequency range from 458 to 501 MHz (for 19F and 1H), and a minimum of three channels shall operate over the frequency range from 25 to 205 MHz (all other nuclei).
4)	The system shall include two 3-axis triple resonance (13C/15N/1H) triple gradient (x,y,z) 5-mm pulsed field gradient probehead for observation of 1H while decoupling 13C and 1N, include 2H lock, and the 900 pulse widths must be <8 microseconds for 13C and  <45 microseconds for 15N, and <70 ms for 2H, for an aqueous non-saline sample.  In addition, the 1H RF homogeneity of the triple resonance probehead must be such that a 8100 1H pulse (2 x 3600 + 900) retains at least 70% of the signal relative to a single 900 pulse, using an aqueous solution containing 2 mM sucrose in D20.  The 13C RF homogeneity must be such that after a 900 (1H)- 1/2JCH – 7200 (13C) pulse sequence the methyl signal for a sample of 13C-enriched acetate is attenuated by less than 30% relative to the 1H signal acquired with a 900 (1H) – 1/2J –00 (13C) pulse sequence.
5)	The 1H sensitivity specifications for the triple resonance pulsed field x,y,z, gradient 5 mm probeheads, using Wilmad-535 sample tubes shall be:  (i) ASTM 0.1% ethylbenzene > 900:1; (ii) 0.5 mg sucrose/ml D20 > 90:1; (iii) 0.5 mg sucrose/ml in 200 nM NaCl in D20 > 65:1
Specifications (ii) and (iii) shall be carried out using a single scan, the free induction decay shall processed with an exponential line broadening of 1 Hz, and the noise assessed over a 1 ppm width
6)	 The system shall be equipped with hardware and software for mapping the magnetic field profile within the sample in three orthogonal dimensions, and software for making the required homogeneity adjustments under computer control. The spectrometer shall be capable of doing this for samples dissolved in D2O and in H2O. The spectrometer shall also include the capability to automatically adjust the homogeneity of the magnetic field during the course of multi-hour experiments, which include pulsed field gradients, without interrupting the actual experiments or having any other noticeable effect on the acquisition process.
7)	 The system shall include a triple resonance inverse detection cryoprobe for 1H observe with 15N and 13C decoupling, a 2H lock channel and a z-gradient coil for the application of pulse field gradients. The cryoprobe shall meet the following specifications:

(i)	The 1H S/N ratio shall be &#8805;3000:1 for 0.1% ethylbenzene (over 200 Hz noise).
(ii)	The 1H S/N ratio on the anomeric proton of a 0.5 mg sucrose/ml D2O  sample shall be &#8805;300:1 (recorded with 1 scan, and processed with exponential line broadening of 1 Hz with the noise measured over 1 ppm).
(iii)	The 1H pulse width shall be &#8804;8 microseconds.
(iv)	The 13C pulse width shall be &#8804;13 microseconds
(v)	The 15N pulse width shall be &#8804;50 microseconds.
(vi)	 The 1H non-spinning lineshape on a 1% chloroform sample shall be &#8804;12/24 Hz              (0.55%/0.11%)
(vii)	The recovery of the magnetic field homogeneity shall be such that a signal acquired 200 ms after a 1 ms gradient applied simultaneously in the z direction at 50% of maximum power, differs by less than 3% from that acquired without the preceding gradient pulse.  This shall be measured for a sample of 2 mM sucrose in D2O solution, using 1 Hz exponential line broadening and identical phasing.
8)	 The pulse programming system shall permit implementation of user-developed pulse sequences and shall be capable of conducting all experiments published in the volumes 1-26 of the Journal of Biomolecular NMR. It shall be possible to specify at least 30 independent pulse sequence interval lengths and 30 pulse widths in a single pulse program.  The minimum interval length shall be no greater than 500 ns.  It shall be possible to specify each interval length in increments of 25 ns or less.  It shall be possible to write and execute pulse programs with at least 256 steps (without loops), with each step representing a time period during which any combination of pulses on the five channels is given.  The amplitudes and phases of the pulses shall be arbitrarily programmable, subject only to the resolution limits on the phase shifters and rf attenuators.  It shall be possible to include at least twenty loops within a single pulse program, with independent loop counters.  It shall be possible to nest loops.
9)	The console electronics shall be capable of 0.5 degree phase resolution, 0.1 Hz frequency resolution and a 90 dB attenuation range on all five channels. The RF phase shall vary by no more than 3&#730; over an attenuation range of 45 dB from full power.
10)	At any offset, the excitation profile of a 1H shaped pulse shall be within 50% from its theoretical profile, as tested for the residual HDO line in a D2O sample, for offsets of up to 10 ppm. At any offset, the excitation profile of a 15N or 13C shaped pulse shall be within 50% from its theoretical limit for offsets up to 100 ppm.
11)	 The console shall be able to pulse and observe 2H nuclei without physically recabling the console, and capable of applying 90&#730; 2H pulse widths of less than 65 microseconds.
12)	The long term pulse amplitude stability on all channels shall be &#8804; 1% and phase stability shall be better than 1&#730;, as measured over a 24 h period in a room where the temperature changes by less than 1.5 &#730;C. This phase stability is measured from the relative difference between 1D spectra, recorded with a 30&#730; flip angle pulse, at various times during a 24 h period. 
13)	The system shall be capable of performing spin lock experiments on the 5-mm triple resonance 3-axis gradient probeheads for up to 100 ms for 1H (&#61543;B1 = 12 kHz), up to 50 ms for the 13C channels (&#61543;B2 = 12 kHz for 13C), and up to 120 ms for the 15N channel (&#61543;B2 = 3 kHz for 15N), with droop &#8804; 2%, and total duty cycles (time with RF on divided by total time) of up to 5%, for a one-hour period.
14)	The console electronics shall permit application of user defined shaped pulses to operate independently on each of the available channels. The shaped pulses must allow a minimum of 16000 user-definable elements within a single pulse shape. The dynamic range of each channel for shaped pulses must be at least 70 dB total range with 0.1 dB resolution half range.
15)	 The system shall be capable of independent and simultaneous control over amplitude, frequency, phase and duration of pulses for all frequency channels and over internal real-time clock pulses for triggering of external devices. 
16)	The console shall be equipped with a digitizer of at least 16 bits allowing simultaneous sampling of the quadrature receiver channels for spectral widths of up to at least 125 kHz. The system shall also be capable of oversampling and digital filtering of the NMR audio signal. In addition, no DC offset correction in the time domain shall be required on data acquired with a single scan, independent of receiver gain setting.
17)	The system shall be equipped with a pulse program controlled pulsed field gradient power supply, capable of generating a field gradient along the z axis with a strength of at least 50 G/cm and at least 25 G/cm in the x and y directions, for the 5 mm probehead.  The recovery of the magnetic field homogeneity shall be such that a signal acquired 200 &#61549;s after a 1 ms gradient applied simultaneously in the x, y, and z directions at 50% of maximum power, differs by less than 3% from that acquired without the preceding gradient pulse.

<ARCHDATE>09282003
<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) will procure a Gas Laboratory Analysis and Traceability System. As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  Many of these regulations require sophisticated and adaptable emission measurement systems.  As a result, the EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles and engines.  In its role as a National Laboratory for the measurement of regulated emissions, and energy consumption, related to the transportation sector,  NVFEL plays a critical role in the standardization of those measurements.  To support that role, EPA seeks to purchase a combined analytical, data acquisition and database system to establish, document and control the official concentration, and NIST traceability, of internal gas standards and challenge standards.

<DESC>The Finance Board is seeking to acquire an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) System (i.e., risk management software) to serve as the infrastructure (i.e., software platform) to measure the market risk exposures of each of the FHLBanks. The base system software would be used to measure the market Value at Risk (VaR) of the FHLBanks, individually and as a group.

The base system will also be used to perform a comprehensive market-value-of-portfolio-equity (MVPE) sensitivity analysis. This includes generating “market value” reports showing the estimated present value of an institution’s portfolio under a variety of interest rate scenarios. The system must be capable of accurately and efficiently valuing and calculating risk analytics on a large number of fixed-income assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items. It is essential that all valuation and risk analysis be conducted using a lattice or Monte Carlo approach fully taking into consideration any embedded optionality, and incorporating implied volatility as a risk factor.

This is a firm fixed price contract except for software installation, user training, and technical support which are on a time and materials basis. For more information, contact David A. Lee, Senior Acquisition Official, Office of Management, Federal Housing Finance Board, 1777 F Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006, voice: 202/408-2514; facsimile: 202/408-2895; email: leed@fhfb.gov.

<DESC>The Malaria Vaccine Development Unit (MVDU), NIAID, has a mandate to develop the process for manufacture of pilot lots of clinical grade material of promising malaria vaccine candidate antigens; to produce clinical grade prototype malaria vaccines through collaborations or contract manufacture; to undertake Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity trials in the USA and undertake Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in populations endemic for malaria. The MVDU program has resulted in eight antigens that either have or are likely in the near future to be prepared as clinical grade antigens suitable for Phase 1 trials. Several other antigens are at an earlier stage of development and some of these are likely to become available during the contract period.  Depending on the results on Phase 1 trials of individual antigen and adjuvant combinations, it is expected that these antigens will progress to field testing as three combination vaccines, a mixture of four Plasmodium falciparum blood stage antigens, a mixture of two P. falciparum sexual stage antigens and a mixture of the same two P. falciparum sexual stage antigens with two P. vivax sexual stage antigens. These combinations must be tested in Phase I studies in the USA before they can be taken to an endemic area.  The following mandatory qualification criteria establishes a condition that MUST be met at the time of receipt of initial proposals by the Contracting Officer in order for the proposal to be considered any further for award:

The Offeror shall demonstrate that their facility where vaccines will be formulated and volunteers vaccinated is approximately one hour travel, and no more than 2 hours under heavy traffic conditions from the MVDU unit at Rockville MD. This requirement is to allow, if necessary, vaccines prepared as “point of injection formulations” either at the MVDU facility or at the contractor’s facility to undergo QC procedures at MVDU after formulation and prior to injection, while still meeting a 4 hour limit on the time from formulation to injection. This travel limit will also facilitate regular meetings between the Project Officer and other NIAID Investigators and the Offeror. The Government scientists must also have ready access to examine the volunteers and to receive labile clinical specimens (e.g. whole blood samples) obtained from these volunteers.

The Government contemplates awarding 1 cost-reimbursement type contract for accomplishing the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work for a period of seven (7) years.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DIR-04-01 will be available electronically on or about September 4, 2003, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:  NIAID/CMB Home Page (via the World Wide Web) use
http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract  to access the NIAID/CMB Home Page, then click on the Current RFP’s link, and select RFP NIH-NIAID-DIR-04-01.  Responses to this RFP will be due on December 16, 2003.  See Numbered Note 26.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Point of Contact:  Donald E.

However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A  determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a  sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620.  The anticipated award date is 8/15/03.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511210   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source contract with IBM for a 1 Engine z/VM Version 4 software license and one year of subscription and support. Also included is a license and one year of support for software products DirMaint, RACF, and Performance ToolKit.  EPA believes that IBM is the only source capable of providing these licenses and software support.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy  agency requirements".  The period of performance for the software support is expected to be from September 19, 2003 through September 18, 2004.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required tickets should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15  days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the  RFQ will not be honored.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This notice issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) 0032935, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) under Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 421490.  The provisions and clauses incorporated are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  This notice will result in an aggregate award for a Firm-Fixed Price, one-time buy.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Exploranium, 207 East Ohio Street, Suite 262, Chicago, IL  60611.  The requirement is as follows: The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Laboratory Division, Hazardous Material Response Unit have a requirement for forty (40) GR 135 miniSPEC IDENTIFIER Portable Gamma-Dose-Neutron Radiation Survey Spectrometer Systems.  The specifications for the new GR 135 miniSPECT IDENTIFIER Portable Gamma-Dose-Neutron Radiation Survey Spectrometer Systems are as follows:  (1) The systems must be rugged, lightweight, portable, handheld gamma-dose-neutron-spectrometer which can be operated with one hand, utilizes both common alkaline or rechargeable ni-cad batteries, as well as the ability to operate from 110V AC or 12V DC with a supplied power adapter; (2) Shall have an integrated, comprehensive, nuclide identification library and be able to interface with a personal computer for data downloads, analysis, and email forwarding to remote user locations; (3) Shall have a minimum of three different onboard detectors (Geiger-Mueller Tube, Sodium Iodide and Neutron); (4) Shall perform automatic stabilization using an integrated radiological check source which meets worldwide exemption limits to allow transportation and operation without an NRC license; (5)  Shall have the additional capabilities of:  preset, audible alarm levels; user selectable units of dose measurement (rem, gray, sieverts); backlight display for use in low light conditions; customizable nuclide identification libraries; automatic charging and self stabilization while in the docking/charging station.; and (6)  In addition to the specific requirements outlined above it is imperative that the systems be compatible with existing software and hardware configurations recognized, accepted and currently in use within the Bureau and other federal agencies.  The GR 135 miniSPEC IDENTIFIER has proven its capabilities in this role.  Specifically, the FBI, U.S. Customs Service, Department of Defense and Department of Energy have established protocols using the Exploranium GR 135s ability to identify, store, download to a computer, and email radioisotopic spectroscopy data through the federal Triage system.  The Triage program allows multiple users, to include nuclear scientists within the DOE Laboratory system, to analyze the data sent in from field operators anywhere in the world and provide real time, expert assessment and advice on the radiological hazards involved.  HMRU has a total of thirteen (13) GR 130 miniSpec detector systems (the predecessor to the GR 135) already in use.  These forty (40) GR 135 detector systems will be an upgrade to the original units and will include a trade-in of the thirteen (13) GR 130s towards the new GR 135s.  It is important to note that configuration and operation of the new GR 135s is virtually the same as the GR 130s. This provides the advantage of minimal additional training required for Bureau personnel already competent in the use of the older systems.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source.  Therefore, this notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, the Government will consider all quotes received by 4:00 p.m., EDT, on September 5, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Questions concerning this procurement should be directed to Deanna D. Davis at the above address and phone number (202) 324-5552.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Tel:703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: General Mayor Traian Basescu, Municipality of Bucharest, Bulevardul Regina Elisabeta nr. 47; Bucurest, Romania; Phone: (40) 21-310-3089; Fax: (40) 21-312-0030.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on the creation of an integrated information technology system for the Municipality of Bucharest and its municipal districts.

This project is the second phase of an IT strategy put forward by the Municipality of Bucharest to create an it system for the Municipality and its municipal districts. 

The Municipality of Bucharest is divided into six administrative-territorial subdivisions otherwise referred to as “Sectors” or “Regias.”  The local public administration authorities of Bucharest consist of the Bucharest General Municipal Council and the local councils of the six Sectors.  Due to the complexity of the municipal divisions, the principal Municipality of Bucharest, headed by the General Mayor of Bucharest, saw the need to create an integrated method of sharing data and organizing information to allow the government to be more responsive and efficient in handling everyday operations.  Therefore, the principal Municipality of Bucharest developed a three-phase strategy to deploy an integrated IT system. 

Phase I was designed to organize the Municipality’s current activities and structure information in a user-friendly format to allow the General Mayor to make better, more informed decisions.  The integrated IT system will allow management to obtain directly information in real time from databases throughout the Municipality.   Specifically, it allows access to the information systems of the following agencies:  The Finance Administration (including accounting and budgeting); Human Resource Department; The Housing Cadastre; Electronic Archives; Department of Public Administration; Public Utilities; Department of Transport, Roads, and Traffic Safety; and client relations databases. The principal Municipality of Bucharest has signed a contract for the implementation of Phase I.  

Phase II entails the expansion of the IT system developed and installed at the principal Municipality of Bucharest to the six municipal district offices, selected utilities, and other public service providers under the General Council of Bucharest.  The feasibility study would analyze the existing IT environment in each district office and determine the basic requirements for each office or agency to be integrated into the IT infrastructure of the principal Municipality.  The goal of this expansion project would be to ensure compatibility, to increase efficiency and to protect the integrity of shared data.

Upon the successful implementation of Phase II, the third phase would involve rolling out the system to the State Regias.  This plan would integrate the State Regias offices located in Bucharest into the overall system. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $257,120 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, September 30, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Carolyn Dickens, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-377-3607, Fax 202-275-0912, Email Carolyn.Dickens@ed.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education(ED)/Federal Student Aid intends to issue a sole source extension (by modification)to Contract No. PM95009001.  The period of performance would be extended for an additional 36 months, from April 1, 2004 through March 31, 2007.  The name of the contractor is: Pearson Government Solutions, 2450 Oakdale Blvd., Coraville, IA 52241. This contract provides for maintenance, operations, technical support, systems, software, testing, training, and documentation development for the Central Processing System.  The extension will cover the entirety of the 05-06 cycle, which includes 
development (Mar 04-Dec 04), production (Jan 05-Sept 06), and closeout (Sept 
06-Mar 07).  

ED believes that this contractor is the only responsible source that can satisfy this requirement.  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); 48 C.F.R. § 6.302-1.  Award of a contract to any other source to perform these services during this period would result in substantial duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through competition and also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling ED’s requirements.  ED is currently in the process of launching a Front End Business Integration initiative to identify opportunities for streamlining, integrating, and increasing value across the entire front of the student aid lifecycle.  In support of that initiative, ED is now in the acquisition planning and solicitation preparation phase (which will include market research) for the new, follow-on procurement.  That solicitation is expected to be released on or about February 28, 2004, with award of a contract scheduled for the fall of 2004.  To aid in the transition, the current CPS provider will work with the FEBI solution provider(s) through development of the 06-07 cycle year (Mar 05-Dec 06).
  
	The CPS system and its products are updated annually each processing cycle by the contractor. The contractor performs enhancements based on changes made to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and other forms.  Other changes to the system are made based on configuration management issues or requests received from outside entities such as schools, focus groups, the Advisory Board, the Office of the Inspector General (through audits), Office of Management and Budget (during the forms clearance process), or Reauthorization.
	
	The primary role of the CPS is to process the data received through a series of data checks, formula calculations and matches of data with other Federal agencies.  These matches are performed with entitities such as: Selective Service, Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, Prisoner’s Match, Department of Justice (Drug Abuse Data Base), and the Social Security Administration (SSN, citizenship, and Date of Death). The contractor is responsible for maintaining in CPS, a record of every application and correction submitted for Federal student financial aid. The CPS interacts with the numerous Federal systems mentioned above, thousands of schools, and millions of students in order to perform these functions. 

	The contractor is also responsible for the development and testing of the EDExpress Suite Software, the FAFSA/Renewal FAFSA on the Web applications and FAA Access to CPS Online.  The contractor also provides specifications to servicers who wish to develop their own third party (EDExpress-type) software and provides training on the various software packages to schools. This contractor is also responsible for receiving the paper FAFSAs, Renewal FAFSAs, SARs and other corrections, imaging them, capturing the data by both automated fashion (OMR, ICR) and manual key entry.   Data and images are transmitted to the Central Processing System (CPS).   Enhancements are made as needed and as required by changes made to the FAFSA and other forms. In the area of development, efforts in this area are directed toward 1) preparation for processing of Title IV data, and 2) the overall improvement of hardware/software capabilities and manual processing functions.  Development activities are initiated to accommodate changes to law, regulations, or policy; improve productivity; control cost; mitigate adverse aspects of data processing operations; simplify and enhance user interface; and respond to Title IV Program management needs regarding collection and dissemination of information relating to Title IV Program support services. The Department may, at its sole option, elect to issue one task order or a series of task orders under this contract for the accomplishment of certain activities relating to the capture, storage, manipulation and administration of Title IV program eligibility, participation and certification data.  In the area of testing, efforts are directed toward developing and executing a computer-based, structured systems test for pre-production testing of the Central Processing and Multiple Data Entry Systems.  In the area of Operations, efforts are directed toward the continuing operational capability of the Title IV Program support services.  Some of the specific activities in the area are 1) receiving and processing applicant data from the Image Data Capture (IDC) System and printing of appropriate output, 2) receiving and processing of applicant data submitted on Internet, 3) maintaining batch integrity for all documents and data received, and 4) maintaining an automated log file for all electronic transmissions received and sent. The Contractor also provides training for ED and Contractor personnel affected by the changes/results of the activities described above. 

	 The Contractor shall also provide training, as required, for other Title IV Contractor personnel, particularly staff of the Federal Student Aid Information Center under ED's Public Inquiry contract.  Specific activities shall include, but not limited to, developing procedure manuals and training materials; training Contractor staff, if required, in telecommunications transmission; conducting classroom-type presentations; and/or conducting on-the-job training sessions. 

	In terms of the Analytical Studies and System Development Activities requirement under the contract, the contractor is required to increase the overall responsiveness, accuracy, and effectiveness of the Title IV information system(s) and all related program and administrative functions.  

	This is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See Numbered Note 22.

	Interested parties should submit a capability statement at 4:00 p.m. EST on or before October 7, 2003 to the following address:  U.S. Department of Education, Contracts and Purchasing Operations, 830 First Street, NE, Suite 101H4 Washington, DC  20202, Attention:  Carolyn Dickens.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Progrm (CDP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Kaiser Permanente, 500 NE Multnomah Street, Suite 100, Portland, OR 97232, for the creation of a tissue microarry for research on pre-malignant colorectal disease for evaluation of prognostic markers.  The Cancer Diagnosis Program has the overall responsibility for planning, evaluation and coordination of NCI research related to cancer diagnostics.  Part of that responsibility is to facilitate research using human specimens and patient data to advance cancer diagnostics.  The NCI Program for the Assessment of Clinical Cancer Tests (PACCT) was developed by the Cancer Diagnosis Program to assure that promising cancer biomarkers are appropriately evaluated for their clinical utility.  PACCT has developed an intellectual construct for marker development and is in the process of developing the infrastructure needed to move the field of cancer diagnostics forward.  A critical part of that infrastructure is the development of sets of reference tissues for marker evaluation.  The availability of a colon benign disease tissue microarray would allow research on markers useful for early detection, identify targets for prevention and potentially increase our understanding of the biology of transformation from benign to malignant disease.  The work to be performed under this contract requires access to appropriate specimens to create the required tissue microarrays. The Kaiser Permanente health care system provides a unique resource of archival specimens and extensive data organized into one of the best run tumor registries in the United States.  Dr. Andrew Glass of Kaiser Permanente Northwest received supplemental funding to his Cooperative Breast Cancer Tissue Resource (CBCTR) cooperative agreement to access blocks and data from 440 colon cancer cases, 413 rectal cancer cases.   The blocks were evaluated by Kaiser pathologists who identified and marked the areas suitable for arraying.  The associated clinical data was collected for each of these cases.  In addition, this group has access to more than 1000 benign polyps of the colon from patients who also had colorectal cancer.  This order provides for the specimens, data and for organizing the polyp collection to allow the construction of a benign disease tissue microarray. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service and has the data base and samples as described above it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 4, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS 541990.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 13.105 - Synopsis and Posting Requirements, this is a combined synopsis/solicitation for services for The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (DOC/NOAA) on a competitive basis to meet the requirements of the DOC, International Trade Association (ITA) for a comprehensive review assessing the enduring affect of the Special American Business Internship Training (SABIT) program for its alumni.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration's Special American Business Internship Training (SABIT) Program, administers a program to train managers and scientists from Eurasia (countries of the former Soviet Union).  Training programs can take two different forms. The first type of program (Group Program) is a four-week session that invites approximately18 managers and scientists to the United States for industry-specific training.  The second SABIT program (Grants Program) covers a share of the costs for hosting Eurasian managers and scientists for three to six months of professional training with a specific U.S. host company.  Interns come from all countries of the former Soviet Union including: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine.  Examples of industries covered under the SABIT program include, but are not limited to: energy (oil and gas), pharmaceuticals, standards and certification, transportation infrastructure, aviation, environmental technologies (mining, wastewater and oil spill clean-up), food processing, energy efficiency/construction, hospital administration, tourism, information technologies (IT), and software development.  The purpose of this requirement is a comprehensive review assessing the enduring affect of the SABIT program for its alumni as per the attached summary of requirement.
Please submit a proposal for the work outlined in the attached.  Your proposal should address the period of performance for the work to be performed, technical approach, and price for performing the work.  The purchase order when awarded, will reflect a firm fixed price arrangement and will be awarded utilizing small purchase procedures.  FAR clause 52.213-4 Terms and Conditions - Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) is hereby incorporated by reference.  Your technical volume and cost volume should be separate. Please keep the technical volume under 10 (8 1/2 x 11) pages and the price volume should be completed in Excel. Submit electronically to the Contracting Specialist, at Thomas.howcroft@noaa.gov.  Also please submit a hard copy to Thomas Howcroft at DOC/NOAA, SSMC IV, Station 7440 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  Please submit any questions via email by Monday, August 25, 2003.  Please submit your proposal  no later than Friday, September 5, 2003 at 1:00 pm.   NOAA does not presently receive electronic funds transfer (EFT) information from the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system.  (See http://www.ccr.gov)  However, proposed changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR in order to receive payments after September 30, 2003.  Accordingly, the contractor warrants and agrees that it will or already has registered in the CCR before September 30, 2003.  Further, until such time as NOAA finalizes its exchange of EFT information with CCR, the vender warrants that its EFT information listed in its "Vendor Profile" form is accurate and complete.  The vender profile form may be access from the following URL: http://www.ofa.noaa.gov/%7Eamd/vendor_form.html.  This form shall be submitted electronically, and in hardcopy along with its offer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Requirements for Painting two 5,000-gallon Liquid Oxygen Storage Tanks.  

 Abrasive blasted- The abrasive blasting and application epoxy primer, MIL-P-23377, Type I, Class 2, or MIL-P-85582 (Water Borne Epoxy Primer), or MIL-P-53030 (Lead and Chrome Free, Water Reducible Primer), (MIL-C-85285 remains the topcoat).  The blasted surfaces will be in a near-white condition per Steel Structure Painting Council (SSPC-SP 10-85).  A Near-White Blast Cleaned Surface Finish is defined as one from which all oil, grease, dirt, mill scale, rust, corrosion products, oxides, paint or other foreign matter have been completely removed from the surface except for very light shadows, very slight streaks, or slight discolorations caused by rust stain, mill scale oxides, or sight, tight residues of paint or coating that may remain.  At least 95 percent of each square inch of surface area shall be free of all visible residue, and the remainder shall be limited to the light discoloration mentioned above.  The blast cleaned surface must be primed before any rusting occurs, otherwise the benefit of the near-white blast cleaning is lost.  Under normal atmospheric conditions it is best practice to prime within one hour of blast cleaning.   
The following areas are exceptions to blasting 
A.  Abrasive blasting will not be performed on surfaces where there is a danger of warping or distorting the base metal.  Sheet metal thinner than 0.0625 inch (U.S. Standard 16 gauge) will not be abrasive blasted.  
B.  Parts whose dimensions must be retained or parts with deep crevices, threads of machined surfaces will not be abrasive blasted.
C.  Areas were gaskets meet stainless steel tank components.  NOTE:  Teflon gaskets will be protected from sand blast material.  
D.  Stainless steel components, valves, piping, gauges and accessories will not be sand blasted.
Primer – Abrasive Blast.  Prime with two coats MIL-P-23377, Type I, Class 2, or MIL-P-85582 (Water Borne Epoxy Primer), or MIL-P-53030 (Lead and Chrome Free, Water Reducible Primer) 
Finish - Paint with two coats of MIL-C-85285.
Cleaning - The contractor is responsible for all waste material and will clean area back to original condition.  Contractor will remove all paint over spray and sand blast material upon completion of project.
Schedule - Contractor will paint one tank at a time.  Contractor will be notified by Air Force Representative when second tank will be ready for painting.  Second tank will be ready for painting approximately two weeks after completion of the initial tank.
Area Cleanliness - Adjacent areas will be clean at all times.  Contractor will be responsible for installing temporary shielding to enclose sand blast materials and over spray from exiting specific work area.
Work Schedule - Contractor will only be allowed to work Monday thru Friday from 0800 - 1600 hrs.  Contractor will be observed throughout entire process. 
Materials - Contractor will purchase all materials required to perform scope of work identified 
above.

<CONTACT>Gerald Guilbert, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-260-5004, Fax 202-205-5466, Email guilbertgl@state.gov
<DESC>Questions and Answers:

1) 	Q - How many and which Arabic websites does the Department of State intend to promote?  The solicitation mentions usinfo.state.gov and "Rebuilding Afghanistan."  Are there others under consideration?  Could you please provide accurate numbers?
	A - "Rebuilding Afghanistan" and usinfo.state.gov are the only websites the Department of State wishes to promote.  With respect to the usinfo site, several  Arabic language pages are available on the site.  These Arabic language pages are the portion of the site the Department wishes to promote.  On any given day, an average of five to six such pages are available on the usinfo website.

2)	Q - The solicitation calls for developing online media plans and budgets.  It does not, however, specifically call for media placement and buying services, which would normally be part of such a service.  Is this am implicit part of the scope of work that should be addressed in the proposal?
	A - Yes, media placement and buying services are implicit in the scope of work.

3)	Q - The solicitation stipulates that for evaluation purposes, technical merit and price factors will be weighted equally.  However, Modification 001 stipulates that prior experience will count for 20% of the total evaluation weight.  Which is correct?  Could you please clarify?
	A - Both are correct.   Technical merit, as set forth by the offeror's "technical proposal," will count for 50% of evaluation weight.  Price factors, as set forth by the offeror's "business proposal," will count for the remaining 50%.  Past performance, to be addressed in the offeror's "technical proposal," will be considered under the heading of "technical merit," and will count for 20% of total evaluation weight, or 40% of the technical merit weight.

4)	Q - How many copies of the proposal do you require?
	A - The Department would like a minimum of 3 copies of both the "technical proposal" and "business proposal."

<DESC>This amendment changes the submission date to COB 30 September 2003.   58 -The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is interested in receiving information from sources that feel they may be capable of providing off the shelf or near off the shelf capabilities that will support the MANPACK Technologies for the 21st Century, Advanced Concepts Technology Demonstration (ACTD) effort.  The information sought through this announcement will support USSOCOM and Marine Corps efforts to develop and package a toolbox of advanced capabilities, including an open, plug and play architecture that is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight and low power.   Today, most systems are developed independently and do not use open, plug and play architectures.  As a result, a total redesign is required when system upgrades are necessary.  Air, maritime, and larger land based systems have had advanced threat warning capabilities for many years but these systems are too large for use by individual soldiers. Technology is available today that will allow development and packaging of advanced threat warning capabilities using an open, plug and play architecture, which is user-configurable, small in size, lightweight, and require relatively little power. MANPACK capabilities must operate in diverse environments and deal with a multitude of potential threat information quickly and easily without burdening the operator.  These capabilities, since transmitting RF is not always practical, must also meet stringent size, weight and power requirements.  

Some of the toolbox technologies sought: 
Advanced signal detection; 
Sound detection and direction;
Sound canceling;
Biological/Chemical detectors; 
Body worn computers; 
Information display technologies including hand-held, wrist and head mounted displays;
Technologies for receipt, processing, control, and display of information from other platforms such as UAVs; 
Scaleable hardware (HW) bus structures (e.g. PCMCIA) that could be used in portable applications;
Language translation and exploitation;
Detection of enemy personnel, tanks, etc. via thermal, radar, etc.
Small belt worn quick scan energy detector (2MHz-10GHz objective);
Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR) incorporated into the Manpack for demonstration of National Threat Warning capability;
Programmable electronic attack and/or jamming of specific targets;
Battlefield mapping and/or awareness.
Data input and output devices (preference to permit mostly hands free operation). 

Expertise and Advice Sought:
SIGINT HW & SW architecture;
National/Tactical Integration

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses;
Technologies that provide a mobile soldier threat warning to dangers in soldiers area;
Mature technologies:
ready for purchase within 12 months or 
requiring minimal assistance to be ready in 12 months.
Technologies on commercial formats, (e.g. PC104, C-PCI, PCMCIA, etc) or can be easily integrated into a manpack system.

This announcement is NOT a Request for Purchase.  This is a Sources Sought and does not commit the Government to award a contract under the above listed terms, nor is the Government responsible to pay for samples or information received.  Innovative and/or revolutionary technical solutions are welcome.  Industry responses to this notice must contain the following information: (1) name and address, to include fax, email of firm and POC; (2) technical capabilities description.  Questions from industry should be directed to the attention Marc A. Duval at duvalm@socom.mil or by phone at (813)281-0560 ext 304. Responses (eg white papers, limited to 30 pages) should be sent electronically to the United States Special Operations Command, ATTN: Manpack_ACTD@socom.mil (10MB limit).  Please cc Mr. Marc Duval via email on all related documents submitted (eg. White papers) at duvalm@socom.mil.  A cutoff date of COB 30 September, 2003 is established for the submission of responses.

<DESC>The Department of State (DOS) has a continuing requirement to provide vehicle barriers to U. S. Diplomatic and Consular Missions overseas that have been certified to a specific level of anti-ram protection. Although the DOS has established a qualified manufacturers list (QML), DOS wants to continue to promote competition by increasing the number of qualified anti-ram vehicle barrier manufacturers. Hence, the following information is provided to interested manufacturers. Prior to DOS certification, vehicle barriers must be tested by an independent crash test facility to meet DOS standards. 
The standards and requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified are found in the following documents: Department of State (DOS) standard, SD-STD-02.01 (Revision A), Specification for Vehicle Crash Test of Perimeter Barriers and Gates and 12 FAH 5, Foreign Affairs Handbook. The specifications for these products are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of this qualification requirement. At a minimum, each manufacturer must have one vehicle barrier tested and certified by DOS prior to any award of contract. All requests for copies of these specifications and standards must be in writing and submitted to U.S. Department of State, DS/PSP/PSD, Attn: Dusty Rhodes, SA-14, Washington DC 20520-1403, with an information copy attached for A/OPE, Rm. 603, SA-6, Washington, DC 20522-0602.   Mr. Rhodes may be contacted at (703) 312-3144.

When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin.  The manufacturer is responsible for arranging, scheduling and paying for the tests conducted by an independent facility that has been approved by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Physical Security Programs, Physical Security Division (DS/PSP/PSD). The following test facilities have been approved for certification testing: Karco Engineering & Research Center, 9270 Holly Road, Adelanto, CA 92301, MGA Research Corporation, 5000 Warren Road, Burlington, WI 53105, (414) 763-2705, Texas Transportation Institute, 3135 TAMU, College Station, TX 77843-3135, (979) 845-6159, Transportation Research Center, Inc., St. Rt.33, Logan County, East Liberty, Ohio 43319-0367, (937) 666-2011, Veridian Engineering Division, 4455 Genessee St., Buffalo, NY 14225, phone (716) 632-7500, and Pennsylvania Transportation Institute, Pennsylvania State University, 201 Transportation Research Building, University Park, PA  16802,  (814) 865-1891.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to identify potential small businesses for the following requirements.  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is required, in accordance with HUD regulations, to annually assess each public housing agency's (PHA) performance under the Section Eight Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) and to assign annual SEMAP scores and performance ratings.  When a PHA has been assigned an overall rating of troubled, HUD Field Offices must conduct an on-site review of the PHA's Housing Choice Voucher program management in order to assess the magnitude and seriousness of the PHA's non-compliance with HUD regulations and/or SEMAP performance requirements.  HUD may require contractor services to conduct independent assessments of the PHA Housing Choice Voucher programs under SEMAP.  The scope of the assessments shall include the deficiencies cited in the most recent SEMAP scoring report, as well as specific deficiencies noted in Field conducted Management Reviews, Confirmatory Reviews, Independent Auditor Reports, and OIG Audit Reports that impact Section 8 program operations, activities, and administration.  HUD also requires technical assistance in order to assist the SEMAP troubled PHA in the development of a SEMAP Corrective Action Plan pursuant to 24 CFR, Part 985.107, implement appropriate on-site corrective action to resolve SEMAP and other related program deficiencies.  In addition, the Troubled PHA, and in some cases a near-troubled PHA, must develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for HUD review and approval and HUD must continue to monitor the PHA's progress to ensure the performance targets contained in the CAP are met and that the PHA will be able to attain a satisfactory SEMAP rating by the third SEMAP reporting cycle. Some or all of this work may be accomplished using contractors. A PHA's failure to correct identified SEMAP deficiencies or to prepare and implement a corrective action plan may be determined by HUD to constitute a default under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).	 In accomplishing these tasks, HUD field offices may utilize the services of contractors to conduct on-site reviews of PHAs that have been designated troubled, near-troubled or non-troubled but have significant management and operational deficiencies that result in systemic deficiencies, issues, or failures under the Housing Choice Voucher program.  The nature of the deficiencies may include, but not be limited to, an inability to properly manage and administer the PHA's waiting list, an applicant's income and eligibility for program participation, rent reasonableness of units, HQS inspections of units, and HQS enforcement.  Other deficiencies may include program accounting, project-based and special needs assistance, family self-sufficiency programs, and program marketing.  It is anticipated that these services will be solicited under NAICS Code 541990.  Interested firms that wish to be identified as potential sources for this requirement should provide a ONE page capability statement that provides a narrative description of the contractor's past experience and knowledge regarding the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), familiarity with the Section Eight Management Assessment Program (SEMAP), and any language or multiple language capability.  The capability statement must be all text (no pictures, no diagrams, etc.) and must be in a Microsoft Word document using Times New Roman 10 pt font.  Please include the most recent and current information available regarding your business. Please ensure that your one-page submission contains the following information: Name or Organization, Business Address (including website, if available), Point of Contact name, phone number, email address, and fax number.  You should also indicate the size classification of your firm: Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned (other than small business), HUBZone Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, or 8(a).  Also include whether you are on a GSA schedule and if so identify the schedule number. If you are on GSA Schedule please provide a copy of your GSA contract and negotiated rates. This can be submitted in an Adobe PDF file if necessary (although Microsoft Word is preferred). Please provide your notice of interest and brief description of your capabilities by Friday, September 5, 2003. All submissions must be received via email by this date.  No fax, mailed, or hand delivered submissions will be accepted.  You must submit your statements at the following address: lisa_d._bollinger@hud.gov

<SUBJECT>99 -- Partnering Opportunity for a closed-cell polyisocyanurate foam composition capable of high compressive strength
<DESC>Partnering Opportunity for a closed-cell polyisocyanurate foam composition capable of high compressive strength at temperatures of at least 190°C 

Sandia National Labs in Livermore, CA has developed TEPIC, a closed-cell polyisocyanurate foam composition capable of high compressive strength at temperatures of at least 190°C.  The new composition further exhibits only a modest loss in conventional mechanical properties.  The formulation of the present invention is based on the reaction product of an isocyanate and an epoxide resin catalyzed by a mixture of a tertiary amine and a cyclic amine.  Compressive strength is augmented by incorporating a large fraction of a non-reactive filler component into the precursor polymer gel.  Applications include rapid prototype tooling for composite lay-ups, hot embossing and injection molding. For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Alane Dulski at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87106-0115.  Fax: (505) 844-8011.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HIGH CAPABILITY INSTRUMENTS FOR PLANETARY EXPLORATION NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA-03-OSS-01-HCIPE)
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking University and Industry partners for the High Capability Instruments for Planetary Exploration (NRA-03-OSS-01-HCIPE) NASA Research Announcement (NRA).  The High Capability Instruments for Planetary Exploration  (HCIPE) Program supports the development of spacecraft-based instrument technologies that provide capabilities well beyond those of existing flight instruments.	The primary goal of this program is to promote the development of a new generation of scientific instruments for planetary exploration that can take advantage of the capabilities enabled by nuclear electric power and propulsion (NEPP).  These NEPP-enabled capabilities include:	     ·	      Electrical power ranging from 10-100 kW;	    ·	     Data rates ranging from 10 to 100 Megabits/sec for		     acquisition and transmission to Earth;       ·       Instrument mass up to 500 kg;	  ·	      Long observation times at targets;	    ·		   High delta V capability enabling multi-target		    rendezvous; and	 ·	        High duty cycles enabling extended		 instrument-operating times The Solar System Exploration Division (SSED) identified planetary science missions that are uniquely enabled by NEPP technologies under development by the Project Prometheus.  The first of these missions is the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO).  JIMO is an ambitious mission that will orbit three planet-sized moons of Jupiter - Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa - which may harbor vast oceans beneath their icy surfaces.	This mission would orbit each of these moons and perform extensive orbital investigations of their makeup, their history, and their potential for sustaining life.  JIMO-class follow on missions are also under consideration by NASA.  The goal of this program is to begin development of science instruments that could potentially be launched within a decade on the JIMO spacecraft.  The total anticipated budget for this technology research program is expected to be $5M and is expected to fund approximately 10-15 investigations. New measurement concepts may also be proposed to the HCIPE program.  In addition, modifications of existing instruments designed for previous low power space missions may also be proposed.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the HCIPE Program to develop proposals and begin development of science instruments that could potentially be launched within a decade. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide instrument(s) consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria identified above.  All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Rosemary R. Baize, Mail Stop 469, Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is September 3, 2003. Procurement questions should be directed to C. Tom Weih, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-3878, Carl.T.Weih@nasa.gov. The following LaRC technology proposal is seeking partnerships.  (1) Space Based Laser Mass Spectrometer Technical point of contact: Russell DeYoung, 757-864-1472, Russell.j.deyoung@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners in the development of a space based laser mass spectrometer. It is intended that the instrument will fly on future missions designed to analyze the surface of planets, asteroids, and comets. The instrument would emit a laser pulse with sufficient energy to create a plasma on the surface, with the resulting ejection of ions that would subsequently be captured and analyzed at the spacecraft. Potential partners must have a demonstrated history of space based instrument experience. Specific technologies of interest for partnerships are: 1)   Reflectron mass spectrometers that have the ability to quantitatively analyze elements from at least hydrogen to iron and their isotopes. 2)    Electrostatic lens with the capability to focus ions having an effective aperture of 2-meters or greater. 3)    Pulsed laser technology capable of producing pulse energies greater than 100 J/pulse at 1 Hz pulse repetition rate or greater.

<SUBJECT>A -- SINGLE-WIRE PROPORTIONAL COUNTER FOR X-RAY IMAGING
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE SINGLE WIRE X-RAY DETECTOR TECHNOLOGY


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license the technology to build a single wire x-ray detector.

LLNL has a new technology for building an x-ray detector.  This technology provides a detector which can image individual x-rays with a MHz count rate over a large area with high spatial resolution (x-y position) and high quantum efficiency.  The design also allows the device to measure the x-ray energy.  The device uses a simplified design compared to current technology, and this design results in a detector which is simple to build, operate, and maintain.

The new x-ray detector uses a novel implementation of the gas-proportional counter technology.  The detector uses two single wire grids to form an anode and a cathode.  An x-ray causes an electrical discharge in the fill gas to the anode.  The resultant electrical pulse travels to both ends of the wire.  Since an electrical pulse travels at approximately 1 foot per nanosecond, the device can use the difference in the time of arrival of the pulses to determine the position of the electrical discharge.  

The anode consists of wire wound side to side with a spacing of 1 mm.  The cathode plane is below the anode plane and uses a printed circuit board with a very fine single wire grid ( as fine as 50 micrometers) which is orthogonal to the anode grid.  This results in an x-y position measurement which is very fine in one dimension and coarser in the other dimension.  To determine the energy of the x-ray, the detector uses the sum of the two pulses coming from the single wire.  The resulting energy resolution is in the tens of percent.

The proportional counter x-ray detectors which are currently sold on the commercial market use delay lines, multiple ground planes, and multi-wire technology, which are expensive and technically complicated.  The new technology results in a much simpler design.  This design promises to have a higher degree of integral linearity and faster count rate than current proportional counter detectors.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's single wire x-ray detector should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000055-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's single-wire x-ray detector.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

RFQ.  CC-03-HQ-Q-0049 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2001-14(a).  This is not a set-aside procurement.  Any responsible vendor may submit a quote.

CONTRACT.  The contract resulting from this RFQ will be a firm fixed price contract for a period of performance beginning upon contract award through twelve (12) months.
 
CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (CLINS).  The contractor shall provide the required services as described in the Statement of Work.  The contractor shall submit a firm-fixed price for these services as Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001.  CLIN 0002 shall reflect the contractors hourly rate for consulting services.    

SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT.    Background:  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a non-appropriated federal financial regulatory bureau of the Dept. of Treasury with approx. 2900 employees in 90 cities nationwide.  OCC is headquartered in Wash., DC with current district office locations in NY, Atlanta, Chicago, KC, Dallas, and San Francisco.  OCC is currently restructuring its district office structure and closing the Atlanta, KC and San Francisco offices, and opening a new office in Denver, effective 09/2003.   Workforce Effectiveness (WFE) provides operational human resource and strategic human capital services for the OCC nationwide.  The role of WFE is evolving from an operational to a strategic focus, with emphasis on consulting and partnering with OCC management for strategic initiatives.  Staff is located primarily in the Washington, D.C. HQ office (approx. 52 staff members), with a small staff (approx. 18 total) in each of the district office locations.  The combination of shifting roles, closing offices, staff reductions and increased workload has created significant productivity issues among WFE staff members.  WFE seeks to increase productivity in the face of these challenges, and increase organizational performance in order to better serve OCC’s strategic needs.  Required Consulting Services:  The contractor will work to improve performance among WFE staff by enhancing the level of trust between and among staff members.  The approach must include a mechanism to benchmark and measure the current state of performance throughout WFE, using assessment instruments that are research-based and linked to a behavioral model of trust. These data will be used to identify needs and to track performance improvements in the department as a result of the intervention.   To maximize effectiveness, trust-building activities will be conducted with different teams.  One team will be composed of WFE leadership, the department directors, who are responsible for connecting the performance of their divisions to the department’s strategic outcomes.  There are a total of 6 individuals in this group.  Their leadership is essential to sustaining the connection between trust and organizational performance.   Two other teams of approximately 10-12 members will be formed of volunteers from across WFE division and geographical boundaries.   The leadership team will begin it’s trust building activities first, in order to serve as a model for the rest of the staff, and also to provide feedback and lessons learned for deployment with the other teams.  The second team will begin approxx 5 weeks after the first, and the third team approx. 5 weeks after that.  Trust building activities will take place both remotely and in person.  In order to reduce travel costs for staff located outside Washington, the majority of activities will occur employing web technology that mimics the functionality available in person.   In particular, the technology will provide for sharing knowledge-based content specific to trust in the workplace, discussion around that content, and facilitation by trained moderators who can respond to queries and link discussion together in meaningful ways.  The technology must also provide this functionality on both a synchronous and asynchronous basis, enabling staff flexibility on when to participate on the system.  The contractor will provide consulting services directly to each of the 3 teams, as well as working with OCC’s in-house moderators.  Consulting will take place in the form of training, face-to-face meetings, phone conversations, administration and interpretation of instrumentation, and moderation on the web-based trust-building platform.  The goals of consulting will be to:
·	Build shared understanding and heightened awareness of trust.
·	Develop skills, methods to practice the leadership/management behaviors and skills that build trust.

Quotes are being soli cited for the following item:  CLIN 0001-1 Each High Speed Variable Hydrostatic Drive Tow-Behind Runway Sweeper, Sweepster Model 2900, Brand Name or Equal.  The manufacturer of the brand name runway sweeper is Sweepster Inc., 2800 N. Zeeb Road, Dexter, MI 48130-9499.  All offerors proposing an equal item shall demonstrate that the proposed item meets or exceeds all of the following minimum salient characteristics of the brand name item being solicited.  This sweeper shall be a heavy duty, welded steel frame d, tricycle configured, pintle tow behind, variable speed, hydrostatic drive, diesel engine powered unit. It must sweep snow from runways at speeds up to 40 mph and be controlled remotely by an electric control panel, (with a 45-ft. electric cable) from th e cab of the tow vehicle. The control panel shall include the following functions; engine start/stop, engine throttle control, variable brush speed, brush and air blast and brush lift and swing, air blast on-off, air deflector up/down and work light on/off . The broom hydraulic functions shall be powered by a minimum of a 6-gpm hydraulic pump. The broom brushes shall be made up of convoluted polypropylene brushes, with a diameter of 36 inches and a width of 18 feet. The brush shall be hydrostatically driven at speeds variable from 5-500 RPM; the brush frame will have anti-shimmy, load carrying casters mounted behind the brushes for stability; broom shall be capable of independent movement from the tow frame by means of a spherical bearing hitch. The brush cor e shall be driven by a hydrostatic motor at each end and split into two equal halves for balance and to ease brush replacement. The brush shall be covered by a minimum of 14 gauge adjustable metal hood, equipped with a black polyethylene cover to prevent t he accumulation of snow on the brushes. The broom shall angle 45 degrees left or right and be equipped with an adjustable snow deflector attached to the front of the brush hood. The brush pattern shall be adjustable by means of a positive stop, bolt handle  type adjustment, accessible from the back of the sweeper head; electric limit switch type adjustment will not be acceptable.  The air blast unit mounted on the back of the broom shall be power by the same diesel engine and driven by an independent closed loop, hydrostatic system. The blower unit shall be sized at 10,000 CFM with a single inlet and dual directional outlet nozzles. The nozzle air speed of the blower unit shall be able to maintain 350 mph during heavy operations. The air blast nozzle ducts sh all be mounted one on each side of the sweeper unit and will automatically change angles when the brush angle is changed. This procedure allows one nozzle to di rect air to the leading edge of the broom and the other directing air towards the broom's trailing edge, thus dissipating snow windrows. High torque low speed hydraulic actuators shall be used to control baffle plates that control these nozzles; this elimi nates the use of cables and linkage rods.  This unit shall be powered by a minimum of a 300 horse power (at 2200 RPM) factory rated, liquid cooled, diesel engine, The engine, cooling system, hydraulics, batteries and charging system need to be enclosed in a vented metal shroud with hinged access panels, this will prevent snow and debris from collecting on these components as well as retaining engine heat while operating in the cold weather.  This sweeper will be operated in severe cold weather during winter  testing at a remote test facility, it must be a manufacturers standard commercial product and have a factory authorized dealer located within a 100 mile radius of the test site. Since this will be the only runway sweeper CRTC will have, it is of the utmos t importance that the one-year warranty included in the cost of the unit be quick and responsive. Even after warranty is up, parts, brushes and services must be readily available, since operation is mission essential.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-03-10710, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Proposal.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.   A firm, fixed-price, performance-based contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for Affymetrix GeneChip Processing services.  The period of performance will be from date of award through August 31, 2004 with two 12 month option periods.  The option periods will be exercised at the option of the Government.  The Contractor providing GeneChip Processing Services must utilize Affymetrix hardware, computer software, and GeneChips to accomplish the statement of work.  The Contractor shall process four types of samples of primarily human, mouse or rat origin: 1) total RNA, 2) cRNA probe, 3) fragmented cRNA probe, or 4) genomic DNA.  Samples shall be analyzed for either RNA gene expression, DNA genotyping, or DNA resequencing using Affymetrix GeneChip technology.  The Government will specify the Affymetrix  GeneChip to be utilized for each sample analysis.  The specified Affymetrix GeneChips must be available from the contractor at the option of the Government.  In some cases, GeneChips may be provided by the Government.  Specific Affymetrix GeneChips are detailed below and in the schedule of items.  As new GeneChips become available from Affymetrix, the contractor shall provide at the Government's request.  The Contractor shall be an approved Affymetrix service provider.  EPA will provide samples at a minimum of 2 samples and a maximum of 100 samples per batch.  Samples within a batch will be of similar type and processed in identical fashion.  Each batch of samples shall be processed and data submitted to EPA within 30 days of receipt of samples.   The Government will order a minimum of 322 samples and a maximum of  1000 samples during the base period.  The Government may extend the period of performance for two additional years and order a minimum of 100 samples and a maximum of 1000 samples for each option period.  Processing of each sample may include a range of options, as specified below and as line items in the attached schedule of items.  Thus any combination of service options may be ordered and applied to each sample.  These options will be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The Contractor shall provide Bioinformatics services, including an experimental design consultation (telephone call or face-to-face meeting) between appropriate EPA staff and Contractor staff, statistical comparisons for replicate experiments and multiple experimental groups, and a consultation between EPA staff and Contractor staff at the  finish of each batch of samples to discuss study design and outcomes.  Statistical comparisons will include, but not be limited to, using two-sided t-tests to compare the mean of the transformed signal values of all replicates, calculate fold change values as well as adjusted fold change values taking into account transcripts with low signal values not detected in all samples. For quality assurance purposes, the Contractor shall use the Affymetrix GeneChip (GCS) 3000 to ensure quality assurance with the data sets which will be produced by EPA using the GCS 3000.  The Contractor shall demonstrate the capability to generate quality data using the Rat 230A or B, Mouse 430 A or B, or Human U133 A or B arrays and the GCS 3000 scanner.   In addition, the Contractor shall provide optional quality control steps in  processing the RNA or DNA samples as required by the needs of a particular set of samples.  These steps will include test of fragmented probe using the Agilent BioAnalyzer, and test of probe using Affymetrix test chips.  The Contractor shall provide a summary and details of a quality assurance management plan for review and approval by the EPA QA manager prior to award.  This QA plan must include detailed standard operating procedures for the entire sample and data handling processes.  Clear progress and definite plans to achieve Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) compliance are required.  For sample security, the Contractor is required to maintain a minimum of two -80deg Celsius freezers for sample storage, attached to telephone emergency-notification systems (an industry standard).  For electronic data security,  the contractor must include the use of Government approved/audited (e.g., NIH, CDC) computer storage systems to safeguard confidential or proprietary data.  The Contractor shall provide per sample pricing for various steps in the analyses, with separate pricing listed for the various elements of services.  Performance will be closely coordinated with EPA staff throughout the process.  This coordination will be facilitated through quarterly face to face meetings between contractor staff, EPA Scientists and other EPA staff as appropriate, beginning upon award of the contract.  At these meetings, the following issues will be discussed: Affymetrix GeneChip processing services; Optional quality assurance tests of the fragmented cRNA probe using the Agilent BioAnalyzer and Affymetrix Test 3 chip;  Other quality control/quality assurance issues; Study  design and bioinformatics.  The Contractor shall have the capacity to handle up to 1000 individual RNA or DNA samples in the base period of performance, and provide optional service combinations for each sample as needed.  The Contractor shall provide for option year services and processing up to 1000 RNA or DNA samples per year.  The EPA will provide the samples as either 1) total RNA, 2) cRNA probe, 3) fragmented cRNA probe, or 4) genomic DNA, and specify the services required (some combination of items 1 to 17 above for each sample).  EPA may also provide the relevant GeneChips.  EPA Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) will coordinate work flow and performance throughout the process. The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 52.212-2,  Evaluation--Commercial Items.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R58-7MN1-03 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instruments Manufacturing, small business size standard is 500.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center requests the procurement of one Digital Microarray Scanner/DNA Chip Reader  “Name Brand or Equal” to a Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The scanner will be used in the genomics core facility of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center at Stuttgart, AR.  The instrument will complement existing equipment and facilities that support rice molecular biology and genomics research at the center where precision, accuracy, high throughput, and flexibility are essential.  Because a large number and diverse group of individuals will be using the system, it must be capable of managing data from different users separately and must be user-friendly.  Because this is a rapidly changing field of science, it is essential that we purchase an instrument that will be capable of utilizing and accommodating as many new technologies as possible when they become available.  An asterisk (*) next to the specifications of highest priority.  Minimum Specifications are as follows:  *-Ability to scan three or more user-selectable wavelengths (including those for Cy3 and Cy5 dyes) without changing hardware.  This will maximize usable data generated from each micro sample on the microarray chip, and minimize time needed to change instrument configuration.  *-Equipped with automatic focus adjustment for slides.  This will speed the sample scanning process and minimize operator-caused focusing problems.  -Scan area of 22 mm wide by 71 mm long or larger.  -Scan rate capable of 50 10 um scans per second or faster at full 22 mm width.  *-Resolution of 10 um pixelation or smaller.  *-Sensitivity of < 1 Cy3 molecule per um or better.  *-Capable of accepting and scanning samples present on a variety of substrates including standard microscope slides, and microcellulose and nylon mounted on slides, and commercial rice DNA chips such as those produced by Molecular Dynamics.  *-Capable of automatic sequential scanning.  This will help speed up and automate multiple dye scanning procedures.  *-Depth of focus:  30 microns or greater.  This will help maximize flexibility when reading slides of different thickness or of variable thickness across the slide.  -Excitation wavelengths at both 532 nm and 635 nm and capable of accepting additional lasers.  -Photomultiplier tube detector.  -Fluorescence Gain Adjusment Range of 70 dB or greater in increments of 1 dB or smaller.  *-Field uniformity: 10% variation or less over scan area.  *-All Computer hardware and appropriate genomics and statistical software (two or more licenses) to run analysis system, interact with existing LAN system, and analyze, manage, and store data.  *-Installation and user training.  *-Rapid and reliable local servicing.  The contractor shall perform all delivery and set-up and training so that the Digital Microarray Scanner/DNA Chip Reader is complete and ready to use.  The Digital Microarray Scanner/DNA Chip Reader shall be delivered to the USDA, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, 2890 Hwy 130 East, Stuttgart, Arkansas 72160.  The Government “REQUIRES” delivery no later than 45 days after receipt of order, however, each offeror shall include their proposed delivery schedule as part of their quotation.
