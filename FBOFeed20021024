<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS: DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and sub-system level technology for integration into the tactical environment that provide revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military, relative to current modes of operation.  The goal of the program is the identification of areas for potential improved performance, and the design of systems and sub-systems to validate performance gains.  The program focuses on the development of complete systems or subsystems rather than basic sciences.  Proposed systems and sub-systems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems.  Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases.  The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept.  Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward technology development.  AREAS OF INTEREST: DARPA-TTO focuses on aeronautic systems, space systems, and land systems and supporting technologies such as autonomous and semiautonomous operations, controls, communications, sensors, weapons, power, and propulsion.  The TTO emphasis for aeronautic and space systems is on high performance, affordability, autonomy, and adaptability. New platforms and other systems are needed with improved deployability, mobility, speed, range, lethality, survivability, and sustainability.  TTO especially seeks systems capable of new classes of missions and systems capable of robotic operation.  TTO is trying to meet the challenge of autonomy by increasing the ability to handle environmental complexity and mission complexity.  For examples of systems currently under development by TTO, see www.darpa.mil/tto/.  This BAA seeks new ideas, not necessarily extensions of the current programs.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2003 funds. The Government plans to make $3.0M of FY2003 funds available in total for all funded efforts, but the total of all awards may be less than or more than that amount.  The amount of funds, if any, for efforts or optional work after FY 2003 has not been decided. For Government programmatic flexibility, all offerors should segment their cost proposals as follows: an initial 12-month or shorter effort to explore and validate the concept followed by one or more optional efforts.  The total effort including options should not exceed four years. Successful initial efforts will increase the likelihood that TTO will make funds available after FY 2003.  OFFERORS: Teaming is encouraged. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in innovative tactical technology.  SCHEDULE: This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals.  The purpose of a white paper is for the offeror to solicit early feedback as to whether the research proposed will be of interest to TTO.  It is thus in the submitter's best interest to articulate clearly the innovative concept and the technology development proposed.  The submission of a white paper is optional, but should be used by the offeror to avoid the expense of proposal generation for ideas that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA.  TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within thirty (30) days after its receipt with a recommendation on the likelihood of selection. Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated.  TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award.  For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO at the address identified below not later than 1600 local time, 19 Dec., 2002.  In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO at the address identified below on or before 1600 local time, 20 Feb., 2003.  Proposals received after that date will be reviewed and evaluated in a timely fashion.  White papers received after 1600 local time, 28 Aug., 2003, will not be evaluated.  The BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 local time on 23 Oct., 2003. Proposals received after the closing date of this BAA will not be reviewed or evaluated.  As soon as the evaluation of a proposal is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected and the program will be funded, or 2) the proposal has not been selected. Non-selected proposals will be destroyed; however, one copy of non-selected proposals may be retained for file purposes.  EVALUATION CRITERIA: Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) Overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach.  2) Potential contribution and relevance to TTO mission by meeting the goals of the BAA.  3) Offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort.  4) Project and technology transfer plans. The plans to carry out the work and the plans to accomplish technology transition to use by the military services. 5) Cost realism.  FORMAT OF WHITE PAPERS AND PROPOSALS: The form and format for white papers and proposals follows.  White papers and proposals that do not satisfy these form and format requirements or with differing content between their electronic and paper versions may be rejected without further review or evaluation.  All submissions should be in the English language.  Electronic copies should be in Microsoft Word or PDF format and submitted via e-mail or on CD-ROM or Iomega Zip disk. Submission deadlines apply both to electronic and paper versions.  White Papers: White papers should describe the problem(s) that will be solved, any existing evidence that the proposed solution(s) will be successful, and the relative impact of such a solution(s), should it or they prove successful. White papers should contain the following parts: the Cover Sheet of Volume I of the offeror's planned proposal (see below); a summary, four pages maximum, of Volume I of the offeror's planned proposal (see below); and a one page summary of Volume II of the offeror's planned proposal (see below).

This procurement action is intended to be a five (5) year, multi-year contract, beginning FY03.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, this is a sole source procurement to ARMTEC Defense Products Co., 85-901 Avenue 53, Coachella, CA 92236.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command's (USASMDC's Missile Defense and Space Technology Center (MDSTC) Test and Evaluation Directorate has a requirement for continued Infrared Instrumentation System (IRIS) Mission Support, Operations, and Mainten ance (IMSOM) work until a competitive (small business set-aside) can be completed to provide a follow-on to the current contract. The competition is underway but is not expected to be completed and the effort fully transitioned to the new contract until 31 MAR03. During the period following depletion of remaining level-of-effort hours under the current IMSOM contract and prior to 31MAR03, several critical flight tests are scheduled that require IMSOM services to provide critical optical test data and interce pt verification data necessary to meet demonstration validation program requirements.  To bridge this gap, USASMDC plans, pursuant to 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, to award a contract modification to continue IMSOM effort under existing Contract  DASG60-95-C-0077 on a sole source basis with the incumbent IMSOM contractor, CACI/Automated Sciences Group (ASG), Inc., 1100 N. Glebe Road, Silver Spring, MD 22201. This effort continues the prior work of ASG, which developed the IRIS and which has operat ed and maintained the IRIS under various sole source and competitively awarded contracts since its inception.  The modification will add approximately 20,000 level-of-effort (LOE) hours and extend the period of performance of the contract by six months.  I t has been determined that award of these additional hours to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered by competition.  This action will provide the continued availability of highly s pecialized services relating to operation of the Infrared Instrumentation System (IRIS).  The IRIS sensor is installed on a contractor-leased and substantially modified Gulfstream IIb aircraft that conducts airborne optical measurements on targets of inter  est to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), USASMDC, Program Executive Office for Air and Missile Defense (PEO-AMD), and other government users. The IRIS is a unique, three-color, cryogenically cooled, imaging, infrared sensor system providing optical data c ollection coverage in a variety of infrared wavebands.  The objective of this effort is to provide technical analyses of mission test requirements with respect to IRIS measurement capabilities, mission planning support for mission conduct and range coordin ation, sensor and aircraft integration activities, IRIS operations and maintenance to support data collection, reduction and analysis of that data to provide infrared signatures along with an assessment of its impact to theater and strategic ballistic miss ile systems, and improvement and modernization of the IRIS and associated equipment.  These activities will be conducted at the contractor facility and/or CONUS/OCONUS test ranges.  A TOP SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding capability is re quired for this effort.

<SUBJECT>A -- AIRBORNE JOINT TACTICAL RADIO CLUSTER IV PROGRAM PHASE I REQUEST FOR INFOMATION (RFI)
<SOLNBR>DIGK-JTR-RFI
<RESPDATE>111202
<ARCHDATE>05122003
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer John Sorgini, 781-377-9317; Contract Specialist Patricia Forest 781-377-7512 or Major Ron Norton, Deputy Program Manager, JTRS Airborne Program Office, (ESC/DIGR) at 781-377-6110.
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for the Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Cluster IV program office.  The following information is provided for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. PURPOSE Headquarters, Electronic Systems Center, Global Grid Product Area Directorate, (ESC/DIG) JTRS Airborne Cluster IV Program Office (ESC/DIGR) at Hanscom AFB, MA is requesting information and feedback (programmatic, risks, schedule, etc.) from industry in advance of the Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD) phase of the Airborne JTRS Program.  The desired outcome from this RFI is to improve the quality of effort and resulting products related to the planned Pre-SDD solicitation. This RFI specifically seeks opinions, comments, and constructive advice from prospective prime contractors and their team members. INFORMATION REQUESTED: Prior to responding to the questions below, it is recommended that you visit the Hanscom HERBB Site (http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp, then click on 'Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System') and review the Draft SOO; Program Strategy briefing; Airborne Networking briefing; JTRS Network SOW; JTRS WNW SOW, and ORD. (1) Proposed Acquisition Strategy: a.  Given the current scope of the Airborne JTRS program, how would you develop an incremental/evolutionary approach to field an earlier interim operational capability that will meet the most urgent needs of warfighters? b.  What are the overall schedule drivers (Hardware, Software, Testing, Certifications, etc.) and how can the schedules be shortened?  How much schedule reduction do you envision to be possible? c.  How will you interface with platform integration contractors/aircraft maintainers to gain a greater understanding of platform constraints (specifically related to form factors, power, cooling, EMI, etc.) for Phase 1 efforts? d.  Please identify any "up-front" cost, schedule and risk drivers for the Airborne Network and JTRS Cluster 4 Radio design (including Logistics and Test and Evaluation considerations).  Are there any Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) tradeoffs related to these drivers that you would recommend we analyze in Phase 1? e.  What are the drivers for a 'family of modules' approach vs. separate radio variants? f.  Expanding upon e. above, can we accommodate multiple legacy form factors & platform interfaces with a single modular design or limited number of variants?  What are the key drivers for this assessment? g.  What Modeling & Simulation tools or processes do you recommend to analyze proposed solutions from Phase 1? Are any of these off-the-shelf? h.  What types of Government Furnished Information (GFI) will you require in Phase 1?  What types of agreements (i.e., Associate Contractor Agreements (ACA)) do you think you will need to facilitate the effort addressed in Phase 1? i.  How can we integrate the results of the Lincoln Laboratories efforts with Industry's efforts on Phase 1 and Phase 2? j.  What are the key technology or risk reduction areas that Government should address using its laboratory resources? (2) Airborne C4ISR Network Concept: a. Is the architecture for the envisioned Airborne C4ISR network concept realistic, and can it accommodate legacy Tactical Data Link transitions. Can the Airborne Cluster system architecture accommodate future evolutionary requirements growth? b.  What alternative approach(s) would you suggest and why? c.  What are the key architectural and/or technology trade-offs? d.  What are the critical issues in integrating the Airborne C4ISR network with the greater DoD enterprise? e.  What are the five most important architecture definition tasks/objectives for the Phase 1 effort? f.  What directly funded or internal research and development (IR&D) products, standards, and protocols are you aware of that would offer capabilities required by the JTRS Airborne C4ISR Network or for the Airborne JTRS design? g.  Identify and explain specific technology voids (networking RF, modem, etc) that will require funded R&D to provide the envisioned capabilities for a C4ISR network or to comply with ORD requirements for the Airborne JTRS. (3) Risk Areas and Mitigation Efforts: (specifically near-term mitigations) As part of our Pre-SDD acquisition preparation, the government has reviewed responses to ASC/RA's RFI for ISR Network F33657-02-R-5423 for applicability to this effort.  From those who submitted a response, this office is seeking any additional input that is specifically related to the JTRS Airborne Cluster Program.  From those contractors who did not submit a response to ASC/RA's RFI, our program is seeking input as to whether or not the risks identified below are properly focused and appropriate.  Please describe what other risks may impact the Airborne C4ISR Network implementation and/or the Airborne JTRS system development and production effort.  Also, describe any possible risk mitigation activities you suggest we pursue for each area. The risks identified below are not in any order of importance nor do we presume this to be a complete list: a. Routing - The platforms and associated networks participating in the Airborne C4ISR Network will be highly mobile, often connected by dynamic and potentially adaptive wireless links.  The changing nature of the network in terms of topology, bandwidth, and membership will present unique challenges to the network architecture. b.  Quality of Service (QoS)- The dynamic tactical operating environment, in combination with wireless data links that are bandwidth constrained, will most likely create contention for available bandwidth.  Providing and managing end-to-end quality of service to control latency, manage and allocate bandwidth to specific data flows, and provide reliable service in the tactical environment are also anticipated challenges, particularly when different QoS mechanisms are included in the end-to-end path. c.  Network Management - Providing the warfighter tools to maintain control and to monitor the health of the network at various levels is critical to Airborne C4ISR Network operation.  The network must have a robust management capability that will function in real-time with little operator intervention and that will "heal" and still manage to control the network even if it becomes segmented due to the loss or destruction of key links.  Coordinating the control of the network between sub-networks that are managed by different domains or that may be managed at different levels in the command and control hierarchy is an anticipated difficulty. At the application layer, the ability to manage and throttle data production must be available to ensure no application floods the network. At the network layer, the warfighter must be able to monitor and control connections and quality of service.  At the physical and link layer, the warfighter and the network must be able to obtain status on adaptive connections and set controls on operating parameters.  Accomplishing these functions in the very dynamic mobile network environment while maintaining QoS requirements will be challenging. d.  Integration/Interoperability - The JTRS Airborne C4ISR Network will operate as an integral part of the broader Global Information Grid.  The ability to operate with existing (DCGS infrastructure, SIPRNET, etc.) and planned networks (Future Combat System, Information Technology for the 21st Century) is a mandatory feature.  Integrating across the DoD enterprise including legacy capabilities, providing interoperability with current systems, and providing a path for growth compatible with evolving and new technologies will be challenging. e.  Security - The JTRS Airborne C4ISR Network must support data at multiple levels of security classification on the same network.  In addition, the network will create new security vulnerabilities that must be mitigated in the overall network architecture (e.g. traffic analysis, spoofing, denial of service).  Accomplishing this and complying with existing security policies are technical and management challenges. f.  RF Technology - The potential flexibility from a software based radio and the networking capabilities of the WNW won't be fully realized with current antennas and power amplifier approaches.  Identify and explain technology areas or architectural changes that should be explored (i.e., broadband, multiplexed, and adaptive techniques). g.  Platform Integration - The cost of integrating the Airborne JTRS into the multiple platforms will be the driving factor to the affordability of the system.  Successful integration will be highly dependent on the physical, functional, and electrical interfaces that are chosen.  What tasks/analysis would you recommend for Phase 1 to best generate the interface information we need for Phase 2? (4)  Please comment on any other items/areas you deem important to our strategy or architecture. Request to Review Draft SOO:  (This area is related to Draft Phase 1 SOO, dated 16 Oct 2002, Ref HERBB Site).  We offer these questions to help focus your SOO review.  Responses to SOO questions should be provided as part of your comments on the DRAFT SOO as a separate submission and not as part of your response to this RFI. a.  Do any of the objectives in the Draft Phase 1 SOO need to be modified to better enable you to provide Phase 1 recommendations and/or rationale without proprietary restrictions?  Please explain. b.  What tasks or objectives would you recommend adding or deleting from our draft SOO, if any, and why? c.  Is there anything in the Draft SOO that would prevent you from providing a firm fixed price offer for any or all of the Phase 1 effort? PROGRAM BACKGROUND: Program background information can be found in the Program Strategy Briefing and Draft SOO posted on the Hanscom HERBB Site (http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp, then click on 'Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System') HOW TO RESPOND: The Government would like to obtain preliminary answers to the above questions as part of the one-on-one sessions at the JTRS Airborne Cluster IV Industry Day 28 October 2002, with final responses no later than close of business November 12, 2002.  The intent of this request is to improve the Phase 1 SOO.  As such, we request that your response be non-proprietary.  If you feel that your data is proprietary, please clearly mark only the portions of your submittal that are deemed proprietary.  Your written responses should not exceed twenty-five (25) single sided pages. The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Government is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this RFI.  This invitation to respond to the JTRS Airborne RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid or request for proposal.

<CONTACT>Mark Ready, Buyer, Phone 405-739-4374, Fax 405-739-4452, Email Charles.Ready@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force has a requirement for Unscheduled Depot Level Maintenance (UDLM) and Structural Repair Kits in support of the C/KC-135 and B-52 weapon systems, and when necessary, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) aircraft.  UDLM requirements include, but are not limited to emergency repairs and other routine repairs, modifications, installations, or services, which are not otherwise available from other existing contracts, where original equipment manufacturer expertise is necessary or where lead time for a separate acquisition may not be feasible.  The UDLM contract may also be utilized when mission dictates that an aircraft must be returned to service within a minimally specified schedule period.  Structural repair kits would vary depending on aircraft needs and could include:  spars, ribs, longerons, other major structural components, fasteners (non-stock listed), wing body skins and unique stiffeners to major structural components.

This is a synopsis for a noncompetitive proposed contract action.  The proposed contract will be with The Boeing Company, Wichita, KS.  The reason for proposing a noncompetitive contract action is that Boeing is the only known source that comprehensively possesses the necessary data (including proprietary data), expertise, facilities and tooling, necessary to repair the weapon systems in the timeframes required.  This synopsis is issued for subcontracting opportunities and for the possibility of enabling future competition.  All interested parties may respond and all responsible offerors will be considered.  The proposed issue date for the solicitation is 14 Nov 02.  

The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using part 12.

Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The requirements of FAR 9.202(A) have been completed and copies of the qualification requirements and standards may be obtained as described in this solicitation. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering  agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements is cited in each individual solicitation. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.                                 ed.

<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order to Dowty Aerospace Corporation, Sterling, VA 20166-9321 for on-call engineering and technical services for a 12 month period to be used by the government for repair process development and product improvement evaluations on LCAC Propeller System Components and Assemblies. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: Provision of these services requires the use of proprietary Original Equipment Manufacturer's data and tooling that currently reside solely at the Dowty Aerospace Corporation. The propeller system was developed by the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, at company expense and provided to the U.S. Navy's LCAC program under a competitively awarded subcontract from the program's prime contract or, Textron Marine Systems. As the propeller system components are proprietary to the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, no other manufacturer has supplied these system components or design alteration data since this original contract. It is estimated that the cost of developing an alternate capability would greatly exceed the estimated value of the services needed.  Thus, the Dowty Aerospace Corporation is the only source that can cost-effectively supply the required services. Short notice specific tasking and expedited service delivery as completed will be required. Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.

The professional staff has, in particular, the expertise in functional and stereotactic neurosurgery for movement disorders which is vital to the success of this protocol.  Vanderbilt has been involved in the execution of this project from the very outset of its initiation and has successfully performed neurosurgical installation of intracranial devices and their connecting systems and pumps as well as experience in administering the experimental drug under the protocol.  Vanderbilt is considered the only source capable to continue and complete the remaining neurological implant requirements of the protocol.  To do otherwise, would jeopardize the continuity of the study as well as the safety of the patients.  A one-year contract, with up to two option years, utilizing up to nine patients during the three year period, beginning in April, 2003, is anticipated.  This organization, by virtue of their preliminary and current work under this protocol, is considered to be the only source that can reasonably provide the prerequisite knowledge, skilled personnel, surgical experience and expertise for performance of this proposed acquisition pursuant to 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The inherent duplication of cost and performance delays that would be incurred and associated with considering other sources are unacceptable to the Government.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  See Note 22

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a competition resulting in an award of an Independent Testing Contract [ITC] to perform Quarterly Release Test Management (QRTM) and regression testing on the Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) and the Common Working File (CWF).  Currently Medicare fiscal intermediaries (FIs) use the FISS as the primary component of Medicare bill processing function under Medicare Part A. FISS Part A Medicare claims processing includes inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, hospice care and other areas of institutional claims processing.  The purpose of the overall effort is to significantly improve the quality of standard systems software releases.  The effort requires various levels of traceability and methodical development and management of testing items such as standard systems business requirements, testing requirements, testing strategies, regression test cases, quarterly release test cases, test results and test metrics.  The scope of this testing effort includes the FISS and CWF systems that perform FI fee-for-service claims processing and the integrated fee-for-service claims processing software components that are integrated with the FISS systems.  These components include but are not limited to the various Pricers, Outpatient Code Editor (OCE), Medicare Code Editor (MCE), Grouper, and the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System [HIGLAS] payment component modules. All efforts shall be performed in accordance with CMS requirements and shall meet the objectives of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of QRTM and RT operations.  The regression testing program includes three areas of work: 1) business rules identification, 2) test-set development and maintenance, and 3) test preparations, executions, results analysis and reporting.  The contractor shall continue to maintain the existing regression testing schedules, products and processes to fully implement the comprehensive regression test program.  The contractor shall work with the incumbent contractor to assure a transition period through September 30, 2003 to ensure full continuity of the regression-testing program.  The Contractor shall maintain a detailed schedule for all regression testing related tasks in Microsoft Project.  The schedule shall include all activities and tasks from business rules related tasks to execution results reporting. To improve the software quality of the systems that support FI claims processing (e.g. FISS, CWF, Pricers, OCE, MCE, Grouper), CMS has implemented the QRTM initiative. The QRTM for the FI claims processing initiative consists of testing current quarterly release CRs through the integrated FISS and CWF Beta test sites'effort to emulate the production claim-processing environment.  The Beta test sites that support FI claims processing will execute integrated data exchanges simulating FI claims processing test cycles using the CMS supplied test-set and submit the results to CMS and the testing contractor.  The testing contractor shall assimilate the test results, develop test metrics, verify requirements traceability, and create metrics, test summary and risk assessment reports.  The Contractor will also require proficiency in the COTS products that are currently being used to support the CMS testing initiatives.  These COTS products include: The Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS), WinRunner, COMPAREX, TestDirector, and FileAid. These initiatives also require knowledge of COBOL as required to map copybooks to VSAM files to successfully perform file comparisons and data manipulations; proficiency in JCL to run jobs such as file comparisons and data selections; and proficiency in mainframe utilities such as TSO/ISPF and INFOMAN.  These initiatives require extensive, broad-based Medicare business and technical knowledge and skills. CMS intends to award a full and open competitive Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract for a one-year base, with four one-year option periods.  SETA Inc. is the incumbent contractor. The anticipated release of the RFP is on or about November 22, 2002 and will be available on FedBizOpps.  If you register with FedBizOpps, you will receive any subsequent RFP information.

<DESC>In the past, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has used four separate thermal-hydraulic codes (RELAP5, TRAC-P, TRAC-B, and RAMONA) to analyze plant transients and the loss-of-coolant accidents in the light water reactors.  The results were used to support licensing decisions.  For technical reasons and maintenance cost reduction, the NRC has consolidated these four codes into a single TRAC-M code that needs to be capable of analyzing a broad spectrum of accidents and transients to support licensing decisions.  The contractor shall provide technical assistance on a task order basis to perform experiments, collect data, and provide models to support the consolidated TRAC-M code.  The contractor shall provide the personnel, facilities, and equipment required to accomplish this objective.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be three (3) years.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available around November 8, 2002, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan.  Businesses, large and small, interested in teaming arrangements, should send their business information (i.e., organization name, address, contact name and phone number, and size of business) to the NRC Contract Specialist listed at the end of this notice.  The NRC will post this information in a Teaming Opportunities list with the solicitation.  In order to allow the Contract Specialist time to finalize the list to post it at the same time the solicitation is posted, the due date and time for receipt of business information is November 4, 2002 at 3:30 p.m.  All parties are put on notice that this limited source list is not representative of all sources which may have accessed the solicitation which is available on the FedBizOpps website.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Participants are being sought in an ever-changing program of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) called Distributor Partnership. We have issued three distributor partnership solicitations to date. Each solicitation has been slightly different in an attempt to improve upon the previous edition. 
The past Distributor Partnership solicitations were designed to take advantage of commercial off the shelf (COTS) items being held in stock to support commercial customers. Because the items were supposedly already stocked, the solicitations allowed only Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) to our customers based on a 3 or 10-day delivery period and limited the contract length to 18 months with firm fixed prices for the entire contract period. The initiative has had limited success to this point. What we've found is that the majority of our items don't lend themselves to 3 and 10-day delivery because the vendors don,t routinely stock the items.  The uncertainty of our demand patterns and the often times long lead times caused undue risk to the contract holder.
Many potential sources expressed an interest in expanding this concept to include the potential for shipments to government stock locations and allowing a longer contract period. We intend to formulate a new Distributor Partnership solicitation based upon responses from this survey.
Features we hope to incorporate into the new solicitation include filling stock orders for all National Stock Numbers (NSN) that cannot be delivered in a timely manner using DVD, expanding the contract term to up to 5 years, utilizing a best value evaluation instead of a "first in", "first out" method and only allowing for a single award per NSN. 
In order to reduce waste and make this effort as productive as possible, a modified approach will be used to determine the actual format of the solicitation(s) to be issued and to identify the candidate list of NSNs. 

The anticipated process will follow these steps:
1.	Simultaneously issue this letter to known interested sources and issue a Sources Sought notice in the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fedbizopps.gov) to explain this initiative.
2.      Obtain a list of candidate items NSNs from potential sources. (The initial list of potential candidate items is due by NOVEMBER 29, 2002.) Candidate items must have an NSN assigned and be managed by S9E. (Potential sources will be asked to provide a list of NSNs for validation via e-mail or a 3.5 floppy disk. MS Excel is the preferred format for the list.) 
3.	The candidate items will then be reviewed by DSCC to validate that the NSN is managed by S9E, is not currently on a long-term contract, and is coded as a stocked item in our system. The verified list, along with current demand data will be returned to the source that submitted the candidate item for validation.
4.	The potential source will be asked to use the validated list to answer a market survey and resubmit the information in an electronic format (MS Excel is the preferred spreadsheet format).
5.	A review of all responses will be completed to determine the actual list of NSNs to be included in the pending solicitation(s). (The intent is to solicit on a competitive basis as many of the validated candidate items as possible.)

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division  (NOTSD) requires development, fabrication, testing and logistics support for the Virginia Class Submarine (VSSN) Emergency Diesel Generator Control Panel (DGCP) Front Panel Simulator (FPS).   The successfully tested and completed trainer shall be delivered to NAVSUBSCOL, New London, CT.  The primary use of this trainer will be to teach operation, casualty and degraded modes, maintenance, engine troubleshooting and fault isolation skills.  The diesel engine generator set simulation software will be used to simulate a diesel operational engine (Caterpillar 3512B).  The student station will receive simulated inputs as if a real engine were connected.  The student station configuration will include the diesel generator control panel, the diesel local control panel, the laptop computer system and a two-dimensional photo engraved engine generator mockup.  The DLCP will have the physical appearance of the tactical DLCP and will simulate or stimulate the operations of the tactical DLCP.  Attached to the top of the DLCP will be the engine vision interface module.  This module will link data to the DGCP.  Other modules linking to the DLCP are the electronic control modules, the versatile control module and the integrated temperature sensor module.  The DLCP will provide necessary data to the laptop computer system.  This data will enable correct diagnostic processing with the CAT Electronic Technician (ET) Tool.  The interface between the Caterpillar ET Tool and the DLCP is proprietary and the government does not own the documentation to support it.  There will be no government furnished equipment or government furnished information in the production of this system.  Interested companies should respond with the following information:  1) Past performance on government contracts of like or similar nature;  2) Whether your company intends to bid as a prime or subcontractor; 3) Size and status (based on the related small business size standard of 750 employees).  4)  Describe ability to develop the logistics elements required to support this trainer. These elements include configuration management, provisioning, and operation and maintenance documentation.This announcement is for market research purposes only. The Government does not intend to pay for information received. Submissions should be made in writing or via e-mail only.

<SUBJECT>Disposition of Excess Nickel
<DESC>This is a Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) from qualified companies who can  transport, process and recycle approximately 15,700 tons of nickel scrap recovered from uranium enrichment process equipment into products suitable for use in support of government and commercial nuclear industry applications. Current inventories of nickel scrap consists of approximately 9,700 tons of nickel ingots stored at the DOE uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky, and approximately 3,600 tons of shredded nickel scrap stored at the DOE uranium enrichment facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  On-going demolition activities at the Oak Ridge facility will create an additional 2,400 tons of shredded nickel scrap. The scope of this EOI does not include an additional 21,000 tons of shredded nickel scrap that could become available from the future demolition of the shut down Oak Ridge and Portsmouth, Ohio, facilities and the operating Paducah facility. All of the nickel scrap is contaminated with uranium and trace quantities of technetium, neptunium, and plutonium.  DOE Policy limits the recycle of this metal for use in products to support government and commercial nuclear industry applications.  In addition, all of the shredded nickel scrap is considered classified confidential-restricted data. Qualified companies must possess current authorizations, licenses, personnel, and off-site facilities to accept, transport, store, process, and disposition classified, export controlled, and radioactively contaminated equipment and materials. In addition, firms must undergo a Foreign Ownership Control and Influence (FOCI) review in order to acquire personnel clearances necessary to work with the classified nickel scrap.  Custodial responsibility for the material will pass to the contractor upon removal of the material from the DOE site.  Title to the classified material will pass to the contractor upon elimination of all classification concerns. DOE is particularly interested in concepts that would result in beneficial impacts to local communities at Paducah, Portsmouth and Oak Ridge, in support of DOE efforts to diversify local economies. ? A prospective contractor?s meeting will be scheduled in early December for companies who have replied to this expression of interest. This meeting will include a short classified discussion open only to participants with a DOE ?L? or ?Q? clearance.  Companies that wish to attend the presentation must provide the following information for up to three (3) representatives: ?  Name ? social security number ? company name ? citizenship ? any DOE clearance (level, facility) DOE intends to compete this work among those firms who have Materials Disposition Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) with the DOE.  Other companies interested in this work will be provided the opportunity to qualify for award of a basic ordering agreement.  The period of performance for this work will be one (1) year after receipt of the nickel scrap.  No DOE funding is planned for the resulting contract. Instead, it is anticipated that the cost of processing will be offset by the value of material used for authorized uses. For detailed information on the Materials Disposition Basic Ordering Agreement and the request for proposal (RFP) visit our website at http://www.oro.doe.gov/Procurement/OR22911/mainpage.htm  a new RFP for the BOA will be issued in November 2002.
