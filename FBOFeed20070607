<RESPDATE>061107
<ARCHDATE>06062008
<CONTACT>ANN CAPRON CONTRACTING OFFICER 3034452429     acapron@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award on a sole source basis with Excel Geophysical Services, Inc., Greenwood Village CO. They possess unique proprietary software necessary to successfully process the seismic reflection data to Reclamation specifications and requirements. Software unique to Excel Geophysical processing sequences include OPTIM's SeisOpt 2D velocity optimization software and consulting services, necessary to remove extreme topographic and lateral and vertical-velocity artifacts from the seismic reflection data, BP ARCO AVO workbench, which is necessary to interactively improve velocity estimates to improve reflection imaging, particularly in the complex structure associated with folded and faulted sedimentary rocks, the Cascade 2D-3D prestack time migration package developed exclusively for Excel Geophysical necessary to successfully image faults that are the target of Reclamation's investigations, and Data Modeling's Auto Imager necessary to provide high-resolution imaging of subsurface faults. Only Excel Geophysical possesses this unique combination of seismic reflection processing capabilities necessary to successfully execute processing of Reclamation's seismic reflection data.  The vendor shall be located in the Denver CO area for actual, physical visits at their office by Government employees. WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CONTRACTOR. The seismic reflection processing sequence involves many steps that can be broken into a modest number of overall tasks. The proprietary seismic reflection data consist of two 2-D lines.  The total amount of resulting 2-D seismic reflection data will consist of ~46 line miles of 48-fold, 96- channel data. The data to be processed is located in Emery CO., UT.  Task 1: Preprocessing. Read the SEGY data and geometry files from each 2D line. Input information from the observers notes and edit data as necessary. Establish line geometries in ProMAX and import the data into ProMAX.  Task 2: Pick first arrivals. Perform velocity optimization to achieve a globally optimized velocity model using only first arrival travel time data and 2D line geometries as input using Excel proprietary software best-suited for this area, which is characterized by strong lateral velocity gradients, and in areas with extreme topography or complex near-surface structure.  Task 3: Perform wave-equation datuming using the velocity models derived in Task 2. Perform surface-consistent residual statics calculations. Task 4: Estimate velocities down to basement located at two-way travel times (TWTT) of 4-5 s using Excel proprietary software or software such as BP ARCO AVO workbench, to interactively improve velocity estimates to improve reflection imaging, particularly in the complex structure associated with the folded and faulted sedimentary rocks in these two seismic reflection lines. Task 5: Kirchhoff pre-stack time migration. Perform common-offset Kirchhoff pre-stack time migration for both lines after common-offset binning and common-offset f-x deconvolution. Produce time stack sections for both 2-D lines. Task 6: Convert time stacks to depth sections using velocity fields reviewed and modified by Reclamation. Task 7: Provide Reclamation with DVDROMs containing SEGY outputs of Tasks 5 and 6 and  ProMAX 7 line/area archives for both lines, including all processing flows, parameters, and associated data. Provide Reclamation with paper hardcopy reproductions of brute stacks, pre-stack-time-migrations, and depth sections for both lines. Deliverables from 8/1/07 through 8/30/07.  Digital deliverables in the form of computer files via email, floppy disk, CD-ROM, or DVD-ROM.

<SUBJECT>A--Conservation Planning of Kiska Island WWII Guns
<SOLNBR>701817Q021B
<RESPDATE>061107
<ARCHDATE>06062008
<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and agency with the United States Department of the Interior, is soliciting proposals to provide professional services to produce a conservation plan (plan) for WWII historic guns located on Kiska and Little Kiska Island (Kiska Island), within the Aleutian island chain of Alaska. These guns and placements are part of a National Historic Landmark, though much information about them is not known. BACKGROUND: Many smaller islands such as Kiska and Little Kiska within the Aleutian island chain of Alaska  were the main fortified American line of defense against a Japanese invasion of North America during World War II.  To help guard the country against further invasion and impede further Japanese attack and invasion, American troops hauled and secured massive artillery guns onto cliffs and rocky coastal buttresses throughout the Aleutians. These islands were occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army in June 1942 and held for a little over a year, until about July 1943.  During that time, the Japanese also fortified the island with, among other things, a number of anti-aircraft and shore defense guns and gun placements.  For the year that the Japanese held both Kiska and Attu islands during World War II, they too fortified the coast with a battery of large guns, and at the end of the war, many of the guns on Kiska Island were abandoned in place.  Today, erosion and vandalism put their conservation and protection at great risk.  These remaining guns are the only artifacts of their kind available to the Government and represent an integral tool to understanding and interpreting the material culture of World War II in the Aleutians for future generations.  In 1985 the islands and the largely intact battlefield were designated the Japanese Occupation Site, Kiska Island National Historic Landmark.  The Landmark is administered as part of the Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge by the FWS, while the National Park Service (NPS) has advisory and oversight responsibilities over National Historic Landmarks.  Although the Japanese Occupation Site has been a National Historic Landmark for over 20 years, specific information on the resources present and their conditions is almost totally transparent.  In response to rumors of theft and vandalism of the guns located on Kiska and Little Kiska Islands, the Government intends on contracting for an inventory and evaluation, and the development of a conservation plan for their preservation. OVERVIEW: This Scope of Work shall detail work necessary to collect the information and prepare a Conservation Plan for the World War II guns on Kiska and Little Kiska Islands within the Japanese Occupation Site National Historic Landmark and has the following objectives: "	Provide the Government with a functional conservation plan to ensure the long term preservation of history and knowledge of the existing guns and placements "	Explore artifact conservation methods including the removal of key "at risk" guns to prevent further deterioration and to ensure visitor education and interpretation of these National Historic Landmark resources.  "	Recommend conservation methods that will conserve the physical characteristics of the guns in place. This procurement is being considered s a commercial item and a combination of soliciation procedures are being utilized for this procurement in accordance with FAR Part 12.203 and include FAR Part 13, and FAR Part 15. The closing date of this solicitation is June 11, 2007 at 2:00pm. Interested parties should contact the contacting officer referenced in this announcement prior to the closing date.  Award shall be amde within 10 days following the posting of this solicitation notice.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to MTS Systems Corporation (MTS) to procure a Multi-Channel, Multi-Station FlexTest GT Digital Controller and a Model 293.11 Hydraulic Service Manifold for the Turner Fairbank Research Center.  The controller and hydraulic service manifolds will be operating with the FHWA, Research Center existing actuator (load-jacks) and high-pressure hydraulic pumps.  It is essential that the new equipment and existing systems work properly together.  By maintaining compatibility between the new and existing MTS equipment, FHWA can create test systems ranging in complexity form a single actuator applying a static load to multi-actuator rigs with time-history programmed loads plus a number of tests running at the same time.  Only by continuing to use MTS control and hydraulic manifold that work with the existing MTS equipment will operation be possible and efficiently maintained.  There is no other control system or hydraulic service manifolds of this type available which are compatible and interchangeable with the FHWA existing MTS equipment.  Therefore, MTS is the only known vendor that can provide the required equipment.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about June 21, 2007.

Period of Performance is 365 days. The overall  estimated price range is between $ 1M and $ 5M. The solicitation is an  unrestricted acquisition, full-and-open competition. In accordance with  DFARS 252.204-704 “Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR),”  Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be  accomplished at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesn’t currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to award a new contract to link and package 30mm PGU-15/B Target Practice (TP) ammunition currently held as Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) 30mm PGU-15/B TP assets.  MARCORSYSCOM will issue a competitive solicitation limited to Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS), resulting in a fixed price contract award.  The PGU-15/B TP cartridge is used on the MK-44, 30mm Gun System that is currently on the EFV.  The Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (PM AAA) owns PGU-15/B cartridges, but they are in the Air Force’s configuration (NSN 1305-01-093-3338) and are unlinked.  PM AAA has a requirement to reconfigure 222,000 of these rounds for use in the EFV’s Gun System.  The contractor will be required to procure MK-15 ammunition links, M592 metal cans, foam inserts and associated packaging material required to package this ammunition in accordance with Automated Data Li!  st (ADL) 53711-7624864, required for Navy and Marine Corps 30mm ammunition.  Government owned ammunition, currently packaged in a configuration useable only for A-10 aircraft, will be provided to the manufacturer as Government Furnished Material (GFM).  The contractor will be required to de-tube the ammunition (as it comes in the Air Forces A-10 packaging configuration), inspect the ammunition to ensure serviceability, and then place the ammunition into MK-15 links.  The linked ammunition will then be placed in the foam protective cushioning and then into a M592 metal can (two 15-round belts will be placed into each can).  The 30-round packed configuration will be palletized in accordance with ADL 53711-7624864.  The contractor will be authorized to use the standard 40 x 48 wooden pallet rather than the MK3 metal pallet to reduce the cost of this project.  The contractor will be required to procure an additional 10,000 MK-15 links and ship them to NSWC Crane, IN.  The appli!  cable National Stock Number (NSN) for the reconfigured ammunition to b e delivered is 1305-01-525-8642, Ctg, 30mm PGU-15/B Linked, DODIC AA94.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) intend to award a sole-source contract to Brace Management Group Inc., a small disadvantaged business located in Largo, Maryland.  The intent is to purchase software licenses, that will allow SPAWAR and ONR financial personnel and support contractors immediate use of a web- based software database,  known as the "Official Undistributed Disbursement (OUD) Manager," developed by Brace Management Group, Inc.  The application provides a tool for the reconciliation of disbursements and collections registered through Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) and the corresponding financial records in the Standard Accounting and Reporting System, Headquarters Module (STARS-HCM) and Financial Departmental Reporting/Major Command Reporting (FDR/MCR). The tool compares predefined data elements and aids in making a determination as to the discrepancies.  The database is updated regularly by Brace to provide SPAWAR and ONR the latest data from DCAS, STARS-HCM, and FDR/MCR.  As a result, SPAWAR and ONR will be able to identify variances using an automated means, thereby eliminating the cumbersome manual comparison process.  The database application is hosted on Brace computers and accessible via the web. The proposed contract is a follow-on to a sole source contract N00039-05-M- 0044, under which Brace provided SPAWAR with license to use the beta version of OUD Manager. The follow-on contract will purchase licenses that permit SPAWAR to continue use of Brace's OUD Manager to compare disbursements and collections registered in U.S. Treasury and the corresponding financial records in STARS-HCM and FDR/MCR, and additionally allow ONR to use the OUD Manager tool as well.  This fixed-price contract action will have a start-up twelve-month base period starting 01 August 2007 with four one-year options. This request is considered to be sole source to Brace Management Group Inc., and no solicitation will result from this announcement.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>F--Long Term Wild Horse Holding Facility West of the Mississippi - 1,000 to 2,500 Head
<SOLNBR>NAR070106
<RESPDATE>090507
<ARCHDATE>06062008
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 1,000 to 2,500 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located west of the Mississippi River. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Wild Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.   The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain one or more facilities (located west of the Mississippi River), each to pasture 1,000 to 2,500 wild horses. The intent is to provide a pasture setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.  During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses may be younger, adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. On December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act (Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This may require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment.  Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 1,000 to 2,500 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located west of the Mississippi.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor. Objective The objectives of this contract are: To maintain the excess wild horses in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable or adoptable animals.    To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. General Services The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks.  Specific requirements for each are set forth in the subsequent paragraphs of the Description/Specifications/Work Statement. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain 1,000 to 2,500 (Based on the offeror's proposal) wild horses grazing in pastures.  The pastures shall contain sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures and shall not be included in carrying capacity determinations. Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis. Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility. Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition. Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment.  Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate and draw blood samples for horses prior to shipment.  Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses. The results of the each inventory will be included in the monthly invoice.  Maintain a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of these observations. Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc. Each death will be recorded by the freeze mark and or description of the animal,  date the animal was noted as dead and then submitted on each months invoice.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI. Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR and/or PI or a designated representative, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain. Specific Services Handling and Gathering In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups. All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling. Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices. Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather. The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained separate in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment. Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facilities to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment.  The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals.  The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped.  Corral / holding Facility Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels). It is anticipated that the corrals will be used to receive, hold, gather, ship and prepare horses.  The corrals must be at least 72" high and made of stoutly constructed material i.e. pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  No barbed wire will be allowed in the construction of corrals and any corral constructed of mesh wire (openings no larger than 2 by 4 inches) must be equipped with at least 3 wood sight boards (2 by 8 inches) located on the upper portion of the fence.  The three sight boards shall be spaced no more than 12 inches apart.  Corrals constructed of pipe or wood must have openings of not more than 12 inches between horizontal members.  Corrals and holding areas need to be free of protrusions, and hazards.  Corral gates shall be constructed of wood or pipe the same height as the fences.  Gates shall be visible to the horses either from the materials used in construction or by using materials such as plywood or plastic mesh placed on the gates.  The contractor will furnish a concrete pad and electricity for a hydraulic chute and the Bureau will furnish the hydraulic squeeze chute.  Two sorting corrals, each with a minimum of 2,500 square feet. Separate corrals at the facility shall be available for confining lame or sick animals needing special care.  Soil types in corrals/pens must be well drained and non-alkaline in nature.  Slopes within the pens shall provide for adequate drainage.  In addition to other corrals the facility must have two larger corrals each with a minimum of 5,000 square feet to be used as holding corrals.   Small pastures to maintain approximately 150 wild horses prior to shipment will be necessary. These pastures need to be accessible to the working corral, and constructed to have fencing to hold foals if needed during the weaning process. Fencing must be constructed of small wire mesh, low to the ground to prevent a foal from going under the fencing.   The small pastures, described under (5) above, must have sufficient water for 150 wild horses at a rate of 16 gallons per animal, per day. Adequate chutes, crowding alleys, to facilitate gathering, preparing, and shipping animals. The runway must have solid sides, have at least three sliding gates, be solidly constructed of steel or lumber, be at least 36' in length, 28-32" wide, and at least 72"tall. Unloading and Working Facility The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  The chute may either be permanent or temporary.  In order to load horses at the site, a crowding pen and runway at least 36 feet long and 28 inches to 32 inches wide, with at least three slide gates will be required.  Fences shall be a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel. Chutes shall have solid sides which restrict the animal's vision and will minimize the risk that animals may attempt to jump out of the chute.  Width of the chute must be at least 32 inches.  A catwalk is required for at least one side of the chute and the runway.  Fences shall be at a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel. Fences Pasture perimeter fences shall be a minimum of 52" in height.  Pasture division fences shall be a minimum of 48" in height.  All pasture fences shall consist of four strands of barbed wire or other acceptable fencing materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, it may be necessary for the contractor to flag certain fences with eight (8) inches of flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence every 20 feet to make the fences more visible to the horses. Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures.  Pastures The facility shall have sufficient land and forage to sustain a 1,000 to 2,500 (depending on the offeror's proposal) wild horses year round. The land must be privately owned by the offeror or the offeror must have long term control of the offered lands.  Offered lands cannot include public lands, herd areas, Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory and/or herd management areas.  If any public lands, herd areas, Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory and/or herd management areas are within the privately owned or controlled land, the public lands must be fenced out and will not be used in the calculation of the stocking rate.  The private lands must be at least 10 miles from any BLM Herd Management Area, Herd Area and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  It is the responsibility of the offeror for verifying that offered lands meet this requirement. Information on the location of BLM Herd Management Areas, Herd Areas and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory can be obtained by the Forest Service office or for BLM land the BLM local office or the Wild Horse and Burro web site (www.wildhorseandburro.blm.gov.)Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.  Pastures shall be free of hazards such as unfenced paved public highways.  If pastures are noncontiguous, they shall be managed as separate units, each with a corral facility, with the maximum number of units being four (4).  Horses shall not be moved from one unit to another except under extraordinary conditions and with the permission of the COR and/or PI.  The maximum allowable driving distance between all units combined shall be no greater than fifty (50) miles. Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality or removal, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable. The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition yearlong, with supplemental feeding as described in paragraph f, below.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body.   The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above. Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures. Vegetation monitoring will be done by qualified personnel.  If vegetation utilization exceeds the moderate level, changes may need to be made so land health standards are maintained. Supplemental Feed Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses when natural forage nutritional value is low.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, and mold.  Feed will be required daily for animals maintained in the corral areas, and supplemental feed will be required for pastured animals only during times when natural forage will not maintain the animals in good condition.  For example this could be during the winter months when the forage nutritional value is low. Horses maintained in corrals shall be fed hay in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.   Hay used shall have a protein content of 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, and free of dust, mold and weeds or grasses deemed unhealthy forage for wild horses.  Feed shall be provided to the animals in cribs of appropriate size for the number of animals in the pen.  Feed Requirements A good quality grass, grass/legume mix or legume hay shall be fed to and made available in sufficient quantity for each animal, with a crude protein not less than 12 percent.  Animals shall be fed at least 2.5 percent of body weight per day.  The COR may test hay to verify quality.  Inclement weather will stress animals, requiring that the volume of feed be increased to maintain their body flesh. Water, Minerals, and Salt Each pasture shall have reliable water sources capable of supplying 16 gallons of clean water per horse, per day.  The maximum distance to water in any pasture shall be 4 miles. Granulated, rock, or block salt shall be accessible to all horses in each pasture. Minerals necessary to maintain the horses in good condition and that are deficient in the available forage in the care unit shall be provided to all horses in each pasture, either as a supplement or added to the salt. Deaths and Disposal of Remains Dead horses shall be identified by freeze number and physical description, and disposed of in accordance with State and/or local sanitation laws.  Rendering plants may be used for carcass disposal provided no compensation is received by any agency or individual disposing of the remains.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI, or designated representative immediately if the death of a horse is suspicious and it appears that a postmortem examination should be performed by a veterinarian.  The COR and/or PI shall hire a veterinarian and make the arrangements for this procedure. Observation of Horses The wild horses shall be observed by the contractor at a minimum of one (1) time per week, to determine the overall condition of the animals, and any deaths.  Observation will be conducted  more frequently when conditions warrant, i.e., during flooding, tornados, and the fire seasons, to ascertain their safety and well being and assure that fences are properly maintained.  Except in emergency situations, observations shall be carried out on foot, from a vehicle, or horseback.  In unusual situations, such as deep snow, etc., which make ground transportation impractical, aircraft may be used, with the prior approval of the COR and/or PI.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses. Records that document, as a minimum, the date of the observation, number and condition of the horses, problems and concerns of the observer, and the name(s) of individual(s) making the observation shall be maintained.  Any problems or concerns shall be reported to the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of discovery. Access to the Facility Access to the unloading and loading chute shall accommodate both sedans with trailers and semi- trucks. Access shall be available during inclement weather. Observation for the Public The site is not intended to be a public viewing area.  Therefore, the contractor will restrict or prohibit access onto the site by the general public. The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of any request from humane organizations, general public, media or wild horse interest groups, to observe the horses.  All such organizations and groups may be allowed to tour the site only under the approval and guidance of the COR and/or PI. All requests to view the animals shall be directed to the COR and/or PI. Records  An inventory that identifies all horses delivered to the site shall be kept at the facility.  A record shall be kept on the location (pasture) each horse occupies.  Each horse may be identified with a 4 digit freeze number on the hip, along with an angle freeze mark on the left side of the neck.  Horses that die shall be identified as soon as possible and noted on the monthly inventory.  Probable cause of death shall also be noted. Upon request by the COR and/or PI, the record shall be made available within 5 days for duplicating. Responsibilities of BLM Veterinary Care The BLM will provide and pay for a veterinarian to treat sick or injured horses, as deemed necessary by the COR and/or PI.  The veterinarian may be used to perform euthanasia on horses and conduct postmortem examinations as requested by the COR and/or PI.  The contractor shall gather and hold such animals and assist the veterinarian if necessary.  All vaccinations and preparation for shipment of horses will be conducted by the BLM with assistance from  the contractor. Farrier Services The COR and/or PI will determine if horses should have their feet trimmed.  BLM will make the arrangements and hire a farrier if trimming is needed.  The contractor shall gather the horses needing trimming and assist the farrier. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR070106, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about June 21, 2007. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is to analyze Colorado River cutthroat trout and greenback cutthroat trout populations using microsatellite or AFLP DNA.  Three specific questions need to be answered for each population:  (1)  is the population primarily Colorado River cutthroat trout or greenback cutthroat trout?  (2)  What is the percent purity for each population? This should be determined by identifying the degree of introgression with other cutthroat subspecies (greenback, Colorado River, Yellowstone) and rainbow trout.  (3)  What is the genetic diversity of the Colorado River cutthoat trout or greenback cutthroat trout populations that are considered pure. These questions should be answered using scientifically valid methods that allow determination of estimates with 95% confidence.  A minimum of 20-30 fin samples or previously extractd DNA samples will be provided for each population analyzed.  Up to 50 populations may be analyzed depending upon the bids received.  A final report including each site, cutthroat subspecies present, percent purity, percent hybridization from other cutthroat subspecies and/or rainbow trout, genetic diversity and statistical confidence for each result should be included.   Proof of previous experience or demonstrated ability to separate between Colorado River cutthroat trout and greenback cutthroat trout is required.  The final report is due within 6 months of receiving samples.  Completing the work within 3 months is preferred.   The solicitation will be available on or about June 20, 2007, in paper hard copy and will be delivered via US Mail.  Interested parties may request a solicitation package by phone at (970) 586-1236, or by fax at (970) 586-1257.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>SERVICES TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE AND ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL HOSPITALS IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA REGION  
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting to obtain the services to support methods of improving access to quality health care services in the area defined as the Mississippi Delta, by the Delta Regional Authority, through efforts to improve the financial, operational and clinical performance of their rural hospitals with comprehensive and ongoing technical assistance. The target area includes 240 counties/parishes in the following eight states: Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.  The NAICS code is 5416111 with a size standard of 6.0 million dollars.  The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) was established by the Administration in August 1987, subsequently authorized by Congress in December 1987 and located within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  ORHP is charged in Section 711 of the Social Security Act with advising the Secretary of DHHS on the effects of current policies and proposed statutory, regulatory, administrative and budgetary changes in the programs established under Titles XVIII and XIX, the financial viability of small rural hospitals and other health care providers, the ability of rural areas (rural hospitals in particular) to attract and retain physicians, including other health professionals and access to (and the quality of) health care in rural areas.  ORHP is mandated to oversee compliance with the requirements of section 1102(b) of the Act and section 4083 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.  It is mandated to establish and maintain a clearinghouse for collecting and disseminating information on rural health care issues, research findings relating to rural health care and innovative approaches to the delivery of health care in rural areas.  ORHP is charged with coordinating rural health activities within the Department, with particular attention to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its programs.  This will also include related activities of other Federal agencies such as the Veterans Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  ORHP is to also work with States, State hospital associations, private associations, foundations and other organizations to find solutions to rural health care delivery problems.  These problems include but are not limited to shortages of health care providers and an aging and financially fragile health services delivery infrastructure.  The goal of the Rural Hospital Performance Improvement Project (RHPI) is to make accessible a portfolio of expert support services, business tools, and technical advice that is similar to those available to larger, urban hospitals for the sake of improving the viability of eligible hospitals. This project will provide on-site technical assistance to hospitals identified as being eligible to participate in effort to help them improve their financial, clinical and operational performance. Additionally, the project will (1) collect and disseminate business tools, information and data bases that hospitals can use to help themselves and (2) help build state and regional capacity that can continue to provide ongoing technical assistance to rural hospitals throughout the Delta.  This project will also include the introduction and implementation of performance management tools and methodologies for safety net providers.  Safety net providers have a mandate to provide health care to uninsured, Medicaid, and other vulnerable patients regardless of their ability to pay.  That mandate necessitates efficient operations of rural hospitals charged with being safety net providers.  The application of performance management tools and methodologies can assist in insuring the hospitals viability and in the maintenance of the safety net provider role for the community.  Many of the tools offer relatively simple management solutions that will enable the facilities and their boards of directors to take a comprehensive approach to their key strategies and ensure attention to the most critical areas of hospitals operations.  Additionally, performance management activities include educating hospitals staff on how to collect, analyze and use data to make decisions.  Effort should be made to educate local constituents, consultants and state health organization staff on how the adoption of the performance management activities affects the facility and their service area.  The Delta RHPI Project will work collaboratively with the Delta States Rural Development Network (DSRDN) Program, both of which comprise the Delta States Initiative that is supported by the Office of Rural Health Policy, HRSA, DHHS.    The contractor shall create relationships with the State Offices of Rural Health, State Hospital Associations, the American Hospital Association?s Center for Quality, as well as with sub-contractors as needed to address: Hospital Leadership, Board Development, Patient Centered Care, Hospital Quality Performance Measurement and Reporting, Information Technology and Physician and Workforce Engagement and Retention. The anticipated period of performance is for a twelve (12) month base year with four 12 month option years.   This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) will be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov approximately fifteen (15) days of this notice and can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations-Division of Procurement Management. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance/posting of the RFP. It shall be the offeror?s responsibility to monitor this website for the RFP and any amendments to the RFP. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources.  The contact person for this acquisition is: Debora A. Pitts, Contracts Operations Branch, DPM/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-3789 or 443-2750; FAX 301-443-6038.

The purpose of this acquisition is to support CEB analysis of global forest and agricultural GHG emissions, mitigation and impacts.  The contractor will develop a  combined forest and agriculture sectoral model for detailed analysis of global net GHG emissions and mitigation across the forest and agriculture sectors.  The contractor will also develop the forest sector of a global dynamic general equilibrium model and implement, evaluate and revise the Global  Trade Analysis Project land-use forestry database. Dr. Brent Sohngen and associates at Ohio State University have the unique expertise and skills to complete the tasks of this Purchase Order.  Dr. Sohngen maintains the Global Timber Model (GTM), an internationally regarded, state of the art global  forest economic climate model.  The GTM model is regarded as the premier economic model for global forest carbon sequestration analysis.  Over the past year, Dr. Sohngen and his students have been very active in successfully addressing a number of difficult methodological modeling challenges in  developing an initial dynamic global forest and agricultural model and collaborating with EPA and Purdue University in developing global general equilibrium models with explicit modeling of land-use behavior and responses to carbon prices.  These novel modeling frameworks and the new forest data  that they have used have been presented and vetted in a variety of professional meetings and documented in a number of draft book chapters and journal publications.  Dr. Sohngen also developed forest bioenergy modeling resources (data and biomass production structures) that can be introduced into  the global forest and agricultural modeling framework. This is not a request for quotation.  No contract will awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue,  N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.  Response to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  Consideration of responses is solely within the discretion of the Government, generally  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please include your number, point of contact, address, and telephone number.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  Environmental Protection Agency, Regional Laboratory.  This sole source justification is for the purchase of two (2) OI Analytical VOA Purge Systems,  Autosamplers. II.	 STATEMENT OF FACTS JUSTIFYING SOLE SOURCE AWARD:  The equipment that will be purchased is upgraded purge units for EPA?s existing trap units.  The upgraded instrumentation will provide the capability of increasing throughput of LDLVOA and DWVOA samples by nearly 100%. The purge  and trap units are mated units; it is necessary to keep the same manufacturer for the proper function and communication between the purge unit and the trap unit.  No other manufacturer?s equipment will communicate with the existing OI Analytical trap for LDLVOA and DWVOA samples.  Use of other  brand name autosamplers would require EPA to purchase both the purge and trap systems. The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses equipment, an upgraded OI Analytical purge that will function and communicate with our existing OI Analytical trap.  This unique equipment is  essential for contract performance because no other manufacturer?s equipment will function and communicate with the OI Analytical trap.  Also, no other vendor is authorized to distribute the autosamplers. III.	 OI Analytical is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirement(s).   OI Analytical is the manufacturer of the equipment and they are the only company that offers the upgraded purge unit. IV.	 STATEMENT OF ACTIONS TAKEN TO PRECLUDE THE NECESSITY FOR FUTURE SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION FOR THE SAME SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  This acquisition is for upgrades to an existing  system.  Manufacturers of similar purge and trap systems may have the ability to compete for future acquisitions of complete systems.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  PNNL researchers have developed a sensor that can characterize a particle or fiber suspension, which may be of particular interest to those in the papermaking industry. When refining wood pulp for paper, the mechanical action of the rotation and grooved circular refiner plates produces a pulp-fiber slurry.  The sensor monitors the slurry settling process using transducers on each side of the settling vessel. One transducer acts as a transmitter and other acts as a receiver. The signal in the receive transducer is affected by the pulp passing in front of it and essentially measures the pulp concentration. A peak in the signal occurs at a specific time, called the "peak time." The results show that the peak time is dependent upon the degree of refining, or the amount of time in the refiner. Consequently, the ultrasonic sensor can determine the degree of refining, making the refining process more efficient.  While this method was developed for wood pulp, it is applicable to many other mixtures where determining the appropriate size or morphology of fairly large particles is desired.  Advantages include (1) increased efficiency of the refining process and (2) real time monitoring of particle or fiber characteristics during the settling process.  A detailed description of the technology is provided in U.S. Patent No. 7,140,239.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:   PNNL researchers have developed a device and method for separating and transporting sub-millimeter size particles and providing various inspection means to rapidly characterize individual particles for quality control purposes. The system was successfully proven for inspecting 700-1000 micrometer diameter tri-isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles that contain several sophisticated coating layers. Billions of these coated fuel particles form the basic component for the fuel elements used in several current and proposed gas-cooled reactor designs.  PNNL designed a particle hopper feeder and a pneumatic transport line fitted with an induction coil and capacitance sensors to provide the quality control measurements without damaging the particles. Particles can then be separated into acceptable or unacceptable bins. The system may be scaled and incorporate other inspection modalities to meet specific client requirements. Potential applications are expected to be broad, including coated microspheres or other particles used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, or food industries.  Advantages include (1) extremely fast small particle transport and inspection, (2) adaptability to various sensor configurations and designs, and (3) provides a cleaning method for inspecting particles that have dust or debris inherent to their fabrication process.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) seeking information for market research and planning purposes.  The IRS will consider the information received in order to better understand industry capabilities as well as determine the best acquisition strategy.  This synopsis shall not be construed as either a solicitation or Request for Proposals (RFP).  No solicitation document currently exists; please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  The IRS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted to the IRS.  No acknowledgement of receipt of responses will be made, nor will respondents be notified of the IRS? evaluation of the information received.  Telephonic inquiries regarding this RFI will not be accepted.  Any question submitted regarding this potential requirement will not receive responses.  Interested firms are highly encouraged to participate in the establishment of our future requirement. 
The RFI detail document will be provided on the internet at https://www.fedteds.gov (FedTeDS), and is available on the IRS Procurement Business Opportunities website at: http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement/article/0,,id=171073,00.html additional documents may be added or existing documents may be replaced with revised versions.  Notification to Vendors/Contractors will be made via http://fedbizopps.gov if documents are added or replaced.
The IRS is requesting industry information regarding Contact Center Services to support the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Work Force Management (WFM), and Contact Recording technology components of its contact center infrastructure.  The Contact Centers are an infrastructure dedicated to support taxpayers who want to communicate with IRS via telephone network.  The IRS requests a high level description of the vendor?s approach, practices, and capabilities to provide the services requested in this RFI.  The vendors are also encouraged to propose alternative approaches that may be different than the requirements outlined in the RFI detail document published on the FEDTEDS system (identified above)
The scope of the Contact Center Support Services requested in this RFI includes both contractual and operational elements to support and improve IRS? existing operations. The scope of the Contractor services will include the maintenance and support of the IRS Aspect ACD, IVR, WFM, and Verint Contact Recording technology components, and their interoperability with other existing IRS contact center elements.  The high level objectives of this initiative, as defined by both the contracting and operations organizations, are summarized as follows.
Streamline service ordering process.  The new contracting vehicle will address ordering, managing, and accounting for day-to-day operational support required to expand or modernize the current technology.  The contracting organization will interface with one source for all services and supplies.
Improve incident response and troubleshooting process.  The Contact Center Support Services Contractor will be responsible for end-to-end system troubleshooting of technologies covered under the support services; minimizing the coordination requirements.  The Contact Center support services operation will implement a common methodology, based on the overall IRS incident and problem management approach, for classifying and tracking problems. The support structure will clearly define the lines of responsibility between organizations and the escalation procedures.
Improve quality of operations.  The contract will implement innovative proactive monitoring and management techniques to identify issues before they become performance impacting events. The Contractor will leverage root cause analysis to improve problem management.  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) will be established along with empirical performance measurements to measure and improve operations.  
Business Focus approach.  The system expansion and operations will be defined by IRS in terms of business needs. Contractor will be tasked with identifying solution options to meet these needs.  Proposed solutions will be presented to IRS and will be evaluated as part of the standard IRS change management process.
Common change management process.  The process for system and configuration changes will adhere to the overall IRS change and configuration management process.
Incorporate security as an integral process.  The contract will incorporate IRS security requirements into the overall technology planning, implementation and support process. The Contractor will be required to interface with the applicable internal and external security organizations and ensure that all vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes that would apply to this RFI would be 811213 Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance with the small business size standard of $6.5 million, and 334210 Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing with the small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  All responses must be submitted by e-mail to *AWSS RFI ICCSS@irs.gov in accordance with the following instructions:
Responses may not exceed ten (10) type written pages (MS Word) and should include each vendor?s name, address, and contact information.  The responses should briefly describe the company?s experience and qualifications with regard to the services listed above, indicating whether they functioned as a prime or subcontractor, and should reply to the specific questions contained in the ICCSS RFI detail document posted on FEDTEDS and the IRS Procurement Business Opportunities website.  The response should also include any experience, certifications, authorizations, etc. that the company may have with regard to the products and software identified in this RFI.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville, Florida intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MPRI, Inc. for Laser Marksmanship Training System (LMTS) equipment and incidental services.  This procurement will be processed under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals.  However, the Government will consider all quotes/proposals that clearly demonstrate the ability to meet the needs of the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This procurement is being processed under the authority of the test program for commercial items, Section 4202 of the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996.  The applicable NAICS code is 334419 with a size standard of 500 employees.
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION


1.  Contracting Activity.  

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville 

2.  Description of the Action Being Approved.  

This is a sole source action to be conducted under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  This sole source action is to use other than full and open competition to procure additional various Laser Marksmanship Training Systems (LMTS) equipment and incidental services from the original and sole manufacturer, MPRI, Inc.  MPRI, Inc. is located at 1201 East Abingdon Drive, Suite 425 Alexandria, Virginia 22314.  A firm-fixed price order on GSA schedule GS-02F-0209R is anticipated, as the majority of items to be procured are available on MPRI?s schedule.  

3.  Description of Supplies/Services. 

The proposed acquisition is to procure additional various equipment and incidental services in support of the LMTS for the Navy Reserve Forces Command, New Orleans from MPRI, Inc., the original manufacturer and sole provider of compatible system equipment.  System equipment includes: (345 each) M-16 Non-Guns, (69 each) Carrying cases for the M-16 Non-Guns, (5 each) 130 System, 10 Target, (5 each) CC-700 Carrying Case for Multiple TR-700 Targets, (2 each) Mini-rets 7-Target Sets, (165 each) LTX-Internal Lasers, (1700 each) slings for M-16 Non-Guns, (1 each) 390V5 System, (60 each) two-person missions to set up and configure system at various Reserve locations, (66 each) Daisy Chain Cables, (330 each) US Navy Mask Sets (TR700), (264 each) US Navy Overlay Pkg (TR900), (156 each) Mossberg 500 deactivated shotguns, (39 each) carrying cases for the shotgun, (90 each) 460/2 target systems (TR900), and (90 each) carrying cases for TR900.  Incidental services include setting up and calibrating the 390V5 system on-site; providing remedial training and instruction in the use of other LMTS equipment components; performance of an examination of the entire LMTS equipment system, to include the replacement and upgrade of certain consumables; the performance of a 100% inventory (noting missing items requiring replacement); a 100% function check of the equipment, and segregating certain components (CB-440 and M16 BLAZER upper receiver) no longer used.
 
The purpose of the equipment is to provide small arms training to Navy Reserve forces as part of the LMTS.  Reserve activities throughout the continental U.S., Guam, and Puerto Rico have the same training system configuration.  The purchase of various equipment for the LMTS allows the Navy Reserve Forces Command to accommodate their master plan of outfitting Reserve troops with the appropriate equipment for small arms training.  Various quantities will be shipped to Reserve locations, as determined necessary.  The purchase of the equipment is required before 30 September 2007.  

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  

The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.

5.  Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. 

This requirement will procure additional LMTS equipment as were purchased under N68836-05-F-1125, dated
29 September 2005, N68836-06-F-0364, dated 20 March 2006, and N68836-06-F-1668, dated 29 September 2006.  The system and system equipment are considered highly specialized equipment and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost, including training to the Fleet, warranty costs, and maintenance of all systems.  These costs could not be recovered through competition and would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.  The equipment for the LMTS must be compatible with the existing systems to fulfill training requirements to avoid additional costs, as previously mentioned.  Naval Reserve Command will be issuing these systems, and previously purchased systems, throughout their respective commands.  

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.  

The requiring activity and Contract Specialist have conducted market research among schedule holders, Thomas Register, and via the Internet.  The market research indicates no viable or compatible equipment exists.  In-house acquisition history indicates previous solicitations were advertised on GSA e-buy.  MPRI, Inc. was the sole offeror.  The requiring activity certifies, and the Contract Specialist confirmed, that the requirement can be met by a commercial item.  A commercial item determination is in the file.   

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.  

For the majority of items for this procurement, the General Services Administration (GSA) has already determined the price of supplies under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  However, the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Jacksonville, FL, as the ordering activity, will make the final reasonableness determination.   GSA negotiates contracts based on volume pricing, providing the Government with associated discounts not associated with open market procurements.  Therefore, the use of the schedule represents the lowest overall cost alternative and the best value to the Government.  For open market items, the Contracting Officer will be responsible for determining the price to the Government for the supplies/services covered by this J&A to be fair and reasonable.   

8.  Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.

For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, FISC Jacksonville has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies covered by this document. If other viable sources emerge, FISC Jacksonville will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. 

9. Contracting Activity Point Of Contact:  

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville, Florida primary point of contact is Kelley C. Wall, Contract Specialist, (904) 542-0126.  The secondary point of contact is J.S. Jackson, Contracting Officer, (904) 542-1264.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, HumanCNV370-2 Whole Genome Genotyping Kit with Illumina, Inc; 9885 Towne Centre Drive; San Diego, California 92121.

The supplies herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The purpose of this requirement is for the NCI laboratory to undertake a microarray genotyping project to identify SNPs, predisposing for sporadic papillary serous ovarian cancer. The Illumina HumanCNV370-duo platform provides the most complete, accurate, and detailed analysis of the specimens. The HumanCNV370-duo BeadChip contains over 370,000 informative SNP markers spanning the human genome. This set design uses polymorphic markers derived from Phase I and II of the HapMap project/study and additional content covering copy variant regions of the genome. 

The manufacturing technology, array design, and detection methods of the Illumina arrays are entirely owned by Illumina, Inc. Furthermore, it is not known to the NCI that there are any licensed systems, instruments, or arrays offered by third party providers that are able to use any component of the Illumina BeadChip genotyping system.  In addition, in order to satisfy the requirements of the HapMap project/study and ensure the data generated can be incorporated into an extensive pre-existing database derived using the HumanCNV370-duo BeadChip microarray platform, the proposed project must adhere to the conditions, reagents, and array platform previously used. Otherwise, subsequent data analysis and clinical validation will be compromised.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the current HapMap project/study.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement.  One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm ET on June 21, 2007.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must have a valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference NCI-70067-NG on all correspondence.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Purchase of a Meso Scale Sector Imager 2400

Purpose/Brief History:

The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) runs a laboratory and patient treatment clinic.  The ROB?s focus is on the treatment of cancer cells using radiation while trying to protect the normal cell tissue.  The laboratory research focuses on an array of experiments designed to study the various genetic markers that allow for cancer cells to be treated using a variety of medications and radiation, while protecting the surrounding tissue from cell damage or cell death.

The lab is seeking ECL and multiplexing platforms in measuring biomarkers in complex human and animal samples.  ECL has the highest signal and the lowest background and therefore the best measurement.  Multiplexing allows for one small sample for multiple measurements and having controls in the same well improves analycity.
    
PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 
(2)  For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

Justification:

ECL and Multiplexing are the most important features of this machine.  The Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager is the only imager known to the end user that has both ECL and Multiplexing functions.  

The Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager is the only machine that reads in sectors to improve optical resolution, has a integrated plate stacker and robotic interface, has ?no wash? assays, customizable patterned arrays, is compatible with well plate types 24, 96, 384, 1536, uses a disposable electrode as the binding site, has whole cell lysates sets available and simple protocols of five steps or less. In addition, the Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager machine allows for fast plate read times, surfactant free buffers and high throughput (100,000 determinations a day).

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to extend the term of the Treasury Communications System (TCS) contract number TIRNO-95-D-00099 with Northrop Grumman Information Technology, Inc. for two 12 month option periods pending the competitive award of the follow-on contract.  The TCS contract will expire September 27, 2007.  The Department of the Treasury does not anticipate award and complete transition of all sites before this contract expires.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Department of the Treasury has a continuing need for Wide Area Network (WAN) communications capabilities.  The extension of the TCS contract allows for uninterrupted WAN communications capabilities for the Department of the Treasury.  This extension enables Treasury to mitigate risks to the nation?s financial infrastructure and allows for successful transition to the follow-on contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with preparation and submission of data or any other cost incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>09302008
<CONTACT>Karen Shelley, (937) 904-4217
<DESC>Updated Information: The previous contract was an IDIQ contract, and we do not plan to utilize  that contract type for the contract which results from this RFI.  The  COMBS operations which are envisioned apply solely to the AUP equipment  and include managing the supply and running the counter, they do not  include flight line maintenance.  List of LRUs included in AUP  modification is attached. Additional Information: Current Contractor:  McDonnell Douglas Corporation - A Wholly Owned  Subsidiary of the Boeing Company in St Louis MO Current Contract Number: F41608-96-D-0700 Current Contract Expires on 30 Sep 2008 TITLE:  T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program CLS Sustainment Description:  1.  337th Aeronautical System Group (337 AESG), 663d  Aeronautical Systems Squadron (663 AESS) is contemplating a competitively  awarded contract for sustainment of the T-38C Avionics Upgrade Program  (AUP).  This Request for Information is intended to provide the Air Force  with an understanding of the interest within industry, the technology, and  resources available to support competitive acquisition of a contract to  cover contractor logistics support (CLS) sustainment of the avionics  suites of 450 AETC, 3 AFMC and 10 Navy T-38C AUP aircraft.  The T-38C AUP  avionics suite consists of approximately 60 non-developmental (NDI) and  commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  The CLS contract will be a  firm-fixed price, performance based service contract for the logistics  support and sustainment of the T-38C AUP consisting of a base year (FY09)  and with four additional years of FFP options.  The contract will provide  for: a)	Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations at  each of AETC’s T-38 main operating bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus  AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB and supporting operations  for Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS); b)	A CLS program to repair removed components at the contractor’s (or  Original Equipment Manufacturer’s) facilities and return to COMBS, based  upon a fixed price for each of the annual number of hours flown by AETC,  AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 110,000 hours total  annually); c)	Over and Above (O & A) activities necessary for correction of problems  found during maintenance; d)	Materials for the O & A corrections; e)	Technical data and technical manuals, recommendations to responsible  engineering organization; f)	Field Service Representatives at each of the AETC Main Operating Bases,  Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS; g)	An effective Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages  Management (DMSMS) program; h)	A system that collects, manages and archives Maintenance Fault Lists  (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL)/engine,  flight loads and ACMI data for each  flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis  and could lead to product improvement; i)	A damaged equipment program; j)	In coordination with organization having systems engineering  responsibility resolve any issues involving software support, engineering  services and material deficiency reporting; k)	and the program management necessary to support these activities. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed AUP components,  providing spares during repair process, performing Field Service  Representative tasks, and operation of a Contractor Operated Maintenance  Base Supply (COMBS) at each AETC MOB.  The period of performance for this  contract is planned FY09 through FY13. 2.  The T-38C CLS Sustainment approach will include performance based  logistics metrics for Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) at the avionics  level, and at the LRU level (system level avionics MTBF of 60 hours).  Guaranteed part turn-around times and issue rates at the COMBS are  planned.  In order to comply with the COMBS turn around times, the  contractor must assure that sufficient spares are available or other  arrangements are in place to assure that these times are met. Other  metrics and your suggestions for metrics will be considered.    A  technical data package (most current configuration) will be available in  Aug/Sep 2007.  The contractor must comply with the International Traffic  in Arms Regulations (ITAR) as required to support repairs if by foreign  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 3.  A companion program will be managed by ASC for software and  (potentially) hardware block upgrades to the T-38C avionics suite that are  necessary to assure that the T-38C AUP continues to provide AETC with  current up-to-date training capability.  Engineering and configuration  authority thus will rest with this ASC program.  The sustainment  contractor may need to establish associate contractor agreements with the  contractor performing the block upgrades.  The sustainment contractor  should plan for a low level of engineering change proposal activity  arising from the block upgrades, DMSMS, etc. 4.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423490.  The reference number for this Request for Quote (RFQ) is HM157507T0007.   NGA plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order under FAR Part 12 and 13.  The requirement is for the following items:

1) Body Armor - Medium in Size: Quantity: 85 each

2) Body Armor - Large in Size: Quantity: 10 each

Delivery: 30 days after award

The Specifications must be met: 

General Quality Requirements:  All materials are to be clean, brand new and free of any defects.  All workmanship is to be of first quality.  The Agency shall have the sole right to determine if this and all other requirements have been met.
Origin of Manufacture:  Only vest assembled entirely by United States citizens or persons who have legally immigrated and/or applied for United States citizenship will be considered for purchase.
Design Requirements: Concealable soft body armor intended for primary use as an undergarment worn concealed by a uniform or other type of shirt. This ballistic vest shall consist of two primary components- the ballistic panels enclosed by a protective Ballistic Panel cover and the Ballistic Vest Carrier or "outer-shell".
General Design and User Coverage. The soft body armor must provide maximum practical coverage for male and female officers for everyday wear.  However it must not bind or restrict user mobility or wearability.  The intent is provide full wrap, or overlap protection of the torso-coverage is to the maximum available consistent with wearability needs.  The soft body armor is defined as a vest with "full wrap" side panels that provide "overlap" protection. Suitable relief of not more than 1 inch should be allowed between the bottom edge of the vest and the gun belt when standing so that no binding occurs when the Officer is in the sitting position.  Ample relief must be provided in the armpit region for maximum mobility and a 2" or 3" scoop neck must be provided to maintain concealability and prevent the armor from showing when worn under a shirt with an open collar.
Ballistic Panels: The back and front armor panels should be one piece units made of Twaron/LFT Protexa and foam weave armor. The armor must meet or exceed National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 2005 Interim standards and preferably have MilSpec certification for Threat Level II protection from multiple hits and must have concurrent V-50 Ballistic Limit "benchmark" testing with the NIJ 2005 Interim testing and proof of certification and test reports must be submitted with this bid.

Level II Lbs/ft2(0.83)  Thinness(.29 inches)  V-50 9mm(1540) 
V-50 .357 (1562)  Backface 9mm(23.5) Backface .357 (32.38)
 	
Ballistic Panel Covers The armor must be contained in a heat sealed high elastic hydrolysis/microbial resistant polyurethane outer membrane such as VisiBALLISTICS(patent pending)that is opaque on one side and clear on the other. The membrane must be aromatic polyether polyurethane film/sheets with high crystallinity that facilitate bonding to substrates with water based adhesives.  Additional properties are functional flame retardant, high moisture vapor transfer rate and functional static dissipation.  This will provide the ballistic armor with added protection from moisture and odor while permitting a "Self Check" visual inspection system.  The ballistic covering (membrane) must be sealed by ultrasonic welding to prevent moisture penetration of the armor fibers.  The sonic seaming must hold fabric together as such tensile strength of seal is greater than the components on their own.  You must not be able to pull seam or weld apart once the materials are sonically sealed or welded. The membrane must have Velcro tabs that can attach to the inside of the inner face of the carrier for stability of the armor panels must be contained There must be an additional soft trauma plate which also meets or exceeds NIJ standards and having concurrent V-50 "benchmark" testing to fit in the carrier front as described below. Included in bid material, minimum testing must be conducted and written verification sent in of below testing.
 
Specific Gravity: ASTM Test Method (D-792)and Value (1.12)
Durometer (Shore A): ASTM Test Method (D-2240) and Value (86.88)
Ultimate Tensile Strength: ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value (8,300 psi)
Ultimate Elongation: ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value (550%)
50% Modulus (ND/CD Ave): ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value (950 psi)
100% Modulus (MD/CD Ave: ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value (1,200 psi)
300% Modulus (MD/C Ave: ASTM Test Method (D-882) and Value (2,800 psi)
Tear Resistance (MD/CD Ave): ASTM Test Method (D-1004) and Value (450 psi)
Approximate Yield (Sq. ft/lb @ 1 mil: Value (170)

Ballistic Panel labels:  Concurrent with the NIJ-STD-2005 Interim Requirement, each ballistic panel shall have a label that contains the Manufacturer's name, Threat Level, Size, Model, Lot and Serial Numbers, Date of Manufacture, Strike Face, Care instructions, Certification of Compliance and required warnings on vest limitations according to the NIJ-STD-2005 Interim Requirements.
Ballistic Panel Concealed Label:  Each ballistic vest must also contain a concealed label to enable future tracing of the panel by model, serial and lot number, and date of manufacture.
Ballistic Vest Carrier:  two black in color VERTEX multi adjustable carriers will be issued with each vest. Each carrier must have two stealth plate pockets so that the wearer has the option of using either a standard 5x8 inch (13cmx20cm) or an optional 7x10 inch (18cmx25cm) armor plate. Materials used in the construction of the carriers' inner face must be a knit mesh with moisture management, anti-odor, microbial properties on the body side and have Velcro tabs to hold the upper (shoulder) wings of the armor in place and contribute to the stability of the armor in the carrier.  The Face (outer) side of the carrier must be constructed with 75Dx75D Super Mini-Ripstop made of 1005 polyester.  The material must have a DWR finish and weight of 2.7 oz/yd2 with a breaking strength of 160.5#/inch warp and 102.4 inch fill.  Wear abrasion on this fabric must exceed over 20,000 cycles and have a shrinkage warp of 0.8% and 0.4% fill. Carriers should have a four point Velcro strap system with the side straps no narrower than four (4) inches and no wider than four and one half inches (4 1/2) to permit proper and secure fitting.  All carriers must come with attached shirttails; have zippered access slots for the removal and insertion of the armor panels, not Velcro, except for the torso trauma plate pouch which should be Velcro sealed. 
Product Consistency: The manufacturer must warrant that all shipments of each certified model will be identical in design and construction to that which was originally certified.  The manufacturer and NIJ must have retained samples from the original certification for verification and/or inspection.

<SOLNBR>OSLM0002
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>07072007
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-7975, Fax 813-826-7504, Email richard.boast@socom.mil
<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of an Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM).  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is researching the use of a light and compact laser marker system to mark targets for Laser Spot Track (LST) capable aircraft.  

Combat operations require Fire Support elements to be able to mark targets for LST capable aircraft from MOUNT and rural environments.  This laser marker must be light and compact enough for soldiers to carry on helicopter assaults and foot movements.  Reducing the size and weight of Fire Support equipment (e.g. Laser Target Designators (LTDs), Radios, Infrared (IR) pointers, etc.) is critical to ensure soldiers are able to carry vital equipment during all possible infiltration/exfiltration options.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue, provide accurate target mark/identification (ID) in order to accurately engage enemy targets and ensure mission success. The tasks proposed by the customer in this Request for Information (RFI) shall provide for specifications of the (OSLM) for use in developmental and operational testing.  

This RFI is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the OSLM.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.  The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  Moreover, it is requested the respondees provide information specifically addressing those items/specifications that can not be achieved during this effort.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 2 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements of the current customer?s Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) of approximately 10 systems.

<CONTACT>CATHY J. BASU, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2042, E-Mail: basu.cathy@epa.gov
<DESC>The synopsis for this procurement action is being amended to add the following comments: Significant potential exists for an organizational conflict of interest under this procurement.  Therefore it is considered in the best interest of the Government to exclude all non-road engine manufacturers.  Firms in the above-mentioned group shall not be considered for award under this solicitation either as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or as a consultant and/or technical services provider to the prime contractor or subcontractor.  Furthermore, all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan requiring them to identify the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual organizational conflicts of interest can be mitigated, avoided or neutralized. The solicitation will contain the following provision, "Industries Prohibited from Being Considered for Award".  The text of the clause will be as follows: 	Contractor support is required in the area of emissions testing on small, non-road engines.  The contractor that provides such support must be free from actual organizational conflicts of interest in order to ensure that it does not obtain a competitive advantage and reduce the large financial investment already made by small engine manufacturers who provide the prototype engines involved in this work effort.  There must also be an assurance against the contractor providing biased results and/or having it?s objectivity questioned.                     Therefore, all non-road engine manufacturers are ineligible for award of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  Firms in the above-mentioned groups shall not be considered for award under this solicitation either as a prime contractor, subcontractor or as a consultant and/or technical services provider to the prime contractor or subcontractor.  The specific determination whether any other offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case-by-case basis.  The anticipated release date is June 15, and the close date is approximately 30 days thereafter.   ************************************************************************************* Per the Energy Act of 2005, a minimum level of renewable fuel use in the transportation sector must occur, beginning in 2006. The majority of this renewable fuel is expected to be ethanol. EPA?s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD),  has a requirement to estimate the impact of the increased use of renewable fuels in Class I and Class II Nonroad engines.  OTAQ  is investigating the use of the renewable fuel, ethanol,  in a blend with gasoline at a volumetric content of approximately 10% ethanol. OTAQ?s testing program will improve the EPA?s ability to estimate the impact of this  increased use of renewable fuels on gasoline emissions.  The successful contractor shall provide the Agency with a testing program that will focus on small non-road engines which meet EPA?s Phase II emission standards. The testing program will also include three fuels with an option for a fourth.  The base quantity will consist of testing eight engines using three fuels in accordance with the specifications identified in the statement of work.  EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, shall provide all personnel, materials, services, equipment and facilities to perform the tasks identified in the Performance Work Statement. The tasks to be performed under the Performance Work Statement include: (1) Provide a QAPP (Quality Assurance Project Plan), governing the conduct of research for this project at the contractor?s facility; (2) Engine Correlation Testing to establish the contractor?s ability to perform the tests satisfactorily; (3) Engine Dynamometer Aging to break in and age engines to half of their useful life; (4) Emissions Testing, using the 6-mode steady-state A-cycle, which conforms to Title 40 CFR 90; (5) Emissions Reports reflecting ongoing testing and a final report.   Options may be exercised in order to complete the following optional tasks: (Option 1) Testing on E-20 requires that three additional emission tests are performed on each engine on E-20; (Option 2) Alternate Approach Emissions Testing requires engine testing using governed operation in Mode Point 1 of the test cycle; (Option 3) Testing to Measure Pre-Catalyst Emissions on 1-2 engines to measure pre-catalyst emissions; (Option 4) Limited Testing to Measure Pre-Catalyst Emissions on a single fuel; (Option 5) Disposition of Test Articles to ship the engines to another location; (Option 6) Additional Engine Tests requests pricing from the contractor for additional engine aging, testing and reporting. EPA anticipates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with one 12 - month base period, and six (6) options for additional testing, engines and/or fuel. The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis; it will not be a small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.			 Solicitation No. PR-CI-07-10362 is expected to be issued in mid April and to close approximately 30 days thereafter.  It will be available on the Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and visit the website for continuous updates on the RFP?s status.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.  The center will provide the appropriate staff such as guards and maintenance personnel as necessary for the oversight of the work effort.  The contractor will provide labor, materials, and waste disposal as appropriate for this project.

1.5  Contract Type.  Firm Fixed Price Contract
 
1.6	Place of Performance/Hours of Operation.  The building where the work will be performed is a government-owned structure and is identified as Building #1.  the location of the building is within the Center?s confines at the following address:

<SUBJECT>R--Concession Prospectus
<SOLNBR>07SS240008
<RESPDATE>090107
<ARCHDATE>06062008
<CONTACT>Marie S. Spurgeon Contracting Officer 9169897218     mspurgeon@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation  intends to issue a Prospectus to solicit proposals from interested Small Business concerns on the next term of concession contracts for the development, operation and maintenance of visitor services and facilities at Lake Berryessa, Solano Project, Napa County, California (Lake Berryessa).  The Prospectus, draft contract and all supporting documentation is available at the Lake Berryessa Prospectus website http://www.usbr.gov/mp/berryessa/prospectus.html.  The Prospectus outlines business opportunities for seven concession areas at Lake Berryessa to be provided by private individuals or companies in accordance with Reclamation's Record of Decision (ROD) for the Future Recreation Use and Operations of Lake Berryessa dated June 2, 2006.  The existing concession contracts between Reclamation and the existing concession contractors expire on the dates listed below: Pleasure Cove Marina                   December 1, 2007 Rancho Monticello Resort             June 15, 2008	                 Spanish Flat Resort		      July 13, 2008           Lake Berryessa Marina	      August 13, 2008          Putah Creek Resort		      August 13, 2008       Markley Cove Resort 	      May 26, 2009          Steele Park Resort		      May 26, 2009      The concession history at Lake Berryessa since 1959 and the issues that culminated from the previous 6 years of planning, completion of an Environmental Impact Statement, and the recent ROD as well as the upcoming expiration of the existing seven concession contracts at Lake Berryessa (December 1, 2007, through May 26, 2009) make this prospectus a unique document different in many ways from standard or traditional prospectuses that offerors may have previously seen. Because of the significant changes mandated by the ROD, the concession opportunities at Lake Berryessa will result in new operations and a different commercial focus to the extent that visitor use patterns and the character of operations will be very different than they have been since the current contracts were authorized in 1958-1962.  At Lake Berryessa, all the facilities and services provided through the seven expiring contracts have been re-described, through the identified planning process, in a manner that will result in business models and operations extremely different from the historical Lake Berryessa concession operations.  Furthermore, the plan and the associated ROD purposefully described the new operations in a somewhat global approach that provides a very flexible and many-faceted set of business opportunities for bidders wishing to compete for a concession contract(s).   The Prospectus therefore places a high premium on creativity by the bidders because there are many options available for them to work within. Reclamation will select successful bidders based in part upon the proposal(s) that appears to have the most reasonable approach for:  (1) serving the publics' demand for quality water-based recreation support services and facilities, (2) protecting the environment, (3) responding positively to the 'Principal Factors' and 'Criterions' outlined in the prospectus, and (4) introducing an integrated business approach as identified in the ROD and in the prospectus, all while demonstrating a well-developed financial projection for a reasonable profit. Any offer, including that of the existing concession contractors, must be received by the Bureau of Reclamation, Central California Area Office, 7794 Folsom Dam Road, Folsom, California  95630, on or about September 1, 2007 in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract under the terms described in the Prospectus.  Proposals are due no later than 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 7, 2007.   Interested parties should include the following information in their response:  Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard. Effective October 1, 2003, any contractor to be awarded a government contract must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Contractors MUST register at http:www.ccr.gov.  Failure to register will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offers from all responsible sources will be considered.   Effective January 1, 2005, any contractor submitting a quotation, offer or proposal to the Government must complete their Representations and Certifications online.  All the representations and certifications which used to be submitted within Section K are now located online.  Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) can be completed at http://orca.bpn.gov.    Requests for site visit, and all contractual technical questions must be submitted in writing to Pete Lucero, plucero@mp.usbr.gov; (707) 966-2111, x. 106 or fax (707) 966-0409.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  It is requested that the Marine Forces Reserve Band commission the composition of a Symphonic Wind Ensemble (Concert Band) work for the Marine Forces Reserve Band.  This request is in keeping with the intent of the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve of musically capturing the spirit of the City of New Orleans in an anthem of rebirth following the Hurricanes of 2005. 

2.  The overview of this project includes musically portraying the city of New Orleans and her people; their shared catastrophe of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, their separation and isolation as they were driven away and displaced throughout the United States, and their return, reunion and rebirth with a resolve to rebuild their city and their future.

3.  The cost of this work is to include/cover the following:

     a.    Composer should have experience writing for Military Symphonic Bands.
"Military Symphonic Bands" the difference between
military and civilian symphonic bands, is we have fewer Woodwinds, which the composer will need to take into consideration.  If this helps:

Military Symphonic Band Instrumentation:
	- 3 Flute/Piccolo
	- 5 Bb Clarinet
	- 1 Bass Clarinet
	- 1 Oboe
	- 1 Bassoon
	- 2 Alto Saxophone
	- 1 Tenor Saxophone
	- 1 Baritone Saxophone
	- 7 Trumpets
	- 3 French Horns
	- 3 Tenor Trombones
	- 1 Bass Trombone
	- 1 Euphonium
	- 3 Tubas
	- 5 Percussion (Full Battery)

**Civilian Symphonic Bands are used to having 9-12 Clarinets (where we have only 5), they have 5 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Bassoons, etc...  The big difference is the instrumentation make up (listed above) which the Composer needs to know to avoid limitation and maximize our assets.

     b.   Composer should have an understanding of the history of New Orleans and a working knowledge of the music associated with the city.

     c.   Composer should have knowledge of the events associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the damage to New Orleans, the evacuation, and the effects on the people separated from their city.

     d.   Composition of a Grade V/VI Concert work up to a length of 10 minutes.

     e.   Must have time to make on-sight visit to the New Orleans area to:

	(1)  Meet with the Commander of Marine Forces Reserve

	(2)  Meet the Marine Forces Reserve Band who will be performing the work, and assess their capabilities and abilities.

	(3)  Visit the New Orleans Metro area, tour and observe the Hurricane Damage, the areas that are devastated, the areas already recovered, the areas currently rebuilding, and those yet to be recovered.  This visit/tour is essential for the composer to truly capture - what has happened/is currently happening ? in the composition.

4.  The benefits to the Command and the Community are the community relations outreach project between the Marine Corps and the local areas that our military service and family members are a part of during their tour of duty.  To have this piece of music composed for the city and its people, and debuted by the Band that experienced the same tragedy, will further show and enhance the Military?s support and dedication to their host community.  The Concert event that will debut this composition will gain positive National media attention for the Marine Corps and the Local Community.

5.  The follow-on benefits to the Command are that after the Marine Forces Reserve Band has debuted this work, it will be available world-wide for High Schools, Universities, and Professional Wind Ensembles to perform this piece.  The performance notes of this piece will include that it was commissioned by the Marine Forces Reserve for the City of New Orleans? continuing to pass on the original community relations intent of this work, and further enhancing/maintaining a positive image of the Marine Corps to National/International audiences.

6.  If there are any questions regarding this request, please feel free to contact Ms. Cynthia Smith at (504)678-8262.  Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

The containers dimensions are 11 feet 4 inches in diameter and 6 feet 6 inches in height and have a volume of 16 m3.  These containers will require oversize permits for over the road transportation.

b.Transport the materials to a currently licensed offsite facility permitted to receive at least Class A radioactive materials. Since some materials are classified, a specific security plan approved by the Department of Energy will be required.

c.Process the containers to remove contents, sort and segregate nonconforming items, repackage the waste for shipment to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) for disposal using a NTS certified program.
 	
d.The vendor must have an existing DOE approved security plan and L/Q cleared personnel for performing this work.

<CONTACT>James Thompson, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 703-562-2593, Fax 703-562-2554, Email jamethompson@fdic.gov
<DESC>I am requesting information from interested sources on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  The request is for information only, and your response is not an offer. This request for information neither commits the FDIC to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission to this sources sought request, nor does it obligate the Corporation to contract for services or include you in a potential solicitation mailing list. 

The FDIC has an ongoing requirement to acquire contractor support for consolidated facility management services at headquarters owned buildings.

Consolidated Facilities Management Services 
As general background, the FDIC owned facilities in the Washington DC area include the following basic particulars:

550 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.; Year built: 1962-1963 Gross space: 234,293 square feet; Usable space: 170,669 square feet Number of occupants: 445
1776 F Street, N.W. Washington, D.C.; Year built: 1972 Gross space: 198,493 square feet; Usable space: 132,597 square feet Number of occupants 381
VA Square Complex; Years built: 1989 & 2005; Gross space: 1,600,000 square feet; Usable space: 850,000 square feet; Parking garage gross square feet: 557,000; Number of occupants: 2,000

The FDIC is accustomed to a high level of facilities management services.  To illustrate, using the Association of Higher Education Facilities Officers (APPA) Service Level Guide as a benchmark, the FDIC Washington area facilities should be maintained at Level 1 (Showpiece Facilities) for maintenance and custodial services.  Further, the contractor shall partner with FDIC Facilities Staff to identify energy conservation measures, both short and long term major repairs, and capital improvements.  In addition, FDIC expects the contractor to align its preventive maintenance program to parallel life-cycle costing that is established for various building systems and equipment to maximize the building systems life-expectancy.

The following are examples of the types of facility management services required.

Operations, Maintenance and Repairs
The contractor shall perform scheduled preventive maintenance utilizing a Reliability Centered Maintenance approach and in accordance with the best practices of the industry.  The contractor shall be responsible for responding to service calls and performing repairs including unscheduled maintenance.  Services are required twenty-four (24) hours a day, 365 days per year including emergency service call response.

Elevator Maintenance and Repairs
The contractor shall perform elevator inspections, routine and preventive maintenance, repairs, and emergency callback services. Minor repairs to fix doors off-track, doors, etc.  Maintenance services are required twenty-four hours a day.

Janitorial Services
The contractor shall perform complete janitorial services (includes window washing); trash removal services; carpet and upholstery cleaning, and snow removal services in each of the FDIC owned buildings.

Landscaping and Interior Plant Maintenance
The services encompass the landscaping grounds, equipment maintenance (including tree boxes located on the city and county sidewalks) and all interior building decorative plant maintenance for FDIC facilities.

Pest Control
The contractor shall provide pest control services for common areas, offices, and other FDIC designated locations noted within this Statement of Work (SOW). Examples of treatments would consist of spot or crevice spraying, use of glue boards, baits, bait stations, growth inhibitors, etc., or other methods deemed effective.

Environmental Management System
The contractor shall obtain services necessary to maintain existing Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and continue to evaluate systems for effectiveness and, when necessary, recommend improvements and upgrades to systems that will benefit building operations. 

FDIC has three (3) different EMS's in operation: Trane Tracer Summit at the Virginia property, Andover Infinity at the 1776 F St. property Honeywell Excel Building Supervisor at 550 17th Street. 

Interior Office Construction
Occupied space currently totals more than 1.2 million square feet. These general construction services shall include interior renovation, construction and maintenance work. Services may include, but are not limited to, painting, demolition of existing partitions, erection of new partitions, installing of doors and frames, creating millwork, reworking as needed of HVAC and fire sprinkler systems, and providing electrical and cabling services. 


Information and Input Requested
The FDIC is considering entering into an extended relationship with the contractor(s) for these services.  Please provide your input on fee structures and pricing mechanisms for all services and insight regarding how far in advance you can propose option period management fees.

The FDIC is interested in your comments on pricing structure for the operation of all of the major components of the contract.  In other words, how would you propose pricing terms for the various required services such as a fixed monthly fee, or on a unit price basis for various services?

Historically, the routine building operation and maintenance and janitorial services are provided on a fixed price basis.  The larger maintenance projects and repairs beyond a stated threshold are issued via work order and paid on a reimbursable basis.  Unit prices are established for most interior construction services required.

However, if you have alternate suggestions that are aligned with industry practices that will benefit both your firm and the FDIC, we strongly encourage your input.

Also, we are interested for information purposes in learning more about current industry practices regarding reliability centered maintenance and energy savings measures.  FDIC is also interested in key performance indicators (KPIs) that are applied to establish levels of performance, and contractor incentives or bonuses.  Finally, FDIC is interested in learning how contractor implementation of enhanced occupational and environmental safety and health programs such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Voluntary Protection Program Guidelines (VPP Program) have resulted in actual cost savings for its clients.

The FDIC complies with the Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act for all applicable services.

Also, the FDIC is interested in firms that are strong supporters of providing subcontracting opportunities to small and small disadvantaged businesses.

If your firm is interested in all or any of these potential requirements, you are requested to submit the following information by noon June 25, 2007:

A letter of interest.  Also, please specifically identify which areas (as identified by the major heading and subheadings in this announcement) your firm is interested in providing.
A brief overview of your firm's capabilities that addresses the above listed potential requirements.  Please do not exceed ten pages.  However, feel free to submit any pre-created marketing literature to supplement the requirement.
A list of clients or experience in these areas.
A point of contact with phone number and email.

If this does become a firm requirement, and the FDIC decides to request a proposal from your firm, you will be advised later this year.

Submissions are preferred electronically via email, but if you only have hardcopies of your marketing literature available, please fax them to 703-562-2554.

Questions or requests for clarification may be made to me at 703-562-2593 or via email at jamethompson@fdic.gov. The FDIC appreciates your time in responding to this matter.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Advanced Technology Program (ATP), intends to negotiate with the National Governors Association (NGA), Washington, DC, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).   The goals of the acquisition are to:

a) Understand the changing nature of innovation and what it means to industry, universities, state and federal government;

b) Study and document trends in innovation industry-state-university partnerships;

c) Study and document examples of industry-university partnerships in other countries and policy mechanisms used to encourage and support them;

d) Improve policy maker?s understanding of the relationship between public policy, innovation, and the role of partnerships; and

e) based on the findings of the acquisition, provide practical guidance to governors on how to best encourage and support university-industry partnerships and optimally leverage existing infrastructure programs such as the NIST ATP Program and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Program.

Based on recent market research, and the fact that NGA?s Center for Best Practices is the nation?s only dedicated consulting firm for governors and their key policy staff, NIST believes that only NGA can satisfy NIST?s requirement to complete a study to understand the components of successful industry-state-university partnerships in promoting innovation and to provide recommendations for promoting these partnerships.  The objective of this industry-state-university partnerships project is to understand the characteristics of successful partnerships.  

The NGA will be required to release a series of Issue Briefs at regular intervals during the acquisition and a Summary Report that highlights and synthesizes key findings from the acquisition.  In addition to guidance for governors, specific recommendations will be sought as to the role the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) might play within these partnerships and effectively contribute to improving U.S. economic performance.  The NAICS Code is 813920 with a Size Standard of $5.0 million.

NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a cost-reimbursement (no fee) type contract for a base period of twelve months and one twelve-month option to extend the term of the contract.  

Interested parties may identify their interest; however, such parties must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Jill Johnson at jill.johnson@nist.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- Develop Relationships at State and  Local Level for NIST MEP
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NB480000-7-04439
<RESPDATE>061507

<CONTACT>Jill Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-6394, Fax 301-975-8884, Email jill.johnson@nist.gov - Joseph Widdup, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 975-6324, Fax (301) 975-8884, Email joseph.widdup@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Program, intends to negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) with State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI), Westerville, Ohio, to develop relationships at the state and local levels that are critical to the success of NIST?s (MEP) Program.

NIST MEP has a system of Centers and field offices throughout the U.S. provides a mechanism to integrate Federal and state public policy goals responding to market forces and addressing the needs of individual manufacturers.  To make the most of this partnership, NIST MEP strives to balance the priorities of U.S. national policy with those of state partners to create a robust and effective program providing U.S. manufacturers with the tools they need to grow and remain globally competitive.  The objective of the State Relations Team is to develop and implement strategies that will enhance relationships between NIST MEP Centers and multiple stakeholders and participants in the MEP system.  Given the unique nature of the MEP network, success depends on the understanding and alignment of state policy goals and objectives with national policy to create a partnership that leverages the strength of each entity.  As the program evolves, MEP increasingly is focused on helping manufacturers identify and adopt new technologies for improved products, process, business practices and the development of new products.  Two factors will impact the success of this effort: 1) Understanding the priorities of state officials, as well as agency missions, resources, capabilities and agendas, and 2) Developing the capacity to align these agendas with MEP priorities supporting innovation and technology transfer in manufacturing.  In support of this effort, the NIST MEP uses a State Relations Team to develop and implement strategies that will enhance relationships between MEP Centers and multiple stakeholders and participants in the MEP system.

SSTI has developed a nationwide network of practitioners and policymakers dedicated to improving the economy through science and technology. This national network provides SSTI with unique access to information. SSTI uses this access to assist states and communities as they build tech-based economies, conduct research on best practices and trends in tech-based economic development, and encourage cooperation among and between state and federal programs. SSTI is the nation's only organization dedicated exclusively to technology-based economic development, and it serves as a resource center for organizations interested in transforming regional economies through science, technology, and innovation. 

Based on the foregoing unique capabilities and experience of SSTI and based on NIST?s extensive recent market research, NIST has not identified any other sources that can provide the required services to develop relationships at the state and local levels that are critical to the success of NIST?s (MEP) Program.

NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a cost-reimbursement (no fee) contract with SSTI for a base period of twelve months from date of award and four (4) one-year options to extend the term of the contract for the aforementioned required services.  The NAICS Code for the acquisition is 813920 with a size standard of $5.0 million.

Interested parties may identify their interest; however, such parties must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures may be used by the Government.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Jill Johnson at jill.johnson@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.

Currently,  Centennial Job Corps has students using the old version of the Plato Learning Program who have another two years in the Job Corps program; it is beneficial to them to continue using the Plato Learning Program.This is an advantage to the teachers as well, who have been using the program since 1997, transition to the Plato Learning web based version will involve minimal training. The web based program has been tested and is compatible with the computers being used on the Center.  Although this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, persons interested in this requirement may identify their capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  All information received by 4:00 PM MST, June 14, 2007, will be considered by the Government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>B -- RACK PRICE DATA  FOR  ALL U.S. TERMINALS
<DESC>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue a procurement under other than full and open competition to Oil Price Information Services (OPIS) 11300 Rockville Pike,#1100 Rockville, MD 20852-3030,  a specialized company that provides comprehensive information on rack (wholesale) and retail gasoline prices and expert consulting on the U.S. gasoline rack market. 

Specifically, the data will contain the fol1owing information: rack price data for regular unleaded gasoline for all U.S. terminals from 2000 to the latest in 2007 in weekly averages of the daily prices and a list of companies posting rack prices at terminals. The prices should be for branded and unbranded by company, major product specifications (conventional, reformulated and CARB) by company and by additives (e.g., clear, 5%, 7% ethanol, high/low RVP, etc).  For each rack the following should be included: average price, low rack average; high rack average; average for branded: low average for branded; high average for branded; average for unbranded; average low for unbranded; average high for unbranded; contract average, gasoline spot market for the rack; spot replacement index (identify origin) where available; ownership of terminal: proprietary and nonproprietary. Also, please identify racks that are aggregations of other racks: For example, is Dallas/Metro rack an aggregation of racks in the Dallas/Forth Worth metro area?

It is widely known in the U.S. oil industry that OPIS is the only source of this type of comprehensive and detailed data and market information on the U.S. rack gasoline market. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Full W aveform LiDAR acquires data at 60k pts/second and 2048 samples per second.  The surveys required provides the ability to acquire topographic data at a scale that is sufficient to delineate vegetation boundaries at the top of the canopy and the bare earth m odel for fluvial wetland features.  This data is required to allow researchers to reconstruct the actual surfaces encountered by the instrument and not false surfaces often interpolated with other non-waveform LiDAR instruments and post processing.  Notice  closes 15 June 2007.  POC Lou Ann Duffy at 603-646-4280 or lou.ann.duffy@erdc.usace.army.mil.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this  solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the  solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other  factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate  offers: Proposals will be evaluated to determine (1) technical capability of  whether and how well the offeror can provide the required administrative  services to meet the Government need, (2) the extent to which the offeror  has an acceptable past performance record, and (3) which offer provides  the lowest price to the government.  The technical capability and past  performance will be evaluated in descending order of importance and when  combined will be more important than the price.  However, the price will  be given increased weight in making the award decision as the other  factors of competing proposals become more nearly equal. b.      A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or  otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for  acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract  without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified  expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer),  whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written  notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  It is requested that the Marine Forces Reserve Band commission the composition of a Symphonic Wind Ensemble (Concert Band) work for the Marine Forces Reserve Band.  This request is in keeping with the intent of the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve of musically capturing the spirit of the City of New Orleans in an anthem of rebirth following the Hurricanes of 2005. 

2.  The overview of this project includes musically portraying the city of New Orleans and her people; their shared catastrophe of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, their separation and isolation as they were driven away and displaced throughout the United States, and their return, reunion and rebirth with a resolve to rebuild their city and their future.

3.  The cost of this work is to include/cover the following:

     a.    Composer should have experience writing for Military Symphonic Bands.
"Military Symphonic Bands" the difference between
military and civilian symphonic bands, is we have fewer Woodwinds, which the composer will need to take into consideration.  If this helps:

Military Symphonic Band Instrumentation:
	- 3 Flute/Piccolo
	- 5 Bb Clarinet
	- 1 Bass Clarinet
	- 1 Oboe
	- 1 Bassoon
	- 2 Alto Saxophone
	- 1 Tenor Saxophone
	- 1 Baritone Saxophone
	- 7 Trumpets
	- 3 French Horns
	- 3 Tenor Trombones
	- 1 Bass Trombone
	- 1 Euphonium
	- 3 Tubas
	- 5 Percussion (Full Battery)

**Civilian Symphonic Bands are used to having 9-12 Clarinets (where we have only 5), they have 5 Flutes, 2 Oboes, 2 Bassoons, etc...  The big difference is the instrumentation make up (listed above) which the Composer needs to know to avoid limitation and maximize our assets.

     b.   Composer should have an understanding of the history of New Orleans and a working knowledge of the music associated with the city.

     c.   Composer should have knowledge of the events associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the damage to New Orleans, the evacuation, and the effects on the people separated from their city.

     d.   Composition of a Grade V/VI Concert work up to a length of 10 minutes.

     e.   Must have time to make on-sight visit to the New Orleans area to:

	(1)  Meet with the Commander of Marine Forces Reserve

	(2)  Meet the Marine Forces Reserve Band who will be performing the work, and assess their capabilities and abilities.

	(3)  Visit the New Orleans Metro area, tour and observe the Hurricane Damage, the areas that are devastated, the areas already recovered, the areas currently rebuilding, and those yet to be recovered.  This visit/tour is essential for the composer to truly capture - what has happened/is currently happening ? in the composition.

4.  The benefits to the Command and the Community are the community relations outreach project between the Marine Corps and the local areas that our military service and family members are a part of during their tour of duty.  To have this piece of music composed for the city and its people, and debuted by the Band that experienced the same tragedy, will further show and enhance the Military's support and dedication to their host community.  The Concert event that will debut this composition will gain positive National media attention for the Marine Corps and the Local Community.

5.  The follow-on benefits to the Command are that after the Marine Forces Reserve Band has debuted this work, it will be available world-wide for High Schools, Universities, and Professional Wind Ensembles to perform this piece.  The performance notes of this piece will include that it was commissioned by the Marine Forces Reserve for the City of New Orleans? continuing to pass on the original community relations intent of this work, and further enhancing/maintaining a positive image of the Marine Corps to National/International audiences.

6.  If there are any questions regarding this request, please feel free to contact Ms. Cynthia Smith at (504)678-8262.  Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

<DESC>Full and Open Competition ? Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ? F1STAB7113
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 2007-01-22.  NAICS is 488190 with a small business size standard of 6.50M annualy.  Solicitation is for commercial services. 

This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.  

AFFTC/PKEAB, Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing the following service:  Aircraft painting services for an L-23 sailplane.  

1.1	Sailplane Description.  The sailplane is an L-23 Super Blanik, registration number N268BA.  The airframe is metal with fabric covered control surfaces.  The wings and horizontal stabilizer assembly are removable.  This allows the aircraft to be placed onto a trailer and towed behind a vehicle.  The current empty weight of the sailplane is 709.9 Lbs.  Max certificated gross weight is 1124 lbs.  The paint currently on the aircraft was applied by the manufacturer approximately 10 years ago. The aircraft has never been repainted. 

1.2	Delivery of Aircraft.  The sailplane may be delivered to the contractor in one of two ways.  
1.2.1	The preferred delivery method is by aerotow.  TPS will provide a ferry crew to fly the sailplane from its current location to the contractor facility.  The sailplane will be delivered as is.  The government will not be responsible for disassembling the aircraft to any extent.  
1.2.2	The second option is for the sailplane to be delivered via trailer.  TPS will be responsible for removing the wings and horizontal stabilizer prior to delivering the sailplane to the contractor facility. All parts will then be delivered to the contractor facility on a single open frame trailer. Under this option, the contractor may choose to keep the trailer at the contractor facility for temporary storage of parts throughout the duration of the contracted services.
1.2.3	Upon completion of services, the government will retrieve the sailplane from the contractor facility in a similar manner to how it was delivered.  The contractor is not responsible for delivering the sailplane to a government facility.
CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
2.1	Laws and Regulations.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws that protect health and safety of employees and the community.  Furthermore, painting related services shall be done in accordance with all applicable regulations to include but not limited to 14 CFR parts 43 and 45.
2.2	Painter Experience.  Previous experience with painting gliders is considered highly desirable (minimum 2 aircraft).  If the contractor does not have experience painting gliders, prior experience with painting general aviation aircraft is considered adequate (minimum 3 years).  In either case, the contractor should have experienced staff available to recover fabric control surfaces if necessary.
2.3	Weight Requirements.  The aircraft is frequently operated close to its max certificated gross weight.  Any unnecessary addition of weight to the aircraft may render the aircraft incapable of fulfilling mission requirements.  Upon completion of painting services, the empty weight of the sailplane shall not be in excess of 720 Lbs.  This will ensure a useful load of greater than 400 Lbs for future operations.  Accurately weighing the aircraft after painting is the responsibility of the contractor.
2.4	Removal of Existing Paint. The contractor shall remove as much of the existing paint as possible prior to adding new paint on the sailplane.  It is preferred that the contractor remove all paint from metal surfaces via chemical or other means within the limitations of paragraph 2.1.  Though not a requirement, the contractor may choose to re-cover the fabric control surfaces rather than paint over the current fabric in order to reduce weight and remain within the requirements of paragraph 2.3.
2.5	Painting.  The contractor shall adhere to the following:
2.5.1	The contractor shall paint the aircraft to look like the VISTA aircraft flown by TPS.  This desired look is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 4 shows a simplistic drawing of what the glider may look like once painted in this scheme.  Note that Figure 4 is only a concept.  The contractor shall make all efforts to match their work to the paint scheme shown in Figure 3 with the following exceptions:
2.5.1.1	No corporate logos or names (i.e. Lockheed, General Electric, etc.) will be displayed.  However, USAF and TPS logos will be included.
2.5.1.2	The contractor is further responsible for ensuring the sailplane paint design includes all markings required by federal regulations prior to completion of the work.  Note that while the aircraft in Figure 3 does not have an N number, the glider should be painted with the number N268BA in place of the Air Force serial number.  The glider is further certified as an Experimental aircraft and must include the text ?EXPERIMENTAL? under the canopy rail in place of crew names.
2.5.1.3	The ?VISTA? label on the tail will be replaced by a larger TPS unit patch.  The small patch located on the longitudinal red stripe will be deleted.
2.5.2	The contractor shall use quality polyurethane or similar paint which is durable to both inclement weather and sunlight.  Methods of reducing weight gain are highly encouraged.  For example, the contractor should attempt to paint the top of the fuselage blue without laying down a white base coat underneath as is common practice.
2.6	Timeframe.  The contractor shall complete all work within three weeks (21 calendar days) of sailplane delivery to the contractor facility.  
2.7	Location of Contractor Facility.  It is desired that the Contractor facility shall be within easy transportation distance of Tehachapi, CA where the sailplane is currently located.  Under delivery option 1.3.1, this distance will be considered one hour of flight time on aerotow.  Under delivery option 1.3.2, this distance will be considered two hours of driving time.
Place of delivery, performance, and acceptance is FOB Destination, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a four and one half (4 ? ) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-03-D-0005 for husbanding services with Colombia in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional  husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR DEEP VACCUM CHAMBER.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers. 1.  What size mechanical roughing pump will be supplied by NASA Goddard?  Dry Mechanical Vacuum Pump:  We are in the process of procuring a dry roughing pump like:  Adixen Model ACP40  Or one similar that meets the following requirements:  1.    pumping speed, minimum of 20 CFM  2.    ultimate pressure, less than 50 x 10-2 torr  3.    operating voltage,100-230VAC, 50/60hz, single or three phase.  4.    Vacuum pump will have high reliability and require minimum routine maintenance.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  2.  External heating jacket:  a.  Is this a removable jacket?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Our preference is to have it removable.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  b.  Is the plan to install and remove this each time the chamber is cycled?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  We would most likely leave it installed on the chamber, unless we needed to access the chamber under the blanket.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  c.  If the temperature controls are not part of this specification, what are they, who supplies them and how are they installed?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  We will provide the controller, necessary instrumentation and  mounting in our control rack that is TBD. It would be too hard to try  to specify all of the details that we would be required at this  point. That said, the vendor is still responsible for the operation  of the heating jacket at their facility with their equipment to  verify that it works properly. The specification currently states: "The heating jacket will be able to uniformly heat the entire  external surfaces of the chamber including the doors and feedthroughs. The heating jacket will be sized to heat the chamber to a maximum of  120C in a minimum of four hours. The temperature controls are not  part of this specification. " We will ultimately provide all of the necessary equipment once the  chamber is in our labs. Controlling the heating jacket was not an  immediate need as it was driven by the ability to achieve ultra high  vacuum, which is a future requirement. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  3.  In order to achieve the ultra high vacuum requested, we will need to bake out the chamber prior to shipment, so we will need to operate the bakeout heating jacket.  What is the plan here?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Our preference is for them to test and operate the heating jacket, so they can use it to bake-out the chamber.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
