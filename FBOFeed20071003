<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to enter into a contract to support advanced development of new or improved influenza virus diagnostic laboratory test systems that meet U.S. regulatory requirements for use in U.S. clinical laboratories.  Products for influenza virus testing should have high sensitivity and specificity, along with reliability, capability for testing larger numbers of specimens with reduced tech time, reasonable cost, and flexibility to run single or multiple assays (to include assays for specific influenza A subtypes) on the same specimen and quickly adapt to testing for new pandemic virus candidates, or subtypes.
These tests should have capability to detect all influenza A viruses and differentiate novel from seasonal influenza viruses and other human respiratory viruses.  Proposals for multi-marker or individual assays, methods and platforms that may meet inter-pandemic and pandemic testing scenarios will be considered.  Besides meeting or exceeding the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity performance of currently used laboratory-based diagnostic tests (primarily viral culture and IFA/DFA), the laboratory influenza diagnostic test system is expected to enable an increased number of specimens that can be tested in medium and large hospital, academic hospital, and commercial laboratories with reduced hands-on time.  In addition, instrument purchase price, footprint and per assay costs are important considerations for practical use and implementation.  The final objective of this contract is to have a new or improved FDA approved laboratory diagnostic test system for use in U.S. clinical laboratories within 2-3 years that meets the criteria noted above.  The contractor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to achieve the above mentioned objectives.  Incremental funding for a cost-reimbursement type contract will be provided to support this effort.  A pre-proposal meeting/conference will be held prior to the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The date, time, and location for the preproposal meeting will be included in the solicitation.  RFP 2007-N-09247 will be available on or about June 1, 2007.  The solicitation can be accessed through the internet at: www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments issued to the solicitation will also be made available at the same website.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  This procurement will not be set-aside for small business.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency.  Any questions/concerns about the subject RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Jeff Miller at afx2@cdc.gov.

<DESC>General Information Contracting Office Address 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue S.E. Washington Navy Yard, DC This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.   General Description and Requirements The Advanced Development Office for Undersea Warfare (formerly Advanced Systems and Technology Office or ASTO) within the Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. is soliciting engineering services for advanced software and hardware technology improvements for ASW projects.  Services sought include, but are not limited to, development, design, test and analysis of hardware and software models and transitional systems in the areas listed below in paragraphs 1-5.  The Navy’s primary objective in this solicitation is to acquire engineering services to support development of advanced ASW technologies that can rapidly transition to fleet introduction via acquisition programs, and that significantly improve ASW capability while reducing Total Ownership Costs.  Some current projects under development are discussed within these paragraphs to provide examples of the kind of technology services being sought.  These discus!  sions are not intended to limit the scope of future technologies and services that are obtained under this solicitation.  1. Towed Arrays:  Current projects include a high gain Towed Array capability that can provide increased array gain, left-right ambiguity resolution, and improved operational availability compared to current submarine towed arrays; two physical implementations are being considered: a thin line twin-line (TLTL) array and a single-line Vector Sensor Towed Array (VSTA) that provides multi-line towed array performance in a single-line array (1.5 inch max OD).  Technology improvement areas include low-cost, high-reliability telemetry systems no larger than 0.5 inch OD; improved submarine array/ tow cable handling and stowage systems; and low-cost, low-frequency, low-noise vector sensors no larger than 0.75 inch OD.  Other high gain array concepts may be considered. 2. Hull Arrays: Current projects include Conformal Acoustic Velocity Sonar (CAVES) Large Vertical Array (LVA) technology that uses accelerometers to replace existing pressure sensor/telemetry technology resulting in detection gains over existing hull sonar and significant reduction to installation and life cycle costs, resulting in less impact on hull structure than existing Wide Aperture Arrays. Additionally, the sail mounted Low Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) is a large passive sonar intended for contact management that provides ~360 degree azimuth coverage when coupled with High Frequency (HF) sail array.  Technology improvement areas include acoustic sensing elements, which include but are not limited to: accelerometers, fiber optics, magnetics, and piezoelectric. Additional improvement in weight reduction, performance, reliability, and life cycle cost will be considered for array cables, connectors, inboard/outboard electronics, hull penetrators, array materials, and fabri!  cation/assembly tooling.  Also being pursued is technology that improves the installation of large arrays to ship’s hull in the areas of array/ship support structure and materials to reduce overall system life cycle cost.  3. Digital Acoustic Communications (D-ACOMMS): Current projects include ACOMMS which provides digital, underwater, bi-directional communications with improved voice, and adds text and image exchange via acoustic communications; and Comms at Speed and Depth which expands frequency coverage to other submerged platforms.  Technology improvement areas sought are support for 2-way acoustic/Radio Frequency (RF) buoys, encryption, information assurance, integration and testing on various surface and submerged platforms; and wireless secure connections from off-board sources.     4. Software/Signal Processing: Some current projects include the Advanced Processing Build (APB) Acoustic and Tactical projects that develop signal processing improvements to sonar and combat systems that transition via AN/BQQ-10 and AN/BYG-1, respectively under the Rapid COTS Insertion (RCI) business model; Shallow Water Array Processing (SWAP) program which is pursing the limits of passive array gain in shallow water environments; and Active Sonar Clutter Reduction which provides an active false alarm and clutter reduction for active sonars.  Through these and other similar programs the Navy continues to develop new technologies and improvements to existing technologies in signal processing, displays and controls, automated detection, localization and classification, and tactical planning and information/decision aid.  Supporting technologies and services include system design, system architecture, deep and shallow water mechanical systems engineering, software engineering!   and coding, software string and systems integration, environmental engineering and analyses, test planning, conduct and analysis, requirements analysis, risk and reliability analysis, interface design, modeling & simulation, cost & schedule estimating, Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), training and logistics planning.  5. Distributed Netted Systems (DNS): Current efforts in the area of DNS are seeking to develop distributed off-board surface, subsurface and bottomed active and passive sensor systems for shallow and deep water applications.  Rapidly deployable, expendable and hardened long duration sensor systems are under development.  Supporting technologies include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) Over The Horizon (OTH) communications, command and control (C2), data fusion, and Information Assurance (IA) for the integration of DNS into the Common Tactical and Operational Pictures.  Technology areas of interest include buoy designs for deep water moored and station keeping surface variants.   Sensor, processor and power system packaging into buoy and torpedo sized containers.  Deployment designs for DNS from various surface, subsurface and air tactical platforms.  Marine power generation to include traditional combustion engine, alternative power supply and advanced battery designs.  Lo!  w and medium data rate acoustic path and RF OTH communications for buoy and deep water moored applications.  Communication subsystems of interest include LPI communications, motion stabilized buoy antennas, data gateways, relays and modems. Technologies for low noise vector sensors, magnetic sensors, volumetric receive arrays and compact, high power and autonomous active transmitters are under consideration.  C4I areas of interest include sensor fusion techniques, data schemes and standards, and interfaces with emerging Navy C2 infrastructure.   BAA Scope The scope of this BAA is a 2 step process.   Step 1 is an invitation to submit White Papers describing technical approach, experience, capabilities and past performance with a cost estimate in the technology improvement areas listed in ‘General Description and Requirements’ above.  White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of the offeror in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the technical and operational feasibility of the concept.  Offerors submitting white papers may be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission, however, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award. Decisions regarding the invitation to submit a full proposal, however, will be based on the Navy’s assessment of the technical merit, reasonableness of transition to acquisition, relevance to Navy needs, and offeror’s overall qualifications.  However, any such invitation for submission of a full technical and cos!  t proposal does not guarantee an award.   Step 2 will be a request from the Government to the Offeror for Full Technical and Cost Proposals for a maximum of five (5) year period of performance to support the Navy in one or more of the technology improvement areas listed in ‘General Description and Requirements’ above.  This effort will include maturing the technology leading to laboratory and at-sea testing, and participating in technical/program reviews.   The planned schedule for this BAA is as follows: BAA will be open for a 1year period during which time White Papers may be submitted; Navy completes review of White Papers approximately 1 month after receipt; Offerors invited (as appropriate) to submit Full Technical and Cost Proposals 1 month after Navy notification of invitation to submit. ; Evaluations of proposals, including discussions, if needed, will be approximately 2  (2) months after Proposals received.  The type of contracts to be awarded are planned to be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) with Technical Instructions to be issued to guide the effort.  Travel, material and support costs will not be subject to any fee.  Contract periods of performance will include a base year with up to four (4) one-year options for a total performance period of up to five (5) years.  Since NAVSEA and its affiliated PEOs have funded related technology development under numerous programs, submittals that build on current or previous DoD work are encouraged.  However, if offerors are enhancing work performed under other DoD projects, they must clearly identify the point of departure and what existing work will be brought forward and what new work will be performed under this BAA.  Industry, academia, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, educational institutions, Historically Black Colleges and University and Minority Institutions are encouraged to participate.

<DESC>The Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Network Enterprise Domain (NED) intends to issue a sole source contract, under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, to Assurance Technology Corporation (ATC), 84 South Street, Carlisle, MA 01741.  The contract award is anticipated to be in late calendar year 2007.  The contract length is for no more than 5 years (1 base year and 4 one-year options).  The contract scope includes the maintenance, upgrades, and enhancements to the JTRS Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveform.  ATC developed the JTRS SINCGARS waveform under contract DAAB15-02-C-0037.  As a result of this experience, ATC is currently the only vendor capable of providing the follow-on support â€“ to seamlessly maintain, upgrade, and enhance the software.  It is the only vendor with the necessary expertise and experience to provide the required services without unacceptable delays and duplicative costs to the Government.  The JTRS SINCGARS waveform is a critical capability for the JTRS program.  Without seamless continuous support, the schedules of other JTRS domains will likely be significantly affected.  The Government intends to issue a request for proposal to ATC without further notice.  Any additional solicitation information will be available at the SPAWAR eCommerce Central website, at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  Interests or questions pertaining to this acquisition will be considered by the agency and they should be addressed to Ms. Kim Harvill, Contract Specialist, via email at kim.harvill@ navy.mil.

The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal/objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand.  Contractor provided administrative and clerical support services are required to support this mission.

Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  It is the Navy?s intention to consolidate these five existing contracts at into one contract.  These sites, and the existing contracts and contractors currently providing services are as follows: Training Air Wing One - NAS Meridian, MS ? contract N00140-05-P-0318, with Symtech, Springfield, VA.  Training Air Wing Two ? NAS Kingsville, TX, - contract N00140-05-M-0018 with Symtech, Springfield, VA.  Training Air Wing Four - NAS Corpus Christi, TX- N00140-05-P-0539, with Nitelines, Duluth, GA.

The Government intends to conduct a Total Small Business set aside competitive acquisition for these services, under the NAICS code of 561110.  Offerors will be required to submit a technical proposal, which is anticipated to be more important than the price proposal.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be a 5-year contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  It is intended to have the new contract in place for the commencement of services on 1 April 2008.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-08-0004 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-12. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 812930 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $6.5 million in average annual revenue. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The Contractor shall provide the U.S. EPA with 10 unreserved and two (2) reserved  parking spaces for U.S. EPA's Criminal Investigation Division (CID) agents for a twelve-month period. The 12 parking spaces shall be within a two-block radius from the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center located at 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20460. Parking for  these vehicles needs to be in close proximity of the CID office for quick departure for investigation of environmental crimes, gathering of evidence, and attendance at meetings at U.S. Attorneys' Offices and other Federal, State, and Local agencies. The parking spaces shall be covered as the law  enforcement vehicles have expensive law enforcement equipment installed. Having the vehicles out of sight reduces the risks of theft, which could cause extensive damage to the vehicle and the equipment. Access to the parking area is required at ALL TIMES (24 hours per day). ESTIMATED PERIOD OF  PERFORMANCE: The period of performance is for twelve months from the date of award. ESTIMATED VALUE: The estimated value of this procurement does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government will make award to the responsive, responsible  firm, whose quotation is most advantageous to the Government and represents the best value, based on location and proximity to the CID office, parking coverage, and price. The provision at FAR 52.212-1 "Instructions to Offerors-Commercial" applies to this acquisition. Offerors are to include a  completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 "Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items" with their response.

The aforementioned provisions  and clauses can be accessed electronically at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html. Prospective sources are reminded that award can only be made to a Contractor who is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) database with an active DUNS number. QUOTE SUBMISSION  INSTRUCTIONS: Offerors shall submit a firm-fixed-price quote priced on a monthly basis for the entire period of performance, inclusive of any taxes and fees, if applicable.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511120   The Environmental Protection Agency plans to issue a sole source purchase order to the American Academy of Pediatrics, Division of Scholarly Journals., for the publication of five peer-reviewed journals.  Due to the process of journal submission and acceptance to peer-reviewed journals, authors may only submit their article(s) to one journal.  Once the journal was submitted to American Academy of Pediatrics and was accepted, it became the only possible firm to publish the article.  The set of five articles was submitted to Pediatrics in June 2007, and  accepted for publication on September 5, 2007.  The journal, Pediatrics, was considered the best audience for the set of five articles by the co-authors for the following reasons: 	1) Target Audience: Pediatricians and scientists working on children's environmental health were our target audience  for articles on the subject of environmental factors and puberty timing.  Pediatrics has 65,000 subscribers, mainly pediatricians and scientists working in 	pediatric medicine.  Subscribers will receive a copy of the Supplement. 	2) Practicality: Few journals publish groups of articles or  Supplements, which was necessary for conveying the message (5 articles) from our workshop.   	3) Scientific Recognition and Prestige:  Pediatrics is one of the top journals in the field of pediatrics.  It is important that EPA sponsored products are recognized in the medical and scientific  community.  And the Supplement provides further visibility since the set of five articles is published as one issue of the journal. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A QUOTE (RFQ) AND NO SOLICATION IS AVAILABLE.     Responses to this announcement and questions must be in writing and submitted to the  Contracting Officer in writing.     Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a sole source Firm Fixed Price contract for the H-53 AWA system with Eclypse International Corporation.  This contract action will include the procurement of qualified production kits, spares and any associated non-recurring engineering. Description: The Automated Wiring Analysis (AWA) system is required to aid in identification, troubleshooting, and maintenance of wiring issues on the H-53 helicopter.  The H-53 AWA system will pinpoint wiring failures, such as chafing, arcs, and breaks to help maintainers find the fault quickly and accurately.  The system is a multi-point system-level automated wiring tester based upon the RTS-501 wiring test suite.  This equipment suite was previously validated for the H-53 through development efforts undergone in contract N00421-04-D-0089.  The RTS-501 wiring test suite offers the ability to quickly assess wiring systems, identify faults along the conductive path, and locate those faults within ?5% of the wiring length.  The system is intended for use at the H-53 organizational, intermediate, and depot levels of maintenance.  The test suite interfaces directly with H-53 aircraft wiring using interface test adapters (ITA) to connect with individual aircraft wiring harnesses.  The AWA system will significantly reduce the maintenance man-hours spent troubleshooting wiring issues and will help mitigate current safety issues associated with Kapton insulated wiring. Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) intends to replace multiple  stand alone legacy phone systems with a centralized enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system.  To accomplish this task, OTS will conduct market research to identify potential vendors capable of demonstrating a VoIP system within a three week time frame with one of the three weeks allowed for the installation.  The anticipated start date for the demonstration project will be the first week in November, 2007.  The demonstration will be conducted in the OTS Chicago Regional Office located at: 1 South Wacker Drive, Suite 2000, CHICAGO, IL  60606.

Interested parties must provide VoIP products that have been certified to run on a Cisco Systems network and the offeror must demonstrate recent successful experience running the product on a Cisco Systems  enterprise network.  Prospective offerors interested in participating in this market research project will not receive payment from the OTS and must be aware that participation in the project will not guarantee any future business should the OTS proceed with this initiative.  The market research participants will be responsible for installing the proposed product, training five (5) users in the Chicago Regional Office, providing technical support to the OTS Chicago Regional Office users and to the program manager located in OTS Headquarters.  Should OTS decide to conduct a competitive requirement based on the results of the market research, a request for proposals will be issued to only those participants in the market research.  Any resulting contract awarded will be based upon Best Value Methodology including past performance.  Questions must be submitted to Isabel.RomanCogswell@ots.treas.gov by 2:00 PM (EST), October 10, 2007.  Telephonic questions will not be answered.  Interested parties must submit sufficient technical information for OTS to make a determination that the proposed VoIP product successfully runs on a Cisco Systems  network.  The technical information must be submitted directly to Illona M.Williams at Illona.Williams@ots.treas.gov. no later than 2:00 PM (EST) October 17, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Natick Contracting Division, has a requirement for Parachutist Oxygen Mask.  This requirement is the response to a capability gap identified for a parachutist oxygen mask as part of the O xygen Life Support equipment used by Military Free Fall (MFF) parachutists.  The POM will provide the MFF parachutist with a dependable means to receive supplemental oxygen during MFF operations above 12,999 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL).  The POM shall be a Com mercial off the Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI).  The POM shall  be compatible both with the American Safety Flight System (ASFS) and Parachutist High Altitude Oxygen System (PHAOS).    The Government anticipates awarding a Requirements contract for a base ordering period to cover Developmental and Operational Testing a nd 4 Optional Order Periods for production quantities.  Offerors within the competitive range may be issued a purchase order to deliver items for a User Assessment Phase.  During User Assessment, items will undergo evaluation by Army users for fit, form an d function and be subjected to ground and airdrop testing in operational environments. Performance requirements shall be as followed: a. Must provide sufficient oxygen to maintain a partial pressure of oxygen equivalent to that present at a maximum of 5,000-ft above ground level (AGL) over all operational altitudes. b. Must be secured to the parachutists face during movement on board, aircraft exit, high speed free fall, parachute opening, descent and landing. c. Must be operable to 30,000 ft pressure altitude. d. Must be physically and functionally compatible with ASFS and PHAOS bailout and oxygen storage systems. e. Must be compatible with the current L and T bayonet connectors used on Protec, Advanced Combat, Gentex Aviator and PM High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) helmets. f. Must allow for a side mounted hose connection and allow the routing of the oxygen hose between the parachutists back and rigged harness/container and/or over the shoulder. g. Must not degrade the parachutists view and shall not interfere with the parachutists ability to exit, free-fall, deploy his parachute and conduct emergency procedures, canopy flight, equipment lowering or parachutist landing. h. Must operate at temperatures ranging from -45 deg F to 160 deg F and humidity ranging from 0 to 100% non-condensing.   i. Must meet applicable requirements of Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC) Air Standard 61/101/11 (minimum standards for parachutists breathing equipment) between 13,000 and 25,000 ft pressure.  j. Must include a dynamic microphone in accordance with MIL-PRF-26542, Type M-169A-AIC. k. Must remain operable in a predominantly sand and dust environment. l. Frost or ice accumulation inside or outside of the mask must not preclude proper operation of the mask. m. Must provide an anti-suffocation valve. n. Provision must be made to allow mask to fit 98% of male/female parachutists as defined by MIL-STD 1472, Department of Defense Design Criteria Standard, Human Engineering.  If a size range of inner (soft) facemasks is used, then there should be no more t han 4 sizes.  o. Hoses must not be able to be collapsed or kinked in a manner to decrease the oxygen supply to the jumper. p. Must remain operable for at least 20 jumps over a period of up to 180 days before requiring unit maintenance. Except for complete rebuilds, POM shall be capable of being maintained at unit level and require no more than two man hours per mask assembly. Detailed performance specifications will be provided with the Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP will be posted on the Natick Contracting Divisions web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil on approximately 2 November 2007.  This acquisition will  be Full and Open Competition.

<DESC>The correct solicitation number for this action is W58RGZ-08-R-0032.  Because this action is an integrated services and supplies requirement, separate synopses are required in both the services and supply arenas. The initial synopsis was published fo r the services arena under service class action code R. This action is to re-submit the synopsis for publishing in the supply arena. The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command propose an extension Not-to-Exceed six months under the existing Sikorsky/CCAD partnership contract DAAH23-03-D-0043.  The extension will include both supplies and technical/engineering/logistical support services  (TELSS) to support Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) in the repair and recapitalization of the H-60 Aircraft.  This is a fully integrated effort that involves the procurement of combined integrated services and supplies to support CCAD in meeting a require d 50 percent reduction in repair turn around time (RTAT).  The contractor must be able to provide the full range of services and 100% of material in order to meet the Governments requirement.  The contractor will provide technology insertion, obsolescence  management and test and support of equipment upgrades in support of reliability improvements for H-60 Aircraft.  The contractor will advise CCAD in establishing commercial best practices in the areas of production planning, production control, material ma nagement and process engineering.  This effort also requires that the contractor develop repair, recap, and structural workstation kits and provide logistical support function in the inventory management of the parts and the material required by CCAD in th e repair of the H-60 Aircraft in order to streamline CCAD component production and achieve a 50% reduction in repair turn around time.  The logistic support functions include supplying 100% of the parts required for CCAD to repair H-60 Aircraft.  Complete and adequate data is not available to support full and open competition.  This effort is a continuation of the existing sole source contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06615, who alone has the background design knowle dge experience, data, and/or equipment to support technical, engineering, material, and modernization capability required for this effort.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors are encouraged to contact Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Ms. Shelia Harris 203-386-3387) for subcontracting opportunities on this effort.  Government POC for this effort is Tracey McGraw (256)842-7630.  See numbered note(s) 22 and 26.

<SOLNBR>07CRRC0001
<ARCHDATE>09272008
<CONTACT>SHIRLEEN STEPHENS CHIEF, AOB 7036487477     sstephen@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This announcement is an update to the announcement appearing on March 13, 2007.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maintains the Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) in Sioux Falls, SD.  EROS was established to monitor and model land surface changes worldwide and does so by collecting, archiving and distributing many types of remotely sensed film and digital earth science data and investigating ways to use the data in scientific and land resource planning and management.  The USGS maintains the world's largest collection of space and aircraft acquired imagery of the Earth at EROS, including over four million images acquired by Landsat and other civilian satellites and over eight million aerial photographs. The USGS has determined that the requirement for technical support services, previously announced as a single procurement, will be divided into (1) a Landsat Data Continuity Contract (LDCC) and (2) a Technical Support Services Contract (TSSC).  The LDCC will support the USGS portion of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), a partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the USGS.  NASA has lead responsibility for mission definition, launch, and on-orbit checkout.  NASA will provide the satellite, sensor and launch services (launch vehicle).  NASA is also procuring the mission operations element of the ground system as a deliverable to USGS.  The USGS, with principal support from the LDCC, will provide the balance of the development for the flight systems (acquisition planning), and the remainder of the ground system (data capture, archiving, calibration/validation, product generation and data access) development.  The estimated period of performance is a base year (approximately 12 months, based on award date) and four option years.  Competition is full and open.  Note:  The USGS will continue to pursue a flight operations support contract separate from the LDCC.  The TSSC will provide principal support to the balance of EROS mission responsibilities, to include a broad range of activities in management of global earth observations data, including the development, operation and management of advanced systems for archiving, processing, distributing, and applying land related earth science, mapping, and other geographic data and information.  The estimated period of performance is a base year (approximately 12 months, based on award date) and four option years.  Competition is full and open.  All contractors are encouraged to routinely visit the EROS solicitation website at http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/acq_opp/EROS_index.html and e-mail any questions to eros_aquisition@usgs.gov.  Additional notices will appear prior to solicitation releases and details on a site visit and proposal conference are to be determined.

<DESC>Location of Work:  Most incidents occur within the coastal regions of the U.S. and its territories, but international travel has occurred in the past.  The contractor shall have the ability to respond to international incidents if required.

NOTICE:     THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.
The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the business size and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  All firms qualified, capable, and interested, without restriction to size standards, should submit the requested information.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified business concerns able to will provide technical and scientific support to NOAA, Office of Response & Restoration (ORR) on an as-needed basis.  There are four major tasks required in the proposed contract:  A) Incident Response & Incident Response Preparation, B) Training, C) Research and Development, and D) Analytical and Laboratory Support.  

The proposed Contractor shall provide support on both an emergency and non-emergency time frame.  A higher percentage of effort will be for non-time critical support, but the ability of the contractor to respond quickly during an emergency event is critical to ORR?s mission and paramount to the fulfillment of the contractor?s obligations.  The focus of the technical and scientific support is chemistry related issues during hazardous material and petroleum spills, but ORR may support all hazards missions such as disaster responses and port security contingency planning issues that involve chemical risks.  The contractor shall provide augmented support to ORR staff scientist and Scientific Support Coordinators.

Task A ? Perform 24-hr., 7 days a week (24/7) spill response.  Must respond to calls from ORR within one-hour of the initial contact and be able to provide support directly by verbal consultation or have access to the resources required to investigate the request and provide follow-up communications both verbally and in writing.   Provide oral and written reports as required, reflecting information or specific support requested.  A common request will be a concise assessment of the hazards associated with the spilled chemical, the transport and fate of the chemical relative to the specific incident environment, and any unique or scenario-specific concerns.  Such reports are generally defined as Chemical Hazard Assessments rather than risk assessment since they identify threats rather than probability.   Other emergency requests might include recommendations for sampling or a review of proposed sampling and/or analytical protocols, or to recommend or review mitigation techniques.  The general protocol for such support is to provide an initial oral report or discussion that is followed by written documentation (a report) that is electronically submitted a couple of hours later.   The proposed contract will also be required to perform On-Scene Response Support, requiring travel to the site of the incident to provide direct consultation and technical/scientific support to federal response personnel and cleanup personnel on issues related to chemistry.  In addition to direct consultation, field support activities may include field monitoring, sampling, and assessments.  If the situation requires and a request is made, the contractor must be in route to the site of the emergency within 24-hours of request.  Most incidents occur within the coastal regions of the U.S. and its territories, but international travel has occurred in the past.  The contractor shall maintain the ability to respond internationally if requested.  The contractor shall contribute to spill preparedness activities including drills and the production of spill response planning documents such as Area Contingency Plans as requested.  The contractor?s role shall include the assessment of the hazards associated with chemicals that might be released into the environment.

Task B - The proposed contractor shall develop training materials and conduct training and workshops as requested.  Training may be requested as part of planned activities across the U.S. and its territories or at the contractor?s base of operations.  On rare occasions, a workshop or training activity will require travel outside of the U.S.

Task C - The proposed contractor shall provide technical support in the area of chemistry as required to support ORR in its mission critical activities.  This may require the contractor to develop, manage, and perform research projects, as well as contribute to the projects managed by ORR personnel.  The following represents possible assignments: design and conduct experiments and field test to further the scientific knowledge of the chemical hazards in the environment; development of measurement technologies to detect and quantify dispersed oil; evaluate alternative spill response countermeasures such as solidifying agents.  Results from these efforts shall be documented in written reports and publications, and may influence ORR response and restoration strategies.

Task D - The proposed contractor shall provide analytical support for the analysis of environmental samples contaminated with petroleum and/or petroleum products to determine the relevant physical characteristics, short-term fate, and apparent toxicity of the oil based on the relative distribution of PAH.  Analytical support may extend into the identification of other chemical pollutants or unknowns, but will not extend to the analysis of any known highly dangerous samples that would be outside the scope of work for a typical commercial laboratory. The proposed contractor must be able to assess the quality of the data from the chemical analyses provided and interpret the results in terms of its implications to operational decisions.  Emergency response may require time-critical analytical support for a limited number of samples and may require completion of the requested analyses and preliminary reporting within 24 hours of sample receipt.  Non-emergency analytical support that is associated with ORR research activities and natural resource damage assessment surveys will have task-defined schedules.  Environmental samples may include water, sediments, and animal tissues.  Routinely requested laboratory support functions are as follows:  
-Chemical characterization and compositional analysis of reference oils and spilled oil samples by GC/MS.  Compositional analysis would include the quantification of selected alkanes and PAHs common to oil and typically monitored during oil spill events.
-The proposed contractor must understand oil chemistry and posses the ability to interpret analytical data such that a fingerprint determination between an unknown and reference to determine if they are derived from a common source.
-The laboratory support element must include the ability at assess key physical property data such as density and viscosity of reference and spilled oil samples.
-Assess a spilled oil?s applicability to the application of chemical dispersants. 

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price, labor hour or time-and-material task order IDIQ type contract will be for the eventual solicitation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 M.   All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<ARCHDATE>06282008
<CONTACT>Roberta Hatch, 937-904-6692
<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate – level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.  In order to assist respondents with replying to this  sources sought synopsis a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:  Firms responding to this announcement  should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small  disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small  business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>The Naval Air Engineering Station, (NAES) Lakehurst, NJ has a current need to provide high quality water to operate its high-pressure steam plant for its test operation.  Water from wells are treated by adding sodium hydroxide to increase pH, is aerated and then passed through sand filters.  Following this process, ion exchange is employed to obtain the water quality needed for boiler use.  Regeneration of the ion exchange media is required periodically at the steam plant.  Large quantities of sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid is discharged to a neutralization basin, treated and then discharged to the stations sanitary sewer system.  
Capacity:  De-ionized water is presently available at a rate of 220 gallons per minute using the ion exchange columns at the facility.  Maximum monthly usage was approx 6,000,000 gallons.  Average Monthly usage is approx. 1,750,000 gallons.  Lowest usage has been less than 175,000 gallons.  

Requirements:  Contractor will be able to provide a mobile demineralizer capable of providing the desired quality of demineralized water at a rate of 220 gallons per minute using wells as a source of water.  The mobile unit will be capable of demineralizing a minimum of 600,000 gallons of water before maintenance/regeneration of the unit is required.  The Contractor will be responsible for connecting the mobile unit to the steam plant.  Unless the mobile unit is less than 8 x 16, the mobile unit shall be positioned outside the steam plant.  Maintenance must be conducted off-site.  No hazardous chemicals will be allowed at NAES as part of the demineralization process.  No discharges will be allowed from the demineralizer except for the demineralized water and small quantities of rinse water.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking small businesses with the capability to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC) for a new nine-year multicenter clinical trial, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).  SPRINT is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial testing the effects of intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Approximately 7,500 participants will be randomized into either the lower SPB goal of <120 mmHg (intensive treatment group) or the standard SPB goal of <140 mmHg (control group).  Participants will be 55 years or older with SPB >130 mmHg and at least one additional CVD risk factor.  Only two high risk groups will be excluded.  Those patients with diabetes and those who have had a stroke because they are the target groups of other ongoing NHLBI and NINDS trials that are testing a lower BP goal.  SPRINT will focus on three other high risk groups:  patients with clinical CVD other than stroke, patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients without clinical CVD who have other CVD risk factors such as low levels of HDL.  In SPRINT, there will be a subgroup of 3,500 people with stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2).  The primary composite endpoints will be CVD mortality and non-fatal MI, stroke, and heart failure.  Several secondary outcomes will be examined, such as markers of renal functioning in non-CKD participants, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.  It is possible that the study may be expanded to include additional secondary clinical endpoints, or additional treatment strategies to achieve the standard and lower SBP treatment goals.

There will be a one year protocol development phase, followed by the recruitment of participants over a 2 year period.  Participants will be followed for a total of four to six years.  Post follow-up there will be a two year period for close out, analysis, reporting, and dissemination.  Data to be collected includes demographics, medical history, physical examinations, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs), as well as psychosocial, economic, and lifestyle questionnaires and data.  SPRINT will include 4 to 6 Clinical Center Network (CCN) hubs, with approximately 30-45 clinical sites per hub, which will be solicited under a separate request for proposals (RFP).  Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants.  In addition, it is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT:  a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed.  The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Coordinating Center will: 

1)	be responsible for the statistical design of the study and provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for randomizing study subjects, for study monitoring, and for the management and analysis of study data;
2)	develop operational and analytical methodology; provide administrative guidance, oversight, and support for SPRINT as a whole;
3)	coordinate protocol writing activities, including protocol drafting and finalization; develop, design, and distribute study forms and a manual of operations; ensure that the provisions of the manual of operations are carried out by the CCNs and the clinical sites; 
4)	establish the Drug Distribution Center (DDC) and two core laboratories:  the Central Laboratory and the ECG Reading Center; the DDC will package, label, and dispense drugs according to the study protocol and will also monitor compliance and provide data to the CC for further analyses; the Central Laboratory will arrange for the analysis of blood and urinary measurements, provide interpretation of blood measurements, and collect and store blood samples for biomarker and DNA analysis; the ECG Reading Center will provide a central interpretation laboratory of resting ECG; core laboratories will be responsible for developing and distributing specific measurement procedures, timely data gathering, analysis under the leadership from the CC, and providing data to the CC for central analyses;
5)	maintain quality control at participating Clinical Center Networks (CCN), and monitor their performance status; promote interactions among the CCNs, coordinating study activities among the CCNs and core laboratories, and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; train CCNs and core laboratories in standardized protocol implementation and data collection; provide rapid feedback to the CCNs and core laboratories on the quality of data submitted and proposed corrections; conduct periodic visits to each CCN in order to monitor and assure high performance throughout the trial;
6)	make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair and to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 
7)	coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the DSMB and other meetings related to the conduct of the overall trial;
8)	facilitate communications among all organizational study components during each phase of the trial, including the Protocol Review Committee (PRC), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and trial-wide subcommittees, such as the ancillary/substudy, mortality/morbidity, operational, publications, and adherence subcommittees; prepare and distribute minutes and reports of the Steering Committee, Executive Committee, PRC, and DSMB meetings, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data collection and report content;
9)	establish and maintain a computer system, secure database, and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data (including blood samples and ECGs) collected from up to 120-180 separate clinical sites; also provide for the central interpretation of quality of life and costs data collected on subsamples of participants;
10)	develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of SPRINT information, documents, and forms to the CCNs; develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about SPRINT for the lay public;
11)	prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating CCNs, the project officer, the contracting officer, and others identified as key partners by the project officer;
12)	review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy, addressing such issues as recruitment progress and certification of new clinical sites;
13)	monitor end point results, morbidity and mortality data, and adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study; and
14)	design and implement a plan for study closeout, analysis, and dissemination, including final data collection, verification, analytical support for scientific writing groups,  publication of study results, and plans for the investigators?? dissemination of study results. 

The CC will frequently need to make complex and rapid decisions and assist the study leadership and the DSMB in their decision-making process. These decisions will often be based on medical information obtained from the clinics and developments in the scientific literature and other sources of information, such as the FDA.  Therefore, CC staff will need to be highly experienced, with strong medical and scientific qualifications and credibility, and have specialized experience relating to hypertension, clinical cardiology, and nephrology.  The CC must have biostatistical and information technology expertise, including the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, economic, and medical morbidity and mortality data, and to develop and maintain a complex website and computer system.  CC staff must be experienced coordinating several long term, complex, large scale, multi-site clinical events trials lasting more than four years.  This experience should include managing subcontracts with a DDC or core laboratories.  The medical monitor for the CC should be board certified in internal medicine with substantial experience in the clinical management of hypertension, and have significant experience in large scale multi-site events clinical research trials.  The CC must develop highly productive working relationships with the CCNs, core laboratories, academic researchers, NHLBI Project Office, advisory groups (e.g., DSMB), and clinical sites.

It is anticipated that there will be approximately 4-6 CCN hubs with approximately 30-45 clinical sites per hub.  Clinical sites will be medical facilities or individual practices that will be involved in the evaluation, enrollment, and treatment of patients in the trial.  In addition, SPRINT will include a central Coordinating Center (CC) that will be solicited under a separate request for proposals (RFP).  Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants.  It is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT:  a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

Each CCN will be responsible for timely recruitment and clinical care quality assurance activities in accordance with the SPRINT protocol.  Each CCN will develop an appropriate subcontract arrangement with each clinical site; it is anticipated that the trial will use a per capitation reimbursement model for all or nearly all of the clinical sites in the study.  In addition, the CCN will provide the networks' scientific leadership and operational management.  The clinical sites within the CCN will collect data at the local level in accordance with the study protocol and the manual of operations (MOP), and will coordinate each participant's hypertension treatment.

Each CCN will be responsible for recruiting a minimum of between 1,250 to 1,875  patients, including meeting study-wide goals for recruitment of women and specific minorities (African Americans, Hispanic, Native American, Asian), and for study-wide goals with regard to patients with cardiovascular disease and stage 3 CKD.  The CCN will have the primary responsibility for timely evaluation and correction of recruitment problems, including development and implementation of alternative strategies to achieve the stipulated goals, and funding the related activities.  It is anticipated that each CCN will conduct at least yearly site visits within its network of clinical sites to supervise recruitment activities and assure high quality performance. The CCN activities will be coordinated with the CC, and may include site visits conducted by the CC, along with other organizational components of the study, leading to certification of new sites, cessation of recruitment at existing sites, and appropriate follow-up of patients enrolled from sites whose recruitment is stopped.  Each CCN will closely collaborate with and assist the CC in implementation and standardization of the protocol within their network.  

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed.  The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Clinical Center Network will: 

1.	propose and present to the Steering Committee a step treatment drug regimen for the blood pressure strategy and for background therapy (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic); collaborate with other CCNs, the Coordinating Center (CC), other central units (DDC, core laboratories), and the Project Office in finalizing the protocol and the manual of procedures (MOP), which includes detailed intervention and measurement descriptions and staff training procedures;
2.	have or develop a communication system within the CCN, including Internet capability; this system should include means of assisting the CC in facilitating data gathering links between the CCN and central units;

In an effort to enhance opportunities for SDVOSB and VOSB under Public Law 109-461 and increase the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplishments in this important socioeconomic category, VA's National Cemetery Administration is performing preliminary market research to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of SDVOSB and VOSB with regards to an upcoming acquisition for Conference Services in the New Orleans, LA; Indianapolis, IN; Atlanta, GA or Pittsburgh, PA areas.     The VA is mandated to give first preference to SDVOSB, VOSB, 8a and Hub Zone Businesses in that order of priority.  The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for SDVOSB or VOSBs, pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Public Law  109-461, as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.14. NAICS code for this acquisition is 721110.     The Size Standard is $6.5 Million.     The magnitude of this project is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.

(3) Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.?     If so, please provide the specifics.

<DESC>Scope of Work-

"Post Processing and Interpretation of Side Scan Sonar Images from Massachusetts"

October 3, 2007.


  In 2006, US EPA Region 1 scientists collected side scan sonar images from the Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site and the Industrial Waste Site off coastal Massachusetts in about 300 feet of water using the Klein 3000 dual frequency digital side scan sonar. Transects were performed in three overlapping areas to identify and locate historically disposed waste containers and other targets identified in previous studies. The US Army Corps of Engineers New England District and EPA Region I are currently evaluating whether unconsolidated dredged material generated by the Boston Harbor navigation improvement project can be used to cap several of the historically disposed waste container fields at the site. The information produced by this contract will be used to determine the locations and spatial extent of historic waste containers proposed for capping and will be included in the environmental assessments of the dredging project. We seek a contractor who can: interpret the images and classify targets with a certain level of confidence into man-made and natural feature categories; provide locations of all targets, and an estimate of the error for the locations; and create three separate georeferenced mosaics of the seabottom compatible with ArcMap 9.  The EPA intends to set the effort aside for small businesses.  If you are interested in competing for this work please contact Corey Ashe (617) 918-1128 or ashe.corey@epa.gov  by 4 PM October 12, 2007.

<DESC>Under the general direction of LAC/CAR's Office Director, and in coordination with USAID/Haiti's Senior Management Team, the incumbent will support the design and implementation of the Agency's Haiti Program and international cooperation efforts, and with the LAC/CAR's Senior Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of Haiti, will play a critical role in the Interagency Process.  Given the complexity of the Inter-agency effort, and the urgency for effective resource expenditure, incumbent will assist in the budget planning, resource coordination and the monitoring and oversight of program funds, including the resolution of audit issues and important constraints affecting program performance and impact.  Other duties and responsibilities include:  program planning to ensure implementation of these efforts in a timely and prudent manner; program analysis and approval so that the USG programs in support of this effort move to obligation; and senior lead/program coordination between the field, LAC/Washington and other components of the Inter-agency group.  

The work includes technical analysis, particularly economic policy review, country strategy formulation, project proposal analysis, and program implementation review.  Programs are highly and politically sensitive, and require public and Congressional correspondence and communication that demands discretion and care in distinguishing plans from programs and in assessing the degree of political or security sensitivity of issues.  The necessary analytical role requires full awareness of political complexities in Haiti and changing host country economic circumstances in which the efficient use of resources remains under continual review.  Tasks often require departing from past approaches and dealing with unstructured circumstances.  Task objectives may depend on an assessment of competing demands.  Sound judgment is needed concerning appropriate advice for Bureau management.  The myriad pressures for access to the program and to decision-makers involved with the program create an unusual combination of technical, administrative, and policy issues at all times.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the following procurement: Provide facilities planning, cost estimating, and project scheduling expertise at GSFC. Planning expertise translates information about facilities quality, quantity, and configuration into solutions, often including design and construction projects but sometimes operational or maintenance changes, and justification of needs in an environment of severely restricted resources.  Strategic, conceptual, and parametric cost estimating involves support to planners, project managers, and Division leadership in developing competitive alternatives for accomplishing major capital projects, as well as parametric estimating tool development and refinement.	Routine estimation services provide cost estimating support to planners and project managers in developing cost estimates for work requests (projects proposed for funding at under $500K each) and routine capital investment projects (usually under $5M each).  Schedulers capture complex information about the steps to be taken to achieve an objective, documenting the interdependency relationships among them to ensure that requirements can be implemented within the available resources. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service if required.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Companies interested in and capable of performing the above referenced work may respond to this announcement.  Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; NAICS Code related to relevant work;	whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; list of customers  that relevant work was provided covering the past five years (highlight contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions and Procurement related questions should be directed to:  Nylsevalis Ortiz-Collazo Nylsevalis.Ortizcollazo-1@nasa.gov Questions will only be answered via e-mail.

This request for comments does not commit the Government to any particular course of action nor is this draft PBSOW a solicitation for charter services at this time.  Please address the following questions:  

1.   For fiscal year 2005, the Federal Government spent $3 billion on Federal Sales for NAICS codes 481211, 481212 and 481219.  It is, however, unable to guarantee specific volumes to any specific service provider.  The Federal Government is interested in obtaining quality charter services from providers that can deliver quality services.  What would you recommend the Government do to make any solicitation for charter services attractive to bid on given the inability to guarantee specific volumes to any specific provider?

2.  Please identify your company name, point of contact, telephone number, mailing address, email address, and provide a brief summary of the charter services you provide.

3.  Please identify what type of company you are (e.g., broker, operator, etc.).

4.  The Federal Government uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code to determine a company?s business size.  The NAICS code for charters include NAICS codes 481211, 481212 and 481219.  NAICS information can be found at http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics02/.  Based on the NAICS code appropriate to your business, are you classified as a small business or large business?

5.  What types of charter services do you provide?  Please define and describe in detail.

6.  On average, how many aircraft do you have available and where are they located (e.g., domestic, international, major metropolitan areas, downtown areas, suburbs, rural, etc.)?  
7.  How are charter services priced for your company (e.g., discount off the list price, per hour, etc.) for corporate and Government clients?  Are these rates published and if so, where?

8.  How are negotiated contract rates communicated to the service provider and travel industry providers (e.g., travel agents, automated booking systems, etc.)?

9.  Are negotiated contract rates loaded into Global Distribution Systems (GDS)?  If so, which one(s)?

10.  Are there any safety considerations that should be included?

11.  Are negotiated rates commissionable?

12.  What types and/or ranges of discounts do you typically offer clients?  Compare discounts to commercial, corporate and Government clients and explain any differences in selling terms/conditions.  Provide a typical sample agreement.

13.  What drives changes to negotiated contract rates and how often do they change?

14.  What fees, if any, are associated with date changes and/or cancellations of the services?

15.  What data, if any, is collected on charter spend for the corporate and Government client?  Please list the data elements captured and reported on and their intended purpose/use.  

16.  The Federal Government contracts for a travel card program with commercial providers (e.g., Mastercard and Visa), and its account numbering sequences are unique to the Federal Government.  How would your company use the numbering sequence to ensure that the proper negotiated contract rates are displayed and charged?

17.  If a Federal agency negotiates a further reduced contract rate for their employees, how would such a rate be displayed, communicated and subsequently applied?

18.  What is the yearly dollar volume of your Federal Government business, if any?  Is the volume concentrated in any one area?

19.  What information do you need from a potential client in order to prepare a bid for providing charter services?

20.  What other information would be important for the Government to understand?

<DESC>Introduction:

The 687th Armament Systems Squadron (ARSS) at Eglin AFB, FL anticipates acquiring residual laser weapon system hardware from the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program.  The 687th ARSS is interested in sources that have the capability to effectively and efficiently maintain and operate the residual ACTD hardware to support an Extended User Evaluation of the system during FY08-10.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort is 541710; size standard 1000 employees. No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.    

Background:

The Boeing Company, under contract with US Special Operations Command, has developed a prototype airborne tactical laser weapon system based on a chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL) coupled to a turret-mounted beam control system.  The system is installed in a NC-130/H test aircraft, and will become residual hardware at the conclusion of the ACTD in February 2008.  The Air Force desires to conduct an Extended User Evaluation (EUE) of the prototype system to evaluate operational effectiveness against an extended target set; conduct aircrew familiarization training; and participate in flagged exercises, all of which will support decisions regarding further development.

The primary task of the effort is to maintain the hardware in a condition capable of providing the required fluence of laser energy on a ground-based aimpoint from the airborne platform.  An additional task is to recommend system performance improvements and implement changes if approved.  The anticipated rate of usage of the system is approximately 6 flights per year for the high power system and an additional 6-12 flights per year operating only the optical control system.  Given the limited number of high-power tests, reliable operation of the system during flight tests is imperative.  

Major hardware components include a chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL) with a sealed exhaust system, a beam control system coupled to a turret with a 50-cm aperture, and a 2-man fire control station.  The COIL employs a jet oxygen generator which is designed to be used without diluent gas.  Iodine is injected into the oxygen flow via a 2-D bank nozzle mixed with a small amount of nitrogen diluent.  A separate flow of heated nitrogen is injected supersonically on both sides of the iodine/nitrogen flow which accelerates the overall mixed flow to approximately Mach 3.5.  Power extraction is accomplished by a low magnification unstable resonator.  The effluent is removed from the cavity by adsorption in finely divided carbon maintained near 77K.  Liquid basic hydrogen peroxide (BHP) flows from a pressurized supply to a low pressure receiving tank and must be cooled and transferred back to the supply between laser firings.  

    
Responses:

Responses should describe in detail the vendor?s experience and expertise in operating high-power chemical oxygen-iodine lasers, including alignment and operation of unstable resonators.  Experience and expertise in operation, maintenance, and repair of an optical beam control system is also required.  Response should describe the vendors capability to assess overall system performance, recommend cost effective performance improvements, and execute resulting hardware/software modifications.  Experience with airborne systems is highly desired.

Firms responding to this notice should provide a capabilities package which also indicates their business size in accordance with the size standard, company name, address, a point of contact and Federal CAGE Code. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  Do not provide a standard company brochure, but a package which indicates experience and capabilities specific to the requirements identified in this notice. Potential teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be identified and responsibilities delineated.  Responses are limited to 12 pages in length and must be received by November 1,2007.  Technical questions should be addressed to Dr. Charlie Helms, 850-883-3215. Contractual questions should be addressed to Capt Lance Hannan at 850-882-0185.  Email your capabilities package to lance.hannan@eglin.af.mil. 

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting point of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Brig Gen Michael N. Wilson, AAC/CR.  Alternate Ombudsmen is Col Brian D. Buell, AAC/CS.  Contact information for both is 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495; 850-882-0662. See Numbered Notes 25 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Air Engineering Station, (NAES) Lakehurst, NJ has a current need to provide high quality water to operate its high-pressure steam plant for its test operation.  Water from wells are treated by adding sodium hydroxide to increase pH, is aerated and then passed through sand filters.  Following this process, ion exchange is employed to obtain the water quality needed for boiler use.  Regeneration of the ion exchange media is required periodically at the steam plant.  Large quantities of sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid is discharged to a neutralization basin, treated and then discharged to the stations sanitary sewer system.  
Capacity:  De-ionized water is presently available at a rate of 220 gallons per minute using the ion exchange columns at the facility.  Maximum monthly usage was approx 6,000,000 gallons.  Average Monthly usage is approx. 1,750,000 gallons.  Lowest usage has been less than 175,000 gallons.  

Requirements:  Contractor will be able to provide a mobile demineralizer capable of providing the desired quality of demineralized water at a rate of 220 gallons per minute using wells as a source of water.  The mobile unit will be capable of demineralizing a minimum of 600,000 gallons of water before maintenance/regeneration of the unit is required.  The Contractor will be responsible for connecting the mobile unit to the steam plant.  Unless the mobile unit is less than 8 x 16, the mobile unit shall be positioned outside the steam plant.  Maintenance must be conducted off-site.  No hazardous chemicals will be allowed at NAES as part of the demineralization process.  No discharges will be allowed from the demineralizer except for the demineralized water and small quantities of rinse water.  

For Further information and specifics such as current inlet water quality and outlet requirements contrat:  Mr. Walter Reed at 732-323-2371

<DESC>In accordance with the Revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular 
A-76, the FDA Office of Acquisition and Grants Services (OAGS) is publicly announcing the start of a streamlined competition for administrative support activities in the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) in the Headquarters, Northeast, and Central regions.  The Pacific, Southeast, and Southwest Regions will each have their own study.   Examples of activities include support to regulatory information, program, historian liaison, administration, investigation, supplies, and Custom House.  The work is conducted at over 20 different locations in the United States and Puerto Rico.  This study is projected to involve the following current FTE:  HQ/NE/CEN (36 FTE).  The Competitive Sourcing Official is Joe Ellis, the Agency Tender Official is Michael Roosevelt, the Contracting Officers is Kenneth Bell, Source Selection Authority is Kimberly Holden, and the Human Resources Advisor is Lenora Adams.  ORA will be developing a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) for each of the studies using streamlined methodology.  Prospective service providers are advised that a solicitation will be issued if the estimated cost of contractor performance is less than the cost of agency performance.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Inpatient and Outpatient Care of Inmates
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC Butner), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. To provide care to inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider (MDI), such continuity of care is to avoid unnecessary legal exposure. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAICS code is 622110. To the best of our knowledge, Duke University Medical Center is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, FMC Butner will proceed with the sole source negotiated with Duke University Medical Center.

<SUBJECT>B -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  PERFORMANCE-BASED ACQUISITION
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): Performance-Based Acquisition. AGENCY: Office of Federal Procurement Policy, OMB.
RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT TO: The Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Julia Wise at e-mail:  jwise@omb.eop.gov, telephone number: (202)395-7561 or fax number: (202)501-5105 and the Defense Acquisition University, Leslie Deneault at email: leslie.deneault@dau.mil.

Description:  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) established a Performance- Based Acquisition (PBA) Interagency Working Group to facilitate the sharing of best practices and lessons learned on the use of PBAs.  A PBA acquisition strategy fosters the creativity and initiative of the private sector while providing the government services that meet their mission, improves customer satisfaction, increases competition, and has the potential to reduce the cost associated with the service acquisition.  On behalf of the Interagency Working Group, OFPP is issuing this notice as part of a market research effort to obtain information from both the public and private sector relating to PBA, including commercial sector best practices on using the PBA strategy. The Interagency Working Group is seeking information relating to methods, tools, lessons learned, techniques, performance standards and metrics, and recommendations for improving the current PBA process and guidance.

The Acquisition Advisory Panel (AAP) issued a report, "Report ofhe Acquisition Advisory Panel to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and Congress,"December 2006, which is located at http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/aap/index.html.  The Panel was tasked with reviewing several acquisition areas and recommending changes for improvement.  As a result of the AAP recommendations for strengthening and improving the use of PBA, OFPP is working to improve the effective use and management of PBA on service contracts and orders.  In that vein, OFPP has opted to initially focus on the Panel recommendations that relate to improving PBA guidance and training to enhance the acquisition workforce knowledge and use of PBA.  Four teams were established within the OFPP PBA Interagency Working Group to assist with the implementation of some portions of the Panel's recommendations and to develop government-wide guidance to further promote and enhance the effective use of the PBA strategy.  We are seeking information that can provide tangible value and benefits, improve awareness, strengthen the PBA process, and position the PBA as a preferred acquisition approach.   

Information sought by this notice pertains to Recommendations 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 from the Panel's report as stated below:  

Recommendation number 3 requires the development of a comprehensive PBA "Best Practices" guide for performance measures and metrics used for various types of service contracts focusing on the development and selection of performance measures for PBA contracts.   Please provide as many examples as possible of performance measures used in the following types of services:  IT services, operations and mission support services, advisory and assistance, and major system development services.  The guide to be developed will provide examples of key performance indicators for the various types of service contracts.  In addition to the information above, please inform us of your approach to the following questions:

1.	When do you use PBA and on what types of services?  
2.	How do you determine or make the decision that PBA is an appropriate strategy for your service acquisition?
3.	How do you develop performance measures for your acquisitions?
4.	What types of performance measures are included on certain types of service categories?
5.	What marketing techniques, systems, resources, etc., are used to establish performance measures?
6.	How do you monitor the contract to ensure the contractor meets the performance measures?
7.	How do you verify that the performance measures used are right for your service acquisition?
8.	Who monitors the contractor's performance and how often is it monitored?
9.	How and when do you adjust performance measures during the contract period?
10.	 What types of monitoring methods and/or tools (e.g., quality assurance surveillance plan, project management plan, etc.) are used to monitor a contractor's performance?

Recommendation 5 is related to recommendation 9 and it requires improvement in the post-award contract performance monitoring and management, including methods for continuous improvement and communication through the creation of a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) that would be appropriately tailored to the specific acquisition. Feedback in terms of sample PIP, elements contained in a PIP, etc., would be of interest as we consider the implementation of this recommendation.  Also provide documents that serve the same purpose.     

Recommendation 6 requires improved guidance on types of incentives appropriate for various contract vehicles.  Information is sought not only on the types of incentives (both financial and non-financial) available but also on the level of use of the various types of incentives; types of services suited for various types of incentives; the best way to apply incentives and when is it appropriate to do so; the challenges posed when administering incentives on a PBA; and the applicability of award fee and award term--when is it appropriate and on what types of services.  Information used to determine, award, manage and reassess an incentive arrangement will be useful market information for this task.  

Recommendation 7 suggests a revision of the Seven Steps process to reflect the Panel's recommendations.  Of particular interest is obtaining constructive suggestions, recommendations, and comments on the current Seven Steps to PBSA process.  A critique of the Seven Step PBSA guidance, available at http://acquisition.gov/SevenSteps, is of outmost importance.  All comments are welcome but at a minimum, provide detailed comments on the scope, format, how the process can be streamlined, is the process efficient, where can process improvements be made, and whether the process is understandable. 
 
Recommendation 9 requires improved data on PBA usage and enhanced oversight on proper PBA implementation using an Acquisition Performance Assessment Rating Tool (A-Part).  Questions may be developed for agencies to use to determine if an acquisition is consistent with the basic elements of the Seven Steps Guide and we would welcome input on the best questions to ask to make an appropriate assessment. The questions generated for this task will be completed after award of the performance-based contract or order and will remain in the contract file.  

Conclusion: The working group's primary focus is on recommendations 3 and 6.  However, information is desired on all the recommendations listed above, and submitters should highlight the corresponding recommendation number for any information provided.  Interested persons are invited to participate by submitting information, such as best practices, lessons learned, sample documents, or commercial practices relevant to their implementation of the performance-based acquisition strategy.  All responses and information shall be in written format (MS-Word 2003, Version 11, SP2) and transmitted electronically to the office listed in this RFI. 

Comments, ideas, and suggestions are strongly encouraged from all sources to include industry, federal agencies, state governments, and from any other sources that have used the PBA strategy, and should include information from all facets of the organization (e.g. sales, marketing, senior management, business development, capture planning, proposal management, contracts, and technical staff, etc.).  All respondents are encouraged to include comments where multiple vendors, contractors, and organizations may have experienced and/or been involved with the PBA process and the outcome and results of that acquisition (e.g. experience, format, scope, current guidance, advantages, disadvantages, and other information relating to improving the PBA process).  Furthermore, any references to methodologies, tools, services, products, processes, and/or technical approach should be expressed in vendor-neutral terms and/or all copyright and trademark rights observed and declared.  This notice is for market research purposes only.  The information provided is on a voluntary basis and may be used to improve the use of PBA. Please respond no later than November 19, 2007, to Julia Wise at e-mail:  jwise@omb.eop.gov, telephone number: (202)395-7561 or fax number: (202)501-5105 and the Defense Acquisition University, Leslie Deneault at email: leslie.deneault@dau.mil.

<CONTACT>Robert Lindquist, Contract Specialist, Phone 9546301164, Fax 9546301165, Email LindquistRA@state.gov
<DESC>Contractor Questions and Answers Round 2:

Question 13: Is the requirement for the vehicles to have "zero miles" literally meant as zero.?  I understand this is a solicitation for new automobiles but new cars rarely have zero since miles are incurred during transport.  What is a reasonable mileage range.

Answer 13: It's understood that it's difficult in some cases to avoid putting a few miles on vehicles because of requirements such as moving vehicles to suppliers, getting winches mounted, etc.  A very few miles would not be an issue, provided that it can be clearly shown that the miles are directly related to preparing the vehicles for delivery under the contract.  The main point is that it must be clear that the vehicles are new from the factory, and that they were not used as demonstration vehicles or in any other capacity that is inconsistent with being classified as new vehicles.

Question 14: We intend to acquire all vehicles in Ecuador or a neighboring country.  That being said, is Venezuela excluded as an option?

Answer 14: If the vehicles are a Venezuela end product, then they cannot be accepted since Venezuela is not a designated country under FAR 25.003.

Question 15: In the event that the vehicles are purchased from a location within Ecuador, do you require them to be at a central teaming location, delivered to the Embassy, or will they be picked up at the dealer?

Answer 15: The Embassy would provide the location where the vehicles need to be delivered.

Question 16: Warranty and title transfers will be a consideration in cost.  Each time a vehicle is titled additional cost will be incurred.  I assume whoever is awarded the contracts will be told the name of the shell company in whose name you intend to title the vehicles initially for the purpose of secrecy.  Am I correct in this assessment?

Answer 16: The vehicles will be titled to the Embassy.  The correct title information will be provided to the successful offeror(s) after award.

<CONTACT>Elaine Gray-Frasure, 611-816-2429
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 0001 to the original announcemnt W912GB-07-R-0031 is to respond to questions received to date.  In addition, the due date for submission is extended from 11 OCT 2007 to 24 OCT 2007, 1630 hrs, CET. Q1: Do you require ALL ACASS reports for the proposing Prime contractor for the last 3 years, or are you saying you want only 5 specific examples of ACASS reports specifically for cost control and estimating within the last 3 years?   A1: Selection Criteria, c. Past Performance, 2nd sentence is amended as follows:  Provide ACASS evaluations to support projects listed within the past three years.        Q2: It seems a little vague as to exactly what you require.  And, if we do supply all recent ACASS evals, can we create a table in Block H that states the project and rating, versus supplying all the lengthy evaluations? A2: Answer provided with Answer No. 1.  Q3: Could you please clarify what is meant in Special criteria B - Professional Disciplines by Technical Support?  Also are the 10 (ten) project descriptions restricted to one page?  A3: Technical Support is deleted from the announcement.   A ten project description is not restricted to one page. Q4: C-PAST PERFORMANCE references project specific work completed within the last three years and A-SPECIALIZED EXPEREINCE & TECHNICAL COMPETENCE references experience and technical knowledge within the last five years.  For the example projects in Block F  of the SF330, is the project history limited to three years or five years?   A4: Project history is limited to five years.  Past performance information is limited to three years.  Q5: Do the example projects described in Block F of the SF 330 need to complete or can they be in progress or ongoing?  A5:Example projects can be on-going. Q6: Under SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS, it states that Block F of the SF330 shall include example projects rather than example Contracts.  Do these examples need to be limited to 10 individual task orders or can a project include multiple task orders at a par ticular installation/location or an IDIQ/IDC for a Corps district or other DoD agency?   A6:Projects can include multiple task orders.   Q7: Weve noted that there is no defined page limitation for the submission identified in the solicitation.  Is there any page limitation? A7: No. Q8: Can submittals be in landscape format instead of portrait?  A8: Yes. Q9: There are 33 specific types of work described in the RFQ. Do we have to provide each type of work to be apart of the RFP or can we pick specific types of work for our quote?  A9: This is not an RFQ.  Paragraph 1 of the Announcement describes the various taskings that comprises Master Planning services.  To be considered qualified, firms should list their disciplines to perform the anticipated work described in the Annoucement . Q10: The RFQ lists Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet States.  Can we specifically select an area like the Middle East and Africa?  A10: See Selection Criteria e. Please refer to the original Annoucement for all other terms and conditions, which remain unchanged.
