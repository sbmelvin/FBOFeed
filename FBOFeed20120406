<DESC><p>711 HPW/USAFSAM conducts medical research in response to Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) needs. AFMS has grouped these needs into five major thrust areas: Enroute Care, Force Health Protection, Expeditionary Medicine, Operational Medicine and Human Performance.</p>
<p>Enroute Care - Focus is on continuum of care during transport of patients from point of injury to point of definitive care.</p>
<p>Force Health Protection - Focus is on prevention of injury and illness and the early recognition or detection of emerging threats.</p>
<p>Expeditionary Medicine/In Garrison - Focus is on improving expeditionary medical care during contingency operations including medical countermeasures against combat and operational stressors to maximize warrior health, performance and well-being.</p>
<p>Operational Medicine - Focus is on definitive patient care/treatment in garrison.</p>
<p>Human Performance: Focus is on operational human performance across the spectrum of Air Force warfighter operations.</p>
<p>The AFMS gathers medical research needs from Air Force major commands (MAJCOMs) and these form the basis for medical research projects. United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) performs applied medical research (6.2), medical technology development (6.3) and advanced component development (6.4) to: (1) develop capabilities for detection, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases of military significance and detection and identification of chemical and biological agents of mass destruction (WMD) that possess the capability to decrease military operational effectiveness, or disorders associated with trauma and/or debilitating morbidity or mortality; (2) seek novel ways to enhance biological or chemical agent surveillance and detection systems to gain the ability to rapidly detect pre-symptomatic infectious disease in order to mitigate the outbreak of naturally occurring endemic diseases and/or the covert or overt release of biological and chemical agents; (3) improve health surveillance situational awareness or increase new technology detection by integrating advanced diagnostics and other innovative technologies for rapid pathogen identification and detection with relevant information systems currently in operations; (4) develop automated monitoring of indoor structures and ventilation systems with self-regeneration capabilities and&lsquo;real time' monitoring rather than reaction development with secondary signal monitoring.</p>
<p>This requirement also includes pursuing research in the areas of deployed combat casualty care optimization and improvements in methods/techniques of remote patient monitoring, triage systems, and treatment of emerging threat injuries including operations involving irregular warfare, contingency operations and humanitarian relief operations. Other areas of research include: Pathophysiology of critical illness/injury during evacuation; complication of wounds/critical injury/critical illness by confounding factors introduced by aeromedical evacuation (AE) transport; mitigation of confounding factors introduced by AE transport; assessment of physiologic/neurophysiologic and inflammatory marker changes in flight; and multiple-patient monitoring.</p>
<p>USAFSAM conducts research pertaining to acceleration and altitude research, including aircrew training in these areas. Additional research interests are selected epidemiological studies and projects to advance aeromedical knowledge and performance-enhancement/protection in air and ground operations, and aerospace medicine and related fields. And finally, Clinical and Translational Research that will transition scientific findings from the laboratory to the clinical setting (e.g., operational environment/patient bedside: pre-hospital, clinic, or hospital; in-garrison, deployed, enroute care; includes education, training, and readiness) into best practice.</p>
<p>The types of requests for medical research are as diverse as the customer base. The projects may often involve the use of human subjects or live models due to the medical aspect of the research, which adds an additional layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Please see the full BAA announcement for the complete details.</p>

Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, train, monitor and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers conduct&not;ing intervention trials and other research on treatment, prevention, diagno&not;sis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infec&not;tion and disease in pediatric, adoles&not;cent, and maternal patient popula-tions, including both domestic and international clinical sites. The NICHD is announcing a competitive Request for Proposal for a Contractor to serve as the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Studies Coordinating center, which encompasses clinical studies and clinical trials on the treatment and management of HIV infection and associated co-infections and co-morbidities in infants, children, adolescents and pregnant and non-pregnant women domestically and internationally. The Coordinating Center contract currently manages a network of 34 clinical research sites throughout the United States (25) and in Latin America (9) that participate in studies through multiple research networks. The current contractor for this effort is WESTAT, Inc.
<p>Scope of activities: Current activities conducted within the Coordinating Center contract include the following:</p>
<p>1) NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network</p>
<p>The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network ("NICHD Network") has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987. The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women. The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network and Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN), the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC), and Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 25 centers, located in 18 cities, in 10 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are nine international clinical trials sites: eight sites in different areas of Brazil, and one in Argentina. It is anticipated that network sites will be re-competed in 2014 and will potentially include sites in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe in addition to Latin America and the United States. NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials. The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols. The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.</p>
<p>2) Site Monitoring of Phase III NICHD-Funded Investigator Initiated International trials</p>
<p>As the NICHD international research grant portfolio has increased to include large phase III clinical trials conducted in resource-limited countries, there is an increasing need to ensure that such investigator-initiated trials are conducted ethically, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, and with attention to human subject safety. The Coordinating Center will conduct site monitoring for selected NICHD grantees conducting large clinical trials to ensure appropriate trial conduct. The Coordinating Center is currently conducting monitoring for clinical trials in Botswana (Mpeu trial), Kenya (OPH03 and OPH612), South Africa (NEVEREST trial); Thailand (PHPT-5 trial); and Uganda (PROMOTE trials).</p>
<p>3. Data Analysis from Completed NICHD-Sponsored Clinical Studies and Trials</p>
<p>The NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI) consisted of two observational studies conducted in Latin America, one study (LILAC) in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants, and one study (PLACES) in HIV-infected children. This study will be completed before November 2012 but analyses of data from this study will continue into the new contract period. Additionally, the NICHD/HPTN 040-PACTG 1043 clinical trial, which evaluated infant combination antiretroviral prophylaxis when the mother did not receive antepartum antiretroviral drugs, was completed during 2011, but analyses of data from this study will continue into the new contract period. Thus, statistical/analytic capabilities for analyses of data from these completed studies are necessary for the Coordinating Center.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one term form cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded, for a period of performance of 5 years, beginning approximately December 1, 2012. The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about April 20, 2012 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about June 27, 2012. Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement. This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712. Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Lynn Salo at ls59u@nih.gov, or Contracting Officer or Elizabeth Osinski, Contracting Officer, at eo43m@nih.gov, or addressed to, NICHD Contracts Management Branch, Office of Acquisitions, NICHD, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 7A-07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if hand-delivered or sending by delivery service--6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852). No collect calls will be accepted. This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract. The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP NIH-NICHD-CRMC-2013-01. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.</p>

General Electric is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the current F414 engine required for this effort. The estimated period of performance for this acquisition is 12 months. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they can identify interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Responses must be received by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on 23 April 2012. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is: 336412-Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing. The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received. The Government will not pay for any information received. The point of contact is T. C. Renner Jr., Contract Specialist, via E-mail: thomas.c.renner@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 737-2746.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement number N00019-08-G-0009 to Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC), Syracuse, NY for engineering sustainment support of the E-2C Hawkeye AN/APS - 145 radar set.
<p>Engineering sustainment support requirements include systems engineering testing, investigation, and analysis of technical issues and the recommendation of corrective actions. Engineering sustainment services shall include responses to Government requests for information and participation in all relevant meetings as well as insight regarding all applicable documentation, such as requirements documents, specifications, and engineering change proposals.

The contractor shall maintain a design control activity at the contractor facility and provide insight to the Government on radar performance assurance, configuration management and integrated logistics support. The period of performance for this effort will be twelve (12) months from the date of order award.</p>
<p>LMC is the sole designer, developer, systems integrator and manufacturer of the APS-145 system and as such is the only firm possessing the knowledge, experience and technical data necessary to provide the required supplies and services in a timely manner for the purposes of meeting the fleet's operational needs. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and their capability to respond to the requirement or may submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within thirty days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate a sole source contract modification to TCOM, L.P., 7115 Thomas Edison Drive, Columbia, MD, 21046, for the procurement of: one (1) FSR Tool Kit, four (4) 28M+ Aerostat Delta Hub Spares, and one (1) 22M Aerostat Miscellaneous Spares Kit for TCOM 22M and 28M+ aerostat systems currently fielded in Afghanistan for the Naval Air Systems Command 4.5x Special Surveillance Programs (SSP). The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not own technical data, drawings or other specifications to permit full and open competition.

<DESC>This is a re-solicitation originally advertised under RFP number N6945012R1756.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued as a competitive 8(a) requirement limited to Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) certified small business firms located within SBA Region IV.  SBA Region IV includes the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE) has been tasked to develop, solicit, and award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award construction contract (MACC) for general construction type work for activities in the South Carolina and Georgia areas.
  Work may be required in other areas in the area of responsibility of NAVFAC SE if deemed necessary.  This solicitation will result in the award of up to five (5) Design Build IDIQ MACCs, unless a number more than five (5) is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Construction projects to be performed will primarily consist of general building type projects (new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, repair work, and any necessary design) including: industrial, airfield, aircraft hangar, aircraft traffic control, infrastructure, administrative, training, retail, food service, dormitory, community support facilities and both vertical and horizontal construction.  All projects will be required to meet sustainable design requirements.
  The total aggregate value for all contracts to be awarded from any resultant solicitation is $99,000,000 maximum over the base year and four (4) option periods combined.  There is no yearly or per contractor limit except for the total five (5) year maximum.  Task orders will be firm fixed-priced, normally in the range of $150,000 to $6,000,000 per order.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued as a competitive requirement open to all SBA Region IV 8(a) certified small business firms in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2, Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources.

  The NAICS code for this IDIQ MACC solicitation is 236220 with a size standard of $33,500,000.  

The source selection method to be used is a best value continuum process in a negotiated two-phase acquisition utilizing the trade-off approach.  Formal two-phase source selection will be used to select the proposals that provide the best value to the Government from a technical and price standpoint.  In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.1 and 15.3, a trade-off approach to source selection will be used for this solicitation with respect to the initial award.  The solicitation evaluation factors for the MACC award will state that technical factors are equal in importance to each other and, when combined, are approximately equal to price.
  Future task orders will also be competed using trade-off procedures.  

Offerors selected to proceed to Phase-Two will be required to submit a technical and price proposal for a seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit a technical and a price proposal will not be considered for an award.  The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded an IDIQ MACC for a base year with four (4) option years and the seed project task order.  The remaining four (4) selected offerors will be awarded an IDIQ MACC for a base year and four (4) option years with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 over the five (5) year period.

<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") intends to award a sole source contract to Dr. James&nbsp;Moser, formerly Deputy Chief Economist for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for consulting services to CFTC. Prior to his retirement on March 30, 2012, Dr. Moser led initiatives where quantitative analyses were used to detect violations of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. &sect; 9, 13(b) and 13(a)(2) (2006), which make it unlawful for any person to attempt to manipulate the market of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, including any contract market. Dr. Moser's research agenda focuses on three questions: What is the contribution of derivatives to the real economy? What arrangements do private markets make to resolve problems arising from use of derivatives? And, what is the proper role of government in regulating derivatives activity? He has devoted a significant amount of time and effort in building expertise in the trading of derivatives through research and discussion with major industry participants and providers. His previous industry positions were at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a Research Officer and at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange where he was a Senior Director. He has held academic positions at Louisiana Tech, Michigan State University and the University of Kentucky. He received his BS in Economics from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1978 and Ph.D. in Finance from Ohio State in 1986.&nbsp; Dr. Moser's knowledge, experience, and personal contacts are not easily replaced, nor are individuals with this knowledge generally available to the Commission. His ability to communicate with both technical experts and Commission policy makers concerning technical matters is both a rare and an essential skill, and together with his knowledge of ongoing matters at the Commission, his qualifications are irreplaceable in the near term. CFTC anticipates awarding a one-year contract using FAR Part 12&nbsp;and Part 13 procedures for these services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the response date and time identified in this synopsis. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source contract described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC. <br />

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a Switchgear Replacement at the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Ann Arbor, MI. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT AN OPEN MARKET PROCUREMENT. A JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 6.302-2, UNUSUAL AND COMPELLING URGENCY. <br /><br />The statutory authority for the proposed action is FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency. This authority applies in situations where the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals. <br /><br />Request for Proposal (RFP) GS-05P-11-SV-C-0017 for the project, Switchgear Replacement, was issued via FedBizOpps.gov on August 2, 2011 with a closing date and time of September 1, 2011, 4:00pm Central Standard Time. <br /><br />A contract award was made on September 29, 2011 to the contractor offering the best value to the Government. After award and prior to the commencement of any work, a bi-lateral agreement (no-cost settlement termination for convenience) was reached with the contractor. <br /><br />The requirement for the work still exists and the present switchgear is old, past its useful life and showing signs of excessive wear. Aside from almost frequent repair work, some parts are no longer available. The GFI breakers inside the switchgear are breaking down. In light of the aforementioned, immediate replacement is necessary to avoid electrical power failure in the event of a major breakdown. <br /><br />GSA determined it would be in the best interest of the Government to award the contract to the contractor providing the best value had the prior contractor not been given the initial award. This company, Allied Building Services, represents the best value to the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center Togus, ME, is seeking a contractor to provide external consultation for the Sanford Vet Center. This is a Firm Fixed Priced solicitation with an anticipated period of performance beginning May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013 with four (4) one (1) year options at the discretion of the VA Medical Center. 

On the basis of extensive congressional testimony and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) consultation with experts on war-related readjustment difficulties, the character of "readjustment counseling" was established during a 10-year legislative history between 1969 and 1979. In 1979, the Congress passed, and the President signed, Public Law 96-22, which added to 38 U.S.C., Section 1712A, providing readjustment counseling to any eligible Vietnam Era veteran. As implemented by the VA in 1979, readjustment counseling is provided through a nation-wide system of community-based Vet Centers. In 1982, the VA initiated a new organizational element, RCS (Readjustment Counseling Service), to administer the Vet Centers and the provision of readjustment counseling.  

Clinical Consultation is required for all clinical staff at Vet Centers IAW VHA Handbook 1500.01.  

The solicitation is a total small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS code is 621330 and the size standard is $7 Million.

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) is an independent, bipartisan board that sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as The Nation's Report Card. NAEP makes objective information on student performance available to policy makers and the public at the national, state, and local levels. It has served an important role in evaluating the condition and progress of American education for more than three decades. Created by Congress in 1988, the Governing Board is made up of 26 members, including governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators and researchers, business representatives, and members of the general public. More information on the Governing Board and its work is at www.nagb.org.
<p><br />The Governing Board has important congressional mandates to set policy for the NAEP and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results, plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. A key component in providing feedback on the Governing Board's work and disseminating NAEP is through expanded outreach activities with targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to the NAEP, particularly with the Common Core State Standards, it is important to encourage and expand the involvement of state policymakers and educators in providing information and input to the Governing Board in executing its congressionally mandated responsibilities.</p>
<p>Since September 2007, the Governing Board has partnered with the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) to establish a jointly sponsored Task Force. The Governing Board/CCSSO Policy Task Force provides advisory and support services.&nbsp;The Task Force is charged with providing feedback from states including recommendations to the National Assessment Governing Board on policy areas and projects related to the NAEP.</p>
<p>The goal of this collaboration is to seek state input and feedback that informs the Governing Board's policy setting work in specific areas. Therefore, the Task Force is comprised of 12 high-level state education agency leaders including 1 chief state school officer, 8 members who are either deputy or assistant superintendents, and 3 public information officers. This wide cross section of perspectives vested in education will help shape careful and extensive deliberations on many NAGB/NAEP policy areas.</p>
<p>The Task Force conducts its work through webinars and in-person meetings. The work and partnership are facilitated by a purchase order each fiscal year. The Task Force provides regular reports to the Governing Board, which are available to the public via meeting transcripts of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings.</p>
<p>In each fiscal year, two in-person meetings and four webinars shall be convened. Topics to be discussed by the Task Force include reporting approaches for the 2012 and 2013 NAEP reports, 12th grade preparedness research and reporting issues, achievement level setting, testing students with disabilities and English language learners, subjects assessed by NAEP including their value to states, and NAEP's role in the era of the Common Core State Standards and assessments. In addition, one Task Force member shall attend each of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings as an observer to share and promote communication between the Governing Board and the Task Force.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition, and under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source - the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) - has the unique membership of Chief State School Officers and state policymakers who have the knowledge and ability to provide state perspectives and outreach services representing all 50 states. This coordination among all 50 states and the federal government is essential for making informed policy decisions related to The Nation's Report Card and for carrying out the Board's congressionally-mandated responsibilities.</p>
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the CCSSO in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisitions, under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.</p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation will not be issued. However, all capability statements received by March 19, 2012 will be considered by the Governing Board in developing the proposed acquisition strategy. Questions or suggestions received before March 9, 2012 will have written responses posted via www.fedbizopps.gov. Please submit written questions or comments to Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice

The Veterans Integrated Service Network 6 (VISN 6) Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network (hereto after referred to as the Network) is seeking Mammography Reporting System (MRS) to assist VHA providers with managing our Women Veteran population.  Women veterans require gender-specific services such as breast cancer screening (mammography), cervical cancer screening (Pap smears) and menopause management (including bone density testing for osteoporosis). A MRS software tracking system is needed that can interface to VISTA Health Level 7 (HL7), CPRS and Voice Recognition / Power Scribe version 5, for dictation to allow VHA providers to have access to mammography results and to ensure appropriate follow-up and treatment, thereby improving patient safety and minimizing risk of "missed" results.

The MRS will be deployed/installed at five facilities in our Network (VAMC Durham NC, Fayetteville NC, Salisbury NC, Richmond VA and Hampton VA).  The MRS will need to have to capacity to provide mammography services for the other VA Medical Centers in our Network and affiliated outpatient clinics.  The MRS will also provide tracking for those mammograms that are performed by a mobile unit at later date.  The MRS shall be deployed through a single central data base server solution and link/interface to independent Vista Servers at each facility.  The central data base server will be set up in Durham NC with the VA OI&T staff responsible for set-up of the server.  

Basic Requirements:

-	MRS application, software and server.  

-	The MRS system must interface to VISTA Health Level 7 (HL7) Interface Specifications.   

-	Must interface with Nuance, Power Scribe version 5  Voice Recognition for dictation.  

-	Must interface with Hologic digital reading workstation and automatically synchronize with MRS application to display patient breast history.  

-	Ability to receive basic patient and procedure information for other information systems via an HL7 interface which reduces duplicating demographic entries and reporting functions.     

A determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation or a commitment by the Government to later publish a solicitation. This is not a request for a competitive quotation.

<DESC>Request for Information

Implementation of Identity Proofing Document Validation, 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) 

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government. This is NOT a Request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists, and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses received to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response or demonstration expenses. Any information received will become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.
The Office of Information Technology (OIT) and the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness (OSP) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issue this RFI for an identity proofing document validation capability to support VA HSPD-12 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential issuance processes.  The VA PIV credential issuance process must enforce knowledge-based identity proofing to augment and verify presented I-9 documents at the time of registration, and/or to substitute for I-9 documents.  An incremental capability is envisioned that may not directly interface with the HSPD-12 PIV system initially, but will validate I-9 identity documents as a basis for PIV credential issuance and interface with the VA PIV system in future increments as the capability matures.  The concept and requirements associated with identity proofing are depicted throughout the recent Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Roadmap and Implementation Guidance, Version 2.0 ; the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 201 (FIPS-201); and associated NIST special publications.   
BACKGROUND
The HSPD-12 PIV System contains authoritative data on VA employees, contractors, affiliates, and others. External systems will use this data to make logical and physical access control decisions.  The integrity of the data stored within the PIV system must be improved so external system business owners can rely on and have a high level of confidence in the data.  HSPD-12 PIV system authoritative data must be complete, current, accurate, and valid.  The validation of I-9 documents contributes to improving the integrity of PIV system data.  Data integrity will become increasingly important as more and more systems leverage the data stores within the PIV system over the life cycle of the HSPD-12 PIV system. The security and personnel information is necessary to meet critical FIPS 201 requirements, and ensure completeness of HSPD-12 PIV system data stores.  Identity proofing contributes to increased data integrity ensuring that PIV applicants are issued credentials based on validated I-9 documents and ensuring this data is available for audit and reporting purposes.
I-9 document verification is currently performed by visual inspection of the documents by PIV Registrars. The VA requires a common, verifiable, and traceable solution that can be deployed to all PIV Registrar sites and that achieves compliance with the FIPS 201 requirement. A Registrar must electronically verify the authenticity of any source document, when the issuer of that document provides such services. 
NIST FIPS-201-2, the standards publication for PIV, states that "During identity proofing, the applicant shall be required to provide two forms of identity source documents in original form.  The primary identity source document shall be neither expired nor cancelled and qualify as acceptable form of identifications as per the comprehensive list provided in FIPS 201. 
The VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) published several recommendations in their "Audit of Enrollment Centers' Implementation of Personal Identity Verification Requirements" in September 2011.  Recommendation 6 states that "We recommend the Assistant Secretary of Operations, Security, and Preparedness issue guidance to ensure Registrars authenticate the source and integrity of identity documents used during the Personal Identity Verification credential enrollment process through official Federal and State databases." 
The scope of this requirement includes approximately 284 PIV site locations with approximately 3 registered users per site, throughout a range of VA facilities across the United States.
This identity proofing document validation solution shall deliver the following benefits:
"	Increased security in user identification and authentication, logging, and auditing
"	Compliance with laws, regulations, and standards
"	Improved customer service via single authoritative data capture of credentials and elimination of redundancy
"	Secure infrastructure for the protection of all Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

REQUIREMENTS
The PIV applicant registration process must enforce knowledge-based identity proofing to augment and verify presented I-9 documents at the time of registration, and/or provide other identity validation capability as a substitute for I-9 documents.  The PIV System shall incorporate mechanisms that permit the validation of I-9 identity documents as a legitimate source of identification.  The initial capability may not have a direct interface with the HSPD-12 PIV system, but will validate I-9 identity documents as a basis for PIV credential issuance. 
Responses should address the following requirements about the envisioned solution and/or technologies.
"	Validate extensive list of primary and secondary identity source documents.  Listing exceptions to I-9 documents that cannot be validated. Talk to the reliability of the document validation (what is the error rate, false positives, false negatives, etc.).
"	Must include costs related to subscription services including and not limited to annual and/or multiple year renewals.
"	May include hardware and software configurations.
o	Including customization options and capabilities
"	Must include maintenance options including patches, upgrades, hardware repair and replacement, and phone support. 
"	Must include training for all PIV personnel and VA help desk personnel as deemed appropriate by VA.
"	Must include an outline of the process, procedures, and capabilities offered for consulting and customization services.
"	Must include details on any  APIs and standards available for interfacing with system
Topic 1 - I-9 Document Verification
1.	Describe functionality, and basic components of the document verification solution including but not limited to the technologies used, document types verified, and services provided.
2.	The Contractor shall provide a recommended architecture that ensures initial capability of the recommended document verification solution. The document verification systems shall be physically located in the same locations as the current PIV Registrar systems.
3.	Provide an open standards based interface (compliant with VA security standards) to various systems to allow for information exchanges to occur.
4.	Provide a consolidated view of identity proofing data and associated attributes to VA applications, data sources, and personnel from disparate authoritative data sources.
5.	Provide logging and audit capability for document verification activities.
6.	Define the process by which the new document verification solution will be accepted, used, operated, and maintained.
a.	Provide transition plans that address aspects of transition management (including training, operation, transition timing, staging of transition, contingency measures, etc.) which pertain to the actual acceptance, use, operations, and maintenance of the solution.
b.	Provide training materials for all hardware and software for each site facility (manuals, reference guides, operating instructions, support procedures, etc.) and methods (online, train-the-trainer, classroom, etc.) to facilitate a smooth transition to the new solution.
7.	Provide Operations and Maintenance (O&M) support of the document verification solution. The solution should have the ability to:
a.	Provide 24/7 tier/level 2 and 3 Help Desk support through subject matter experts/vendors and problem diagnosis documentation for tier/level 1 help desk. Level 1 help will be performed by VA National Service Desks that are already in place;
b.	Provide Inventory and Asset Management records of the solution that can be imported/exported into the corresponding VA inventory/ asset management system;
c.	Provide preventive and corrective maintenance support for the systems and all subsystem elements to include product warranties and maintenance agreements.

Implementation of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Site Scheduling Capability, 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) 

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government. This is NOT a Request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists, and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses received to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response or demonstration expenses. Any information received will become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.
The Office of Information Technology (OIT) and the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness (OSP) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issue this RFI for a PIV Site Scheduling capability in support of the Department of VA Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential issuance systems and processes.  The VA PIV credential issuance process would benefit from online scheduling software allowing the Department of Veterans Affairs and staff to operate more efficiently and effectively ultimately helping to reduce overall costs associated with the PIV credential issuance lifecycle. A capability is envisioned that will provide appointment scheduling of specific time-slots, allow customer self-scheduling, generate confirmation and notification emails, and offer management, analysis, and reporting functionality. This capability should assist in minimizing the number of customer visits to VA facilities to obtain PIV, non-PIV, and Flash Pass badges. The Department of Veterans Affairs seeks to employ an online scheduling system that is robust and user-friendly. Effective appointment scheduling is important not only to ensure cards are issued to users in a timely fashion, but to also decrease scheduling errors that can decrease productivity and cause inconvenience for those applicants who must travel to credentialing stations.  This enterprise wide tool will manage individual customer visits to issuance facilities, ensuring efficiency in the credential issuance process. This will provide improved customer service and increase customer satisfaction for our Veterans, VA employees, contractors, and affiliates.  
BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT), Service Delivery and Engineering, is to provide benefits and services to veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, OIT strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout the points of the veterans' health care system in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.
On August 27, 2004, a Homeland Security Presidential Directive was issued entitled HSPD-12, "Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors."  HSPD-12 directed the promulgation of a new Federal standard for secure and reliable identification issued by Federal agencies for their employees and contractors.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 201 - Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201) on February 25, 2005.  FIPS 201 and its associated Special Publications provide a detailed specification for Federal agencies and departments deploying personal identity verification (PIV) cards for their employees and contractors.  
VA has established and is maintaining an enterprise, standards-based authentication and authorization infrastructure to support the seamless transmission of secure business transactions and information within VA and its business and operational partners while meeting the requirements of HSPD-12 and FIPS 201.  The architecture leveraged addresses the requirements of HSPD-12, FIPS-201, and the Federal Common Policy.  
The Department of Veterans Affairs has approximately 284 brick and mortar or mobile facilities performing credential issuance activities.  Only a limited number of current issuance sites have an online appointment booking capability.  The Department of Veterans Affairs needs a centralized web-based appointment scheduling solution enabling credential issuance operations and credential lifecycle sustainment.  The scope of this requirement includes ~284 VA owned, leased, and contracted credential issuance facilities supporting a user population of approximately 400,000 individuals.
The site scheduling solution shall deliver the following benefits:
"	Maximize staff efficiency and assist in minimizing credential lifecycle costs
"	Gives full visibility of your resources
"	Increased productivity through increased utilization
"	Decreased turnaround time and increased throughput
"	Reduced schedule management with automatic skills checking
"	Full availability checks and conflict management
"	Eliminates unnecessary paperwork
"	Improved customer service for Veterans, VA employees, contractors, and affiliates

REQUIREMENTS
The Department of Veterans Affairs needs online scheduling software to support credential issuance, also commonly known as online reservation software.  This capability has quickly become a "must-have" for any service-based business or organization looking for a better and more efficient way to schedule its employees, contractor, and affiliates credential appointments and reservations. Booking service appointments and reservations over the phone and manually managing them in a paper schedule book, calendar or spreadsheet can be a tedious and time-consuming process.
Site scheduling capability responses should address the following requirements about the envisioned solution and/or technologies:
"	Role based functionality:  Must provide Registrar work flow features. 
o	The solution, at minimum, shall include support for the distinct system roles of administrator, registration official ("registrar"), and end user ("applicant")
o	The administrator role shall be able to define and customize appointment qualification checklist attributes (data fields) for use by registrar users.  Qualification checklist data shall be associated with each appointment record.
"	The site scheduling software must be configurable to assist in the enforcement of Department of Veterans Affairs HSPD-12 credential issuance business rules.  (e.g. a user can only have one active appointment in the system)
"	Must have the capability to support pre-defined appointment conditions, and able to check user profile status before approval to a select an appointment type. (e.g. meet requirements prior to scheduling a fingerprint appointment)
"	Self-Scheduling, which allows individuals to schedule their own appointments and reservations online and when it's most convenient for them. Not only does this popular feature of the online scheduling software system keep a business open 24 hours a day, it also frees up a significant amount of staff time and resources that otherwise would have been spent answering calls, returning voice messages, and replying to e-mails.
"	Reduce no-show rate, especially with a basic check list feature, which results in PIV applicants being more knowledgeable of their card application process and status. This also saves CARD applicants and VA PIV CARD staff time, and frees up availability for more face-to-face appointments.
"	Online help resources can help applicants find CARD application related forms minimizing time spent at issuance facilities. 
"	Sync to customer's calendars and send electronic notifications and reminders.
"	Must support the current PIV credential applicant processes and use cases.  In future increments this application would be able to retrieve/import data from the current PIV system, validating applicant requirements prior to scheduling a credential issuance appointment.
"	Must be able to assist in the management of available resources, alerting service staff based on facility locations and credential type.
"	Must include reporting and tracking capability for VA to monitor key service metrics.
"	Must include maintenance options including patches, upgrades, and phone support. 
"	Must include training for all PIV personnel and VA help desk personnel as deemed appropriate by VA.
"	Must include an outline of the process, procedures, and capabilities offered for consulting and customization services.

The current Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) add-on groin protector equipment only offers protection from frontal threats.  PM SPE believes a two-tiered system will provide the optimal combination of protection and user acceptance. The Tier II - POG - part of the Pelvic Protection System - is an item that will provide protection against ground based IED threats.   The POG is worn over the Army Combat Uniform trousers and provides protection of the pelvis, femoral arteries, and lower abdominal organs in a blast or fragmentation event.

Ballistic filler weight of center section shall not exceed 0.40 lb/ft2 with a maximum 0.10 in. thickness.<br><br>- Shall provide a secure fastening mechanism to prevent flapping or shifting during use.  The system shall be compatible with currently fielded personal protective equipment and combat uniform and shall attach either to the body armor and/or the belt loops of the trousers.<br><br>- Front section shall be capable of being disconnected from the center/rear section and worn as a standalone item, with the option of fastening to the belt or Improved Outer Tactical Vest.  Shall provide a secure fastening mechanism to prevent flapping or shifting during use.  <br><br>- Attachment point(s) connecting the front section to center section must be able to withstand a peak load of 150 lbs break strength in accordance with ASTM D-5043<br><br>- Attachment points/seams connecting the rear panel to center section must be able to withstand a peak load of 600 lbs break strength in accordance with ASTM D-5043<br><br><br>-  Shall be capable of donning and doffing without removing the belt from the Army Combat Uniform trousers<br><br>-  Must be available in multiple sizes to fit 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male waist circumference.<br><br>- Outer facing cloth shall be constructed with the following camouflage pattern: US Army Operational Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP)<br><br>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Responses shall include the following information:<br>a.

</a>
<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.  The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers received after February 22, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted.  

Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number  (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.  For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

This refresh includes the addition of five (5) new SINs for Ancillary Supplies and/or Services: 260-1000, 465-1000, 633-1000, 246-1000, and 426-1000. These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN. 

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 246-50; services previously covered under SIN 246-50 are now covered under new SIN 246-1000.

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 260-98; services previously covered under SIN 260-98 are now covered under new SIN 260-1000.

<p>The Food and Drug Administration's National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requires 4,000 kg of special low phytoestrogen animal chow for two projects (0218601 &amp; 0218801) that will study a sunscreen agent. The studies are being done in conjunction with another National Toxicology Program (NTP) study that will be done at another facility at the same time. In order to tie the studies together as closely as possible, we must use the identical animal chow as will be used in the companion study. We have utilized one specific formula (5K96 Verified Casein Diet) from the Purina Mills (PMI) brand for our dose-finding study (0217801) and found that it provided good nutritional support of pregnant rats. Additionally, since the point of the study is to determine if the sunscreen agent disrupts normal reproductive function, the chow must be very low in endogenous estrogenic compounds, as these compounds would interfere with our ability to determine the true effect of the sunscreen agent. The PMI 5K96 chow has been tested at NCTR and has been found to have very low levels of phytoestrogen (genistein and daidzein) compounds, consistent with the acceptable levels for the study protocols.</p>
<p>In order to compare results from this study with the companion NTP study, we must use the identical laboratory animal chow to feed laboratory rats. This chow must be identical in formulation so that the nutrition provided to the animals is identical to those in the companion study and, even more critically, the levels of phytoestrogen (genistein and daidzein) content must be strictly controlled so that the study results can be validated. Additionally, the chow must be irradiated prior to shipment to remove any bacterial contamination. Use of any chow that is not identical to the specified chow could invalidate the research.<br /><br />BASE PERIOD<br />PMI 5K96 Verified Casein Meal, Irradiated Rat Chow<br />Period of Performance: Date of Award to 08/01/2012.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p><a name="wp1192425"></a></p>
<p>(A) <em>The tax liability is finally determined</em>. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p><a name="wp1192426"></a></p>
<p>(B) <em>The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment</em>. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><a name="wp1192429"></a></p>
<p>(ii) <em>Examples</em>.</p>
<p><a name="wp1192589"></a></p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><a name="wp1192595"></a></p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><a name="wp1192432"></a></p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p><a name="wp1192532"></a></p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)<br />CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)<br />FAR 52.217-7, Option for Increased Quantity -- Separately Priced Line Item (Mar 1989)<br />The Government may require the delivery of the numbered line item, identified in the Schedule as an option item, in the quantity and at the price stated in the Schedule. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period of performance. Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-12-R-H00008 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the small business size standard is $25 million.  These items/services are for the USCG HC-130H aircraft. The Government intends to issue a firm fixed-price contract to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the required items/services, Teledyne Controls, El Segundo, CA 90245.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.  The Coast Guard does not own, nor can it provide drawings or technical data related to this requirement.  Delivery to the USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Attn: LCDR Clint Schlegel/Tony Simpson, ALC Flight Safety Office, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001 shall be f.o.b. destination.  Firm Fixed-Price offers will be evaluated based on a lowest cost technically acceptable basis.  The U. S. Coast Guard has a requirement to upgrade the existing Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) (P/N 2233000-936) software on the HC130H.  Deliverables will be CLIN 1 Non-recurring Engineering Support, CLIN 2 HC-130H A1U software configuration, and CLIN 3 Documentation support to include systems requirement specification, acceptance test plan, qualification test plan, and qualification test report.  

1.	BACKGROUND
a.	The USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Flight Safety Office has outfitted the HC-130H and HU-25 aircraft with a Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU). The FDAU is a device that captures and processes various aircraft parameter information such as discrete, digital and analog data. This data is then output in a single data stream to the Voice/Flight Data Recorder (VFDR). The FDAU installations began in 2007 and are being performed during Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM). 
b.	The HC-130H will be undergoing, in 2012, an Avionics First Phase Upgrade (A1U) that will remove a significant number of the existing aircraft systems that are supplying data to the FDAU. These aircraft systems will be replaced with newer, more efficient and information abundant systems. As a result of these changes, the current FDAU software for the HC-130H will no longer work on those modified aircraft. Therefore, the FDAU will require a software modification that will add a configuration for the HC-130H modified with A1U.
c.	It is the intent of this Statement of Work to add a third configuration for the HC-130H A1U to the existing FDAU. The original configurations for the HC-130H and HU-25 will remain. They are identified by ground strapping on the FDAU unit tray. The A1U will also be identified by a specific ground strap configuration.

2.	DOCUMENTATION
a.	Data 
i.	The Contractor shall provide the following information to the ALC Flight Safety Office, c/o LCDR Clint Schlegel and Tony Simpson.
1.	An initial project timeline which will be followed to ensure project progress.
2.	Weekly status updates providing project progress. 
3.	An Acceptance Test Procedure for the newly modified unit.
4.	An Engineering Test Procedure for the newly modified unit.
5.	A Qualification Test Procedure for the newly modified unit.
6.	A Software Requirements Specification for the newly modified unit.
7.	A software configuration file for decompressing the new software, as well as the parameter definitions. 


3.  REQUIREMENTS
b.	UPGRADE THE HC-130H FDAU
i.	The Contractor shall add one additional aircraft parameter configuration to the existing FDAU P/N 2233000-936 for the HC-130H with the Avionics Upgrade. 
1.	The Contractor shall develop an additional aircraft parameter configuration for the HC-130H for the Avionics Upgrade. This configuration will be designed using the parameter definitions provided by the USCG. Additional parameters or any pertinent parameters that have not been identified may be added as they become apparent. At that time, a modification will be created to add any additional parameters. 
2.	The Contractor shall establish the new configuration to be identified by the FDAU using ground strapping. The FDAU shall know by ground pins which HU-25 or HC-130H configuration to upload.
3.	The Parameter configuration will consist of data coming from undisturbed existing systems as well as new systems. 104 parameters will be retained from the original HC-130H FDAU configuration. Just over 350 parameters are new from 16 new ARINC 429 data busses and one 1553 data bus. (See appendix 1 and 2)
4.	The Contractor shall provide all Engineering Unit calculations for decompression associated with the configuration.
5.	Once the Contractor establishes the configuration for the HC-130H with the Avionics Upgrade, the configuration and design shall be subjected to Qualification Testing developed by Teledyne Controls and approved by the USCG Flight Safety Office. This Qualification testing will include operational testing to ensure the configuration operates in the lab as well as on the aircraft. 
6.	The Contractor shall provide a portable means to load the configuration into the FDAUs at the air station level. The configuration will be loaded into all USCG purchased FDAUs as well as any being repaired by manufacturer. 
7.	The Contractor shall be available to make any and all necessary changes needed during on-aircraft configuration testing. All parameters that require adjustment will be repaired and provided in another configuration release.

4.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
c.	FDAU Upgrade
i.	The modified FDAU software shall be developed at the contractors facility. The contractor shall develop the proposed upgrade using their laboratory units. Once the design is established and tested, the USCG will provide a unit for prototyping, if needed. The prototype FDAU software, upon completion, shall be delivered to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Attn: LCDR Clint Schlegel/Tony Simpson, ALC Flight Safety Office, Elizabeth City, NC 27909 for on-aircraft testing.
ii.	Upon test completion and acceptance of the HC-130H A1U configuration, the remaining FDAUs will be loaded with the configuration.
 
5.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
d.	FDAU Software Upgrade
i.	The Contractor shall establish the design and modification of the prototype software within 3 months of Contract award. All supporting preliminary documentation shall be developed and approved within that same time frame.
ii.	The Contractor must have the preliminary software configuration completed and loaded into a FDAU by May 3, 2012. The HC-130H A1U will commence flight testing on or about June 1, 2012 and the software must be ground tested successfully prior to first flight.
iii.	Upon completion, the configuration will be tested on the aircraft. The airframe is undergoing installation from January to June  2012. Testing may take several months to accomplish.

6.  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE
e.	Inspection
i.	The USCG ALC Flight Safety Office will provide preliminary acceptance of the FDAU HC-130H software once it has been inspected/tested on the HC-130H for proper operation and function. Due to aircraft scheduling, actual evaluation period of acceptance is estimated at less than two months.
ii.	The Government retains the right to have the Contractor provide support for any issues that may arise with the FDAU hardware or its software stemming from the HC-130H software modification at no additional cost.

7.  PACKAGING
    N/A

8.  TRAVEL
f.	Travel to Elizabeth City
i.	Travel is not anticipated. The USCG reserves the right to request the Contractor be readily available for on-aircraft troubleshooting and able to travel to NC within a reasonable amount of time.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special rule for related partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Provide materials, labor, and supervision to Fabricate Ballistic Trap at the Coast Guard Academy. The CGA maintains two indoor ranges rated for velocities fewer than 2000 feet per second. The escalator type trap currently used on the north range was installed in the early 1970's. During training in February on, bay "C" of the rifle range two plates of the four were damaged and penetrated by the use of full metal jacket high velocity rifle ammunition in excess of 2000 feet per second. Due to severe warping and concaving of the plates, replacement of the damaged sections is not an option. The entire bay must be repaired or replaced. Proposal shall include modern trap technology to stop mil-spec ammunition types such as A059 and A131, 5.56mm and 7.62mm. The bay is 14.9 feet wide and is located in the lower level Chase Hall A annex north side. See attached Scope of Work for detailed requirements.

The vessels were built in 1953 by Higgins Ship Building in New Orleans and referred to as T-boats. The goal of the shiphandling program is to expose cadets to the man overboard (MOB), anchoring, emergency steering and mooring and unmooring evolutions onboard the 65' T-Boat. <br />Each student is introduced to the principles of single screw shiphandling, shipboard engineering and deck seamanship while continuing to grow and develop as leaders of peer leaders. The program culminates with a final exercise during which the students plan, brief and execute an inland/coastal transit of the Thames River and Fisher's Island Sound. During the exercise the students perform a variety of routine shiphandling and seamanship evolutions while also responding to limited shipboard emergencies.<br />Currently two T-boats are equipped with Twin Disc MG-514C Marine Gears. The third T-boat is equipped with a Twin Disc MG-512 Marine Gear. All three units are approximately 30 years old and leak oil. These marine gears are the incorrect ratio for any suitable replacement engine.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK


A.	GENERAL INFORMATION 

1.	Design a Plan for Valet Parking and Shuttle Bus Service at the Martinsburg VA
Medical Center

2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.  Although some equipment may be necessary, this contract is for design work in the furtherance of a future, separate contract that would, if implemented, provide valet parking and shuttle bus service.

	3.  Background:  The Martinsburg VA Medical Center occupies 178 acres of land (see attached campus map) in Berkeley County, West Virginia.  The Medical Center provides a full range of inpatient and outpatient medical services to some 25,000 enrolled Veterans.  The Medical Center experiences a high-volume of vehicular traffic Monday through Friday during the hours 7:30am-5:00pm.  Parking for Veterans may be difficult during these peak hours.  Various parking lots are utilized, and the distance from a parking spot to a building entrance can exceed 100 yards.  The Medical Center is exploring the feasibility of providing Valet parking services, as well as Shuttle Bus Services.  These services would aid Veterans with limited mobility.  It would also enhance overall safety, convenience and customer service for the facility.  As a first-step in the feasibility process, the Medical Center would like a customized, detailed and comprehensive plan to be designed by a firm with extensive and expert experience in the field.  The finished plan would include all of the details on staffing, arrangements, flow patterns, required equipment, preferred practices and other such considerations necessary for providing a smooth, efficient, and experience-enhancing service for Veterans at the Medical Center.

4.  Performance Period:  The work shall begin within fourteen (14) calendar days of award, unless otherwise specified.  Work at the Government site shall not take place on Federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the CO.  Work at the Government site shall take place during normal, daytime working hours. The contractor shall complete the work required under the base item in twenty-one (21) calendar days or less from date of award, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer (CO).  If the contractor proposes an earlier completion date, and the Government accepts the contractor's proposal, the contractor's proposed completion date shall prevail. The contractor shall complete the work required under Option 1 in 21 days from date option is exercised.

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable best value source selection. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated price offeror that is determined to have a technically acceptable proposal and receives an acceptable past performance rating. <br />The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. The Government will evaluate the technical proposals and assign ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.</p>
<p>(1) The offeror's proposal shall, at a minimum, address each of the sub factors in (3) below, as they apply to the PWS. Detailed instructions are included in the proposal preparation instructions section of this solicitation. During evaluation of each proposal, the Government<br />will assign each sub factor a rating as shown in table (2) below. A rating of unacceptable in one or more technical sub factors will constitute an overall rating of unacceptable for the technical evaluation and may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>(2) The ratings consist of:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(3) Description of Sub factors:</p>
<p>(a) Sub factor: Long Term Lodging</p>

<p>(c) Sub factor: Proximity to leisure activities Submit a description of amenities within shuttle distance provide by your facility i.e. dinning, malls and recreational facilities.</p>
<p><br />Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to Submit a description of amenities within shuttle distance provided by your facility i.e. dinning, malls and recreational facilities.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the price proposals, and any other relevant proposal data submitted, to determine if proposed prices are reasonable and balanced based on the offeror (s) proposed approach. Price will contribute substantially to the source selection decision, and the source selection will be conducted with the expectation of adequate price competition per FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), therefore, cost or pricing data are not required. However, the offeror may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(1) For the purposes of the initial price evaluation, the offeror shall submit Description of Services CLINS 0001 and 0002. Any other information provided by the offeror will not be considered or evaluated. All proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness. A Total<br />Evaluated Price (TEP) will be presented to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for award decision purposes. The offeror's TEP will be calculated as the sum of the Firm-Fixed-Price CLINs 0001-0002. The Government may use any of the following price analysis techniques IAW FAR 15.404-1(b): comparison of proposed prices received, comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial prices, use of parametric estimating/rough yardsticks, comparison with competitive published price list or market prices, comparison with independent Government cost estimates, comparison with market research, and analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. If the price analysis techniques are<br />insufficient to make a determination of price reasonableness, the contracting officer may request information other than cost or pricing data in order to make a determination of price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(2) To the extent necessary, the Contracting Officer may use other proposal analysis techniques, such as technical analysis and cost analysis to determine price reasonableness. In addition, proposed unit prices will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing (FAR 15.404-1(g)). Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line item appears to be significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. An offeror's proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to<br />the Government. Also a contract will not be awarded to an offeror whose price is not determined reasonable.<br /><br />C. Past Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate past performance to assess how well the offeror performed work relevant to the type of effort and type of requirement described in the solicitation as an indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>The Government will use the following procedures in evaluating past<br />performance:</p>
<p>(1) Recency is defined as performance occurring within the last three (3) years of the date of this solicitation, except that ongoing programs must have begun no less than three (3) months from issuance of the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) The Government will evaluate the relevancy of offeror's past performance and assign ratings of Relevant, or Not Relevant:</p>
<p>PAST PERFROMANCE RELEVANCY DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of<br />effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and<br />magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />(3) The Government will determine how well the contractor performed on past contracts and assign ratings of Acceptable, or Unacceptable:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below)</p>
<p>Unacceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to<br />have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(4) Sources of past performance information for evaluation is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Offeror's shall submit past performance information on at least one (1) but no more than three (3) recent contracts during the past three (3) years from RFP date that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Complete and submit information required in the Addendum to 52.212- 1 of the RFP "Past Performance Information," for each of these contracts.</p>
<p>(b) Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government to include, but not limited to, PPIRS or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee-Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. The past performance evaluation team will review this past performance<br />information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the requirements of this solicitation. See FAR 15.101-2(b)(1) for treatment of past performance relative to small business. Failure to receive an acceptable past performance rating may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>D. After initial evaluation of each offeror's technical and price proposals, and assessment of each offeror's past performance, if the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable past<br />performance assessment rating, award will be made to that offeror without entering into discussions as this represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Offerors shall submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Proposal Preparation Instructions in the Addendum to 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g.,the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past<br />performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Exchanges conducted with regard to adverse past performance or to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions, and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a<br />contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>F. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If the Government elects to hold discussions, a competitive range may be established based on FAR 15.306(c) procedures and this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to further limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If the contracting officer determines that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal will be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offerors in accordance with FAR 15.503. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505 or 15.506.</p>
<p>G. After conclusion of discussions and receipt of final proposal revisions, the Government will make an award to the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) that is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable performance assessment rating, as this represents the best value to the Government.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.

QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 10.  The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply. OFFEROR?S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor?s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term ?working day? excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov. Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.

Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies. In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.

The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website. If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FORDEVELOPMENTAL SINGLE BOARD COMPUTER .  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) intheir quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and awritten amendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions in response to the combinedsynopsis/RFQ that were due April 4, 2012.Questions that were submitted are below along with the answers:Several requirements have been placed on the development SBC that are normally associatedwith higher lever boards or qualification boards and may result in unnecessary cost.Please verify that these requirements are intended for the development board.Q1: Section e.) has a requirement for the development board to withstand randomvibration, this is normally a requirement for qualification for flight boards.A1: This is a workmanship vibration level  no test confirmation is needed but should bebuilt to reasonably be expected to withstand these vibration levels  acceptance levelsare all that is expected for developmental SBC. (e.g. vibration levels expected duringshipping)Q2: Section g.) has a requirement for the development board to meet single eventperformance, this is normally a requirement for flight boards only.A2: We desire to have the development board implement the same fault tolerance techniquesas the flight board, we may consider modifications or limitations to the fault tolerance. The statement Development Board must meet Tier 2 or Tier 3 specifications below meansthat the Development board represents the lower cost, functional representative(equivalent) of a flight board meeting Tier 2 and Tier 3 specifications.Q3: Section f.) has a requirement for the development board to have &gt; 75% equivalentcomponents as the flight board.   This precludes the use of lower cost commercial partson the development board.A3: Our SOW states the difference in a development board is that the parts are greater orequal to 75% functional equivalent but lower grade parts. Industrial grade parts aresuggested, commercial grade are acceptable.Q4: Section  f.) has a requirement for the engineering board to have equivalent partquality as the flight board, normally the engineering board can have lower gradeequivalent parts to the flight board.A4: As stated in the SOW for the Engineering board version: A higher resolution boardthan the developmental board, must be 100% part compatible including part quality,difference being in level of testing and inspection. Testing and certificationdocumentation not required.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.

<DESC>The general dimensions should be 6'x12'x4' for all pieces. The attached drawing is a visual aid only, not for actual dimensions.  But, the overall height will be roughly 24', with a flush manhole cover for access, swift lift for easier placement, and there will be 4 4' extensions that will go between the top and bottom.  The overall height will be approx 24'.  This will facilitate the CERFP doing breaching from the manhole by placing one of our concrete blanks over the hole and breaching through.  We can setup a tripod rescue from the top, and we can also rappel off the sides.  We are looking to build 2 stacks of these.  Just to be clear that would be 2 tops, 2 bottoms, and 8 extensions total. There will be 2 stacks in an L shaped configuration once they are on the ground.   These will need to be delivered to 6350 Howdy Wells Road, LV, which is the Southern Nevada Operators Union site/FEMA TF-1 Rubble Pile.

The reviewing authority for FLCSD is the Director, Regional Contracts Department, Fleet Logistics Center San Diego at 937 North Harbor Drive, San Diego, CA 92132-0060.  Agency procurement protests should clearly identify the initial adjudicating official, i.e., the "contracting officer" or "reviewing official".

The following is a list of minimum requirements that contractors shall comply with for all contracts that may result in the use of a crane for the accomplishment of work.  (a)	The contractor shall notify the contracting officer, in advance, of the intent of bringing a non-Navy owned crane onto a Navy shore installation.  All entries shall be through a prearranged entry point.(b)	The contractor shall comply with the applicable American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards (e.g., B30.5 for mobile cranes, B30.22 for articulating boom cranes, B30.3 for construction tower cranes, and B30.8 for floating cranes).  For barge mounted mobile cranes, a load indicating device, a wind indicating device, and a marine type list indicator readable in one-half degree increments are required.

Parts or components described herein by reference to a manufacturer?s name and/or part number and nomenclature shall be furnished in strict accordance with the manufacturer?s published data relating to said supplies except to the extent otherwise specified in this contract.
Complete interchangeability of parts with original equipment is mandatory. There is insufficient time to obtain and analyze data to insure interchangeability of parts if other than the brand name parts specified are furnished; therefore, bids/proposals offering parts of other than the supplier referenced will be rejected.  The offeror warrants that the parts to be delivered hereunder will be of the part number(s) and the supplier specified.

Questions & Answers pertaning to the requirement:
Q: Is there a fork lift available to unload the shipment when it arrives in San Diego? Is there a staging area to do the assembly and how close is it to the installed location?  A:There's a forklift available and we have a bay with more than enough space for the assembly.  The assembly area will be no more than 50feet from where the lockers will ultimately sit. Q: I had a couple of question about the placement of the lockers. Are the lockers going to be side by side, back to back or individually placed? Are the lockers going to be placed on the ground floor?  A:The lockers will be side by and back to back.  The lockers will be placed on wooden pallets to make it easier for future movement.
Q: does the customer want an expanded metal locker and door with a wire top or do they want   wire panel, sides, top and door with expanded metal shelves? Also if we need 3 evenly spaced shelves are they on one-half of the locker and the other side left open so equipment can hang on the opposite side?A:  The sides of the locker need to be wire panels same as the top; this is to prevent the theft of material in it.  There are 3 spaced shelves on the right side of the lockers so that personnel can put the smaller items while the left side is open for the exception of the rod to use to hang uniforms etc. 

Q: Can  pre-assembled units be included?A: The units can be pre-assembled and we will take care of moving them around the building.
Q: Is it possible to post a drawing of the type of locker/cabinet requested?

<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), is issuing this solicitation, Number D12PS00214 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS). AQD anticipates awarding a single Firm Fixed Price contract to Renovate the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station. The contract will be awarded for a base period of 120 days.  This is an acquisition for commercial products and services and will be conducted using the guidance in FAR 12, FAR 15 and FAR 36. The applicable NAICS code is 237110, "Water and Sewer Line and related Structure Construction". The small business size standard is $33.5 million. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to large and small business concerns.
PURPOSE OF the contractSCOPE OF WORK: As part of its capacity building efforts in Iraq, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Government of Iraq (GOI) to renovate the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture=BFs (IMOA) Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station, located in Wasit province.   This USDA project is being managed by USDA=BFs Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and is part of an overall United States Government effort to build capacity in various areas within the Government of Iraq.  USDA is working to build the capacity of the GOI in agricultural research and extension, as well as other agriculture-related subject areas. In a general Letter of Agreement between the USDA and the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture signed March 3, 2011, USDA and the IMOA agreed to collaborate on the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station.  The Al Sewaira Research Station is located in Wasit province approximately 60 km (35 miles) southeast of Baghdad and covers approximately 150 hectares (375 acres or 625 donums) of fertile land.  It is located approximately 2,150 meters from the Al-Dohan canal, which is its primary source of water for irrigation.  Irrigation water is currently supplied from the canal via an open trench from the Al-Dohan Canal.  The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.  The major problems facing the Station are inadequate water supply, outdated and inefficient irrigation systems, and blockage of drainage pipes.  The renovation of the Station will improve the supply of irrigation water to the Station and improve the irrigation and drainage system used on the Station in order to improve the agricultural research and extension capacity of the Station.  FAS=BF Office of Agricultural Affairs is located in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and is part of the FAS global network of agricultural economists, marketing experts, negotiators, and other specialists stationed in more than 90 countries to support U.S. agricultural interests.  One of the key objectives of the Agricultural Affairs Office is to develop a regionally competitive and sustainable agricultural and food sector in Iraq.USDA has an Agricultural Counselor stationed at the Embassy who serves as the senior USDA official in Iraq.  Also currently stationed there is a USDA Soil and Water Conservation advisor.  The USDA Agricultural Counselor and the USDA Soil and Water Conservation Advisor, or their designees, will be the contractor=BFs USDA points of contact in Iraq.  
The contractor will provide the personnel, labor, supervision, equipment, transportation, and materials needed to fulfill the requirements.  In summary, the contractor shall conduct the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station in Iraq by:
1)	Confirming to USDA in writing through meetings and site visits, all of the equipment, materials and their specifications needed; 
2)	Coordinating with IMOA on the timing for installation of pipes and equipment  to be delivered;

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 001</span><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice PRE-SB1341-12-RP-0019<br /></strong><br />The purposes of this amendment are as follows:
<p>1.	To provide information on the incumbent contractor for this requirement.  The primary incumbent contractor is Booz Allen Hamilton.  Booz Allen Hamilton performed the work as a prime contractor of the Information Assurance Technology Assurance Center (IATAC) contract vehicle administered by the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), which NIST and other agencies have used for the past nine years.</p>
<p>2.	To inform all interested parties that NIST will host a Pre-proposal Conference following the release of the official Request for Proposal (RFP).  This conference will be held at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus.  It is expected that the Pre-proposal Conference will be held approximately one week after the official RFP is released.  Offerors will be allowed sufficient time after the Pre-proposal Conference to prepare and submit their proposals in response to the RFP.  The Pre-proposal Conference is intended to exchange information and resolve concerns involving the requirements, the evaluation criteria, and other aspects of the RFP.</p>
<p>More detailed information, including the official date, time and agenda for the Pre-proposal Conference will be released simultaneously with the official RFP.  However, interested parties who will attend it should anticipate the conference between April 25, 2012 and May 4, 2012.  For interested parties that cannot attend the conference in person, a call-in number will be provided in an amendment to the RFP.</p>
<p>3.	To clarify that NIST may or may not award more than one ID/IQ contract as a result of this RFP.  The quality of the proposals submitted in response to this RFP will dictate whether or not it is in the best interest of the Government to award more than one ID/IQ contract.<br />END OF TEXT.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award.<br><br>This project will remove military munitions and associated munitions debris from approximately nine acres of property associated with past salvage operations managed from building F-33 at Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant.  The task requires removal of surface and subsurface munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), munitions debris (MD) and Material Potentially Possessing an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH); subsequently, the removal of high vegetation and large concentrations of waste and magnetic anomalies that will interfere with the removal work is also addressed.  A preliminary geophysical-aided visual survey of the project site has been performed and assessed to contain Improved Conventional Munitions (ICM).

Justification and Approval
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.   Contracting Activity:
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, for Portland VA Medical Center.

2.   Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
This is a request for a single source award to PR # 648-12-3-069-1371 in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2012.

Urgent and compelling need for Gamunex due to several patients in current therapy requiring the drug within 24 hours in order to continue therapy.  The contract allotment of Gamunex was unavailable as of 7:30am, P.S.T., 2 April 2012 due to the allocation being used up before the facility could place their order.

3.   Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Need s  :
Portland VAMC requires IVIG solution that is sugar free. Several patients are currently in therapy and Pharmacy does not have enough stock to cover all orders after 4/09/12. PO 648-A20161 for $45,324.00.

Line item 1:   Gamunex- C 10%, 10GM, XX Vials @ $XXX/g = $45,324.00

4.   Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is that there is an emergent need with no time for bid.

This product is available as a contract item; however, since NAC has not been able to increase contract supply allocations as yet, a non-contract source had to be acceptable.

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications o r Nature of the Acquisition    Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
The Congaree Group has an established distribution network for pharmaceuticals and has the ability to get us this product by the time required. Several patients are in current therapy cycles, so delivery time is critical. They are certified as a SDVOSB in VETBIZ.gov .

Gamunex-C is the only IVIG product that is sugar free and has to be used to avoid insulin complications in the recipients.

6.   Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as  Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
In accordance with the orders of priority, contracted product was attempted to be purchased but I was told by the pharmacy prime vendor contractor that no more contract product was available for purchase. With two small businesses found that are able to provide the product and meet delivery times this procurement was set-aside for small businesses. 

This is a new process and we are diligently researching additional vendors that can supply this product but due to the emergent need, this order had to be placed today in order to receive product by treatment time.  In the past, other vendors that can supply this product have denied sales to the Portland PVAMC due to no record of purchase history on an allocated product.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
The price provided by Congaree Group is competitive with BDI. In accordance with FAR 13.106-3 (1) Oral quotes were received by vendors.  Due to the urgent need award was made to the lowest price. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
See market research document in file.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
Oregon Pedigree Law prohibits the sale of any pharmaceutical drug from another state into Oregon if the product cannot be tracked to origin.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
Congaree Group is a less expensive supplier of Gamunex-C today.  Pricing of blood products vary according to market fluctuations.

 Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c):

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
