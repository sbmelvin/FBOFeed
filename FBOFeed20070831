Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the maintenance of StoneGate Hardware/Software Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet.  The maintenance listed above is required to support the Departments mission critical operating enviornment and its data from harmful attacks and viruses.  The StoneGate licenses and hardware maintenance aids in the management of the Department's two-tier firewall infrasture.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a solicitation in support of the World Trade Center disaster responders.  Since September 11, 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have been active in assessing the health impact of the World Trade Center disaster. The World Trade Center (WTC) Responder Health Program (RHP) was established to provide eligible WTC responders with health assessment examinations, diagnosis, and focused treatment. NIOSH has established a WTC Responder Health Office (RHO) to oversee the WTC RHP. The RHO intends to secure the services of an experienced third party health care payer, through a cost plus award fee contract, who will work directly with the RHO to provide claims processing and bill payment for all health assessment exams, diagnosis, and focused treatment services to all members and to provide a nationwide pharmacy benefit to all members. At present, there are approximately 37,000 members enrolled in the program. It is estimated that an additional 15,000 WTC responders may enroll in the program over the next two years.  All members are eligible to receive an annual health assessment examination. In addition, approximately 25% of the current 37,000 members are receiving treatment services for physical and mental health conditions related to their exposures during the time of their work at the WTC site.  The Institute anticipates that the period of performance for this effort will be a total of five (5) years, a one (1) year base with four one-year options.  Request for Proposal No. 2007-N-09656 will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition.  The solicitation will be available on or about September 18, 2007.  A pre proposal conference is anticipated on or about October 10th, in New York City, with proposals due on or about October 23, 2007.  Organizations interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may submit a written request to DHHS/PHS/CDC, Contracts Management Branch, P.O. Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070. Written requests for the solicitation documents may be sent to the above address, faxed to (412) 386-6429, or sent via e-mail to dstaudt@cdc.gov.  No telephone requests will be accepted. Solicitation documents will also be available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

AOAC Sole Source Justification

The AOAC Proficiency Testing (PT) Program is the only national A2LA- accredited, food analysis, proficiency testing program available at this time. Programs for food safety analysis include Pesticide Residues in Fruits and Vegetables (P01) and the Standard Microbiology (M01). Proficiency testing is a process for checking actual laboratory performance and is a requirement for accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025:2005. To maintain the laboratories? accreditation, an accredited commercial PT provider must be used if available. Results from proficiency testing are an indication of a laboratory?s competence and are an integral part of the assessment and accreditation process. Laboratories use proficiency testing to test the caliber and quality of the processes, systems, equipment, and personnel used to analyze and test products.
 The Pesticide Residues in Fruits and Vegetables (P01) program provides testing for an extensive array of pesticide residues in a fruit and vegetable matrix. The Standard Microbiology (M01) program helps laboratories prove proficiency in detection of pathogens (including Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, and Listeria), as well as quantifying coliforms, E. coli, Coagulase Positive Staphylococcus, yeast and mold, and aerobic organisms.

<SOLNBR>N0016707Q5300
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), is required by The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (NAVMED P-SOS 5), to maintain a dosimetry program for personnel who receive occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Personnel dosimetry is used to measure an individual’s radiation exposure and to aid in minimizing exposure. Personnel dosimetry has medical, epidemiological and legal significance, and must be conscientiously practiced by trained personnel with the appropriate / approved equipment. The Model 8800 Plus TLD Reader and related parts are Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products which provide personnel dosimetry for the US Navy. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement under FAR 13.5 procedures, with ThermoFisher Scientific Corporation (TSC) — Radiation Measurements and Protection., Santa Fe, NM., for Model 8800 Plus TLD Reader and Related Parts for commercial Thermo Luminescence Dosimetry (TLD) reader systems and materials from ThermoFisher Scientific. A firm-fixed price, five (5) year IDIQ contract is anticipated. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-l(a)(2)(ii), this highly specialized equipment is available only from the original source, Thermo Electron, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. Award to other than TSC would significantly increase the cost of standardization and interchangeability with the Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC) and the NNPP. Changing the equipment source will cause the Navy a substantial increase in costs. Such action would also necessitate procurement of new dosimetry and processing equipment, revisions and rewrites to numerous software programs written by the NDC, establishment of new use and processing policies and procedures, and additional testing to support NVLAP accreditation and to ensure system performance and capabilities compliance. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 09/15/2007 and referencing RFQ N00167-07-Q-5300.  (see note 22)

<DESC>The government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type purchase order for the repair of 4 Mid Range Thermal Imaging (MRTI) units, for Commander First Naval Construction Division (NCD1) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The material is required for NCD1 to provide for the safety of the forward deployed units of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The MRTI (mid range thermal imager) series of imagers are long wavelength (8-12 micron), infrared video cameras intended for use in all weather applications. All MRTI series imagers utilize uncooled technology to produce high quality imagery for high security applications. This type of thermal imager will detect thermal activity in total darkness, through smoke, dust, blowing sand, fog and other obscurants.  These versatile, high performance imagers meet a wide variety of needs in a small, lightweight, military approved package. Straight forward inputs and outputs to the camera provide ease of integration.  This acquisition is in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The Government?s minimum needs have been verified by Certifying technical and requirements personnel.  This requirement is for items solely manufactured by Hurley IR, Mount Airy, MD.  The MRTI is a patented unit and is sold through various distributors.  The only authorized repair facility is the company?s repair branch (Hurley & Associates).  
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 333314.  A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 31 August, 2007.  All responsible sources must submit pricing, factory authorized repair facility letter and past performance data by 2:00 p.m. on the date the offer is due.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

<DESC>We intend to award a sole source contract to Knoll, Inc. for the purchase of furniture components for the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS).  The additional furniture components need to be able to: (a) integrate into the existing Knoll furniture, (b) allow for flexibility when workstations are rearranged and (c) match the current furniture in appearance.  The estimated value will not be disclosed for competition purposes but is less than $550,000.

Justification & Approval - Limited Source

Knoll Component Furniture Parts for
Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies
30 August 2007

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  (10 USC, 2304(c) (1))

Justification
IAW FAR 6.303-2 and 8.405-6(g)


(1)  Contracting Activity:  Department of the Air Force, 15th Contracting Squadron, Specialized Flight (15 CONS/LGCZ), 90 G Street, Building 1201, Hickam AFB, Hawaii  96853.

(2)  Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved:  Justification for brand name purchase for Knoll furniture components for the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS).

(3)  Description of Services Required Meeting the Agency?s Needs:  APCSS requires additional furniture components to complete the outfitting of its workspace.  The additional furniture components need to be able to: (a) integrate into the existing Knoll furniture, (b) allow for flexibility when workstations are rearranged and (c) match the current furniture in appearance.  The estimated value will not be disclosed for competition purposes but is less than $550,000.

(4)  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  IAW 10 USC, 2304(c) (1) ? There is only one responsible source from which the requirement can be met.  The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program IAW Title III of Federal Property and Administrative Services Act & Title 40 USC, 501, Services for Executive agencies. 

IAW FAR 8.405-6(a)(2) ? Item peculiar to one manufacturer and feature is essential to the Government?s requirements, and market research indicates other companies? similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency?s need.

(5)  Demonstration that the Contractor?s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:  FAR 6.302-1(c) provides for use of brand name descriptions when the requirement can only be met by one brand name product.  Knoll is the only manufacturer of the furniture components utilized in the workspace.  Utilizing another manufacturer?s components would require all of the workspace furniture to be replaced.  Use of non-comparable components could cause a safety problem.

The additional systems furniture, including all component parts, will be integrated with existing workstations that were built using Knoll components previously.  The new systems furniture will be located adjacent to and commingled with existing Knoll systems and need to provide a semblance of cohesion by matching with co-sharing panels.

The additional furniture components need to be able to: (a) integrate into the exhausting Knoll furniture, (b) allow for flexibility when workstations are rearranged and (c) match the current furniture in appearance.

(6)  Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable:  IAW FAR 5.202-(a)(6), this acquisition will be ordered against an existing IDIQ under a GSA Schedule and no other offers will be solicited for this requirement.  IAW FAR 8.404(a), placing orders under Federal supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, order activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement.  This requirement will be posted on GSA E-buy as a RFQ.  There are many different offerors with the same equipment; this will ensure that the purchase will be solicited among as many sources as possible.

(7)  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The requirement items/services are commercially available therefore existing market forces support cost reasonableness determination.  The prices quoted are based on GSA contract GS-28F-8029H.  Per FAR 8-404(d) GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.

(8)  Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results:  Market research was conducted by reviewing the Federal Supply Schedules.  Market research indicates that the Knoll component furniture is a unique and not compatible with other system furniture.  The manufacturer is the only source available to purchase the furniture components.  It was determined that no other FSS vendor has furniture on schedule that matches, is interconnectivity, and is compatible with the existing systems furniture.

This requirement is not available for ?full and open competition? based on the need for the Knoll brand name.  A search on GSA Advantage did show the items being requested and that the prices of these items were the same as advertised on GSA.  If a contract is awarded to another source other than Knoll, more cost would be incurred because of furniture components can not be integrated.

(9)  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The use of the Knoll furniture components are essential to APCSS?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  Acquisition of a different brand would cause incompatibility with the existing component furniture. 

(10)  A Listing of the Sources, if any that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

(11)  A Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Services Required:  It is the policy of this office to solicit for full and open competition to the fullest extent possible on all procurements.  The specific requirements can only be met in this situation using other than full and open competition.

(12)  Technical and Requirements Certification:  Based on the aforementioned, I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.


______________________________________			___________________
Robert M. Hogan, Facilities Branch, APCSS					Date

(13)  Contracting Officer Certification:  IAW FAR 6.303-2(a)(12), I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of Other Than Full and Open Competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Approval

In accordance with AFFARS 5306.304, I hereby approve justification to permit other than full and open competition for Knoll furniture components for APCSS.

The Study will analyze the benefits of improved radar coverage, including the ability to predict and respond to the occurrence of natural phenomena.  The Study will recommend the most appropriate technical solution for upgrading and expanding the existing weather radar network in Morocco and will also develop a procurement plan and bidding documents for the recommended technical solution.

The impact of flooding on Morocco in recent years illustrates the need for modernization of the country's monitoring and weather forecast activities.  Accurate weather and flood forecasting is especially important for Morocco because of its strategic location between Europe, Africa and the Middle East, as well as its extended coastline along the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  As a consequence of its sprawling mountainous regions with high precipitation rates, and the presence of a wide valley of lowland watercourses, significant portions of Morocco's territory are subject to frequent flooding.  Because of the insufficiency of appropriate operational monitoring, warning, and forecasting systems, the country suffers recurrent damage from severe storms.  

The proposed Project would result in an effective national system for forecasting environmental crises and the ability to respond to those crises.  An improved radar network would therefore help eliminate and/or minimize the devastating impacts of these natural phenomena.  The system would enable Moroccan authorities to monitor meteorological and flood zone conditions, provide adequate advanced warning to threatened populations and ensure that local, regional, and central authority action and response is coordinated and planned based on the best information available.  Mitigating the catastrophic consequences of Morocco's recurrent cycle of floods and environmental disasters is one of the country's most pressing developmental priorities.  The Weather Radar Network Project also has the potential to help protect the Moroccan economy from disastrous economic shocks imposed by devastating environmental phenomena, particularly in the agricultural sector.  

The Terms of Reference for this Feasibility Study includes:

Task 1:  Kick-off Meeting and Review of Relevant Reports and Data
Task 2:  Station Visits and Diagnosis of all of the Modules of the DMN's Radar Network 
Task 3:  Review Statistics on Recent Climate Related Phenomena
Task 4:  Determination of Equipment Needs
Task 5:  Economic, Financial and Socio-economic Analysis of the Project
Task 6:  Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment
Task 7:  Procurement Plan and Bid Package Preparation
Task 8:  Development Impact Assessment
Task 9:  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <u>9:00AM LOCAL TIME, October 17, 2007</u> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Brand Name basis for the purchase of the item listed below in Description of Supplies.  This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     


This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a Request for Quotation.  The resultant award will be commercial Firm Fixed-Price.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.

The NAICS Code is 423830.  The size standard is 500 employees.  Quotes are being requested on an unrestricted (not set-aside) basis.

IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c (1), as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Descriptions as follows:   

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES 

CLIN: 0001
Description:  Quincy Compressor Model QSI-1250 300HP Rotary Screw Air Compressor rated at 1255 ACFM at 125 psig Full Load Discharge Pressure 460/3/60, Air Cooled; Factory Certified Start-up and Freight.

Quantity:  One (1)

CLIN: 0002
Description:  Furnish all parts, tools, labor, equipment and transportation necessary to install the Quincy model Air Compressor referenced in CLIN 0001.

Quantity:  One (1)

JUSTIFICATION:     

An existing Quincy QSI-1250 air compressor is the source for the shop air used in the blasting process for paint removal of aircraft, aircraft parts, shop tools, and breathing air requirements at the Plastic Media Blasting Unit located in Hangar 61 at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas.  With one Quincy compressor in place, a second unit provides the compatability to run the units parallel to each other, thus creating a more energy efficient blasting operation.  Additionally, having two units of the same make/model saves money in spare parts requirements.  The Quincy compressor runs at a lower RPM resulting in less wear and tear on the unit and increased longevity.  The warranty for the compressor is five years parts and labor versus five years parts only.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure  Precipitation Static Test Sets with the capability of pinpointing airframe bonding issues on the P-3, E-6, and EA-6B aircraft platforms. The current P-STAT Test Sets are used by the Navy for pin-pointing the areas prone to P-Static problems such as:  Fin Caps, Tail Cones, Structural Plates, Antenna Mounting, Inspection Panels, Bonding Straps, Radomes, etc.

The objectives for this procurement are to provide the Navy with portable, ruggedized, lightweight P-STAT Test Sets while satisfying aircraft maintenance needs with a modified commercial variant of the current P-STAT Test Set. The new P-STAT Test Set shall be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified COTS item.

The P-STAT Test Set shall be capable of inducing a localized, high voltage static charge onto the outer skin of the aircraft to simulate actual atmospheric precipitation conditions that occur during aircraft flight. The Test Set shall also be capable of inducing three types of electrical discharge generated by problem areas on the aircraft: Metal-to-Metal Arcing/Sparking, Corona Discharge, and Streamering Effects. The Test Set shall be capable of charging windshields, radomes, and other non-metal surfaces, as well as charging isolated metal sections. Based on the high voltage produced by the P-STAT Test Set, risk of shock or electrocution is a primary concern. The procurement of a common piece of support equipment will allow for configuration control and common operation practices, as well as logistics support.  

The Government intends to procure up to a maximum of (50) P-STAT Test Sets over the life of the contract. The first (3) P-STAT Test Sets shall be pilot production units procured under the first delivery order under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract along with associated technical and logistics data and training. Delivery of the (3) pilot production units and associated technical and logistics data and training will take place within 330 days after date of delivery order award. The pilot production units shall be used for pilot production testing and supportability evaluation/approval testing. Upon completion of contractor pilot production testing and Government suitability/supportability evaluation, up to a maximum of (47) production units may be procured under one or more delivery orders. Delivery of the production units and associated technical and logistics data will take place within 6 months after date of delivery order award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm-fixed price effort.

The contractor shall organize, coordinate, and control all program activities to ensure compliance with the contract requirements and timely delivery of the required products and services. The contractor shall provide necessary system engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the SOW and the Performance Specification.  The FSC Code for this requirement is 6625.

The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website located at http://www.navair.navy.mil on or about 08 MARCH 2007. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The point of contact is: James W. Maxwell, phone: (732) 323-4589, FAX: (732) 323-2359, email: james.w.maxwell@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to negotiate a brand name requirement for Iqeye brand video wall integrated components.  This security equipment is required to assist in SSA?s facility monitoring.  Iqeye brand equipment is required because it has already been integrated into the existing Lenel system within SSA.  The cameras will be supported by the manufacturer as well as Lenel; therefore, a third party integrator will not be required.  This will ensure the facility and personnel are protected and not delayed by unforeseen development problems.  Interested small businesses who feel they can provide a brand of camera other than Iqeye that will fulfill SSA?s needs may respond by submitting their product information via email to Deborah.r.wilson@ssa.gov by COB September 4, 2007.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a brand name or equal procurement.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  A determination by the Government not to solicit brand name or equal equipment based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the closing date (09/04/2007), SSA will proceed with the brand name only solicitation for Iqeye equipment.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 423410.  The size standard for this NAICS code is 100 employees.  All questions and/or submissions to this notice must be submitted in writing to the email address referenced above.  Telephone calls regarding this notice will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.  Responses must reference SSA-RFQ-07-1827.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

SYNOPSIS:  PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERUTILIZED SMALL BUSINESS (HUBZone) FIRMS.  NAICS Code:  236220, Size Standard 31 million.  

The Government intends to secure services, labor, and material for construction, maintenance, and alterations at various buildings and structures at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Glynco, GA, through the issuance of individual delivery orders under an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract.  The Contractor shall furnish, for the basic contract and each individual delivery order issued there under, all labor, transportation, materials, equipment, supervision, and quality control, necessary to perform the required construction, maintenance, and alterations.  The contract duration will be a base period of 12-months from date of award with two (2), 12-month option periods to be exercised at Government discretion.   The contract will have a guaranteed minimum of $100,000.00 with a maximum estimated value of Not-To-Exceed $6,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.  The estimated execution per year for planning purposes is approximately $2,000,000.00 per year.  This is for planning purposes only and is not guaranteed.  Delivery orders will range from $2,000.00 to $500,000.00, and may involve a variety of trades, including carpentry, road repair, roofing, excavation, interior, and exterior electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, concrete masonry, and welding.  The procurement will be solicited using Tradeoff methodology as outlined in FAR Part 15, based primarily on trade-off between present/past performance and price, resulting in the Best Value to the Government.  Offerors will be evaluated on demonstrated ability to manage numerous ongoing projects under a variety of trades simultaneously.  Both relevancy and quality of present/past performance will be evaluated. The Government contemplates award of a firm-fixed price construction contract resulting from this solicitation.

Means Facility Construction Cost Data book, using the sum total of the bare costs adjusted by the Savannah, GA City Cost Index weighted average (the weighted average shall be adjusted quarterly according to the published R. S. Means City Cost Index Quarterly Adjustment), and the contractor coefficient.

The contractor remains responsible for checking the website regularly for the solicitation and subsequent amendments.

The company shall be certified to perform waterborne weight testing.  Certification must accompany offerors bid.  Since fleet readiness is the critical path under this action, an equal product would require extensive technical review to determine its comparability and integration capability into the existing equipment configurations.  The Cape Johnson training vessel and Landship training platform are equipped with cargo booms that require periodic weight testing to ensure safe operation during cargo handling evolutions. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 423440. The proposed RFQ N00189-07-T-0472 will be posted on or before 27 August 2007 with a response date of 31 August 2007.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 332311   MODULAR BUILDING FOR USE AS A METROLOGY LABORATORY Amendment #2 answers to technical questions received, a drawing revision and two added Quotation Instructions.  Technical Questions and Answers  RFQ-OH-07-00157 (Modular Building EPA NFVFL Ann Arbor, MI) Question 1.   How tall are the upper level walls? Answer:  SOW paragraphs 11.3 and 11.5 define the height of the Second floor office walls.  The walls of the existing clean room second floor office are approximately 9?-2?.  As stated in the SOW the contractor is responsible for verifying all dimensions and  creating shop drawings to fit. Question 2.  Do the windows need to match the wall specs concerning pressure? Answer:  Yes, the windows need to meet the specifications concerning pressure.  If the walls exceed the specifications the windows do not need to be the same.  As a clarification on the Lab  Positive Pressure:  The Lab shall be able to withstand the structural forces of a positive pressure of 0.2 inches of water (0.0072 psig). Question 3.  Who is responsible for unloading materials from trucks upon delivery? Answer:  As stated in SOW paragraph 3.4 "The contractor shall be responsible  for delivery and in plant moving and storage of all materials. Should the government assist the contractor in any in plant moving or storage of material, the contractor shall be responsible for any damage to the materials." Question 4.  Will the EPA provide lift equipment (e.g.) fork lift &  scissors lift? Answer:  The EPA has two electric fork lifts with 4000 lb capacity and one scissor lift, that a contractor may use when available.  Contractors must be licensed for the use of the fork-lifts and the scissor lift and must wear proper safety equipment.  Availability of the lifts is not  guaranteed.  EPA employees and in-house contractors have first priority for use of the lifts. Question 5.  Does the ?" plywood flooring need to be fire retardant? Answer:  As stated in SOW paragraph 3.6 "The contractor is responsible for meeting all code requirements".  For code purposes the 2nd  floor is an office with less than 50 persons. Question 6.  What sound reducing material is required for the 2nd floor? Answer:  The building Sound transmission class is specified in SOW paragraph 4.7.2.  No special sound reducing material is specified for reducing noise transmitted from the 2nd  story floor to the 1st floor office and lab. Question 7.  Will the EPA remove any obstructions, (e.g.) pipes, ect.? Answer:  The EPA is responsible for removing obstructions such as pipes, wires, and HVAC ductwork within the 3-D space of the structure as shown on the EPA drawing.  If the  contractor will need additional obstructions moved to facilitate construction, those shall be identified in the quotation.  Question 8.  Is the second floor bridge part of this project?  If so - need specs. Answer:  The second floor bridge is part of the project.  The bridge is described in  paragraph 5.3 of the SOW.  The 42? dimension in paragraph 5.3 shall read as approximately 39?.  The load rating in paragraph 5.6 also applies to the bridge. Question 9.  Section 4.8--- The column to carry the 32' W18x35 I-Beam will need to be a 3"x3"x3/16" Steel Tube, Panels can be split into 2'  sections to allow a location for a post/electrical chase. Answer:  SOW Paragraph 4.5 specifics "Standard panels shall be designed for 48? on center spacing."Offerors shall indicate in its quotation which post will allow for an electrical chase and which will not. Question 10.  Section 5.12---The  support columns for the catwalk will be exposed against the existing sturcture, as the load bearing capability of the adjoining wall cannot be verified. A structural engineer may be able to sign off on this if he knows all the details of the situation. Answer:  Exposed posts are not allowed.  A  cantilevered design may be quoted if the contractor identifies/verifies the existing build will not support the load. Question 11.  Section 5.13--- Is a 22ga steel roof deck acceptable? Answer:  The specification in the SOW is for a 20ga minimum.  An offeror may propose other sizes, but must  address how this will effect loading, flexing, and sound transmission between floors in the quotation. Question 12.  Section 5.3---Is the "Ceiling" referred to actually the Top of Deck or the actual drop ceiling height? Answer:  The "Ceiling" referred to in paragraph 5.3 can be considered the "Top  of Deck".  The requirement refers to the finished floor height of the second floor of both buildings. Question 13.  Section 5.8---The maximum I-Beam width is spec'd out at 16", however a W18x35 I-Beam will be required to span 32' at 125PSF Deck loading.

Answer:  The PO conducted market research and feels that the 16" requirement (as stated in the Specifications) can be met.  An offeror may submit an option in its quotation, for 18" beams. Question 14.  What is the Top of Deck Dimension of the Existing Cat  Walk? Answer:  See SOW paragraph 5.2.  As stated in the SOW the contractor is responsible verifying all dimensions and creating shop drawings to fit. Question 15.  What is the overall height of the finished building need to clear? Answer:  Paragraph 11.3 states:  The roof of the second floor  office shall be positioned to provide at least 6" clearance below the Large Soak roof support structures.   Question 16.  Section (4.6.3) Please clarify if an offeror shall describe how an electrician shall connect to the walls, in order to ground them? Answer:  An offerors quotation shall  describe how the metal of the wall panel can be connected to ground by the EPA onsite electrician.  Examples would be using a sheet metal screw, connect to a panel stud, or the panels are self grounded through the frame. Question 17.  Is it possible to have 8' spans instead of 4' spans for roof  trusses? Answer:  Yes, all other requirements must be met including concrete loading.  Question 18.  Can the contractor have a dumpster on site? Answer:  Yes, the contractor may bring a dumpster on site.  The contractor may use the EPA's metal recycling dumpster, provided material is broke down  sufficiently. Question 19.  Can the contractor use a propane forklift in the building? Answer:  No Question 20.  Is this a prevailing wage contract? Answer:  No, prevailing wages are not applicable.     Question 21.  Is this an IPO (In-Plant-Office) or a stand alone building? Answer:  Yes, this  building will be inside our lab, hence the title of the procurement "Metrology Laboratory In Plant Modular Building SOW" Question 22.  5.8 is this to be a clear span, or can support columns be in the room?   Answer:  As stated in SOW paragraph 5.5, "The contractor shall clear span all rooms. Posts  will only be allowed in walls." Question 23.  Regarding the existing landing that is connected to the existing office and platform.  We understand that the landing will need to be lowered and we need to verify the required landing height. Answer.  The contractor is responsible for determining the  proper landing height and stair rise needed to build a code compliant stairway.  For information only the existing mezzanine office finished floor is approximately 99 inches.  As stated in the SOW the contractor is responsible verifying all dimensions and creating shop drawings to fit. Drawing  Revision:  It was decided by the NVFEL to move both windows in room 330C (Metrology Lab drawing page 1 of 2) from the location shown on the drawing to the North-East corner of the room.  The window specifications have not been revised, only the window location for room 330C.  The drawing will be  updated after award of the purchase order, but before work commences. Quotation Instruction Additions 8.  An offerors quotation shall indicate the estimated rate of leakage in cubic feet per minute when the room is at a positive pressure 0.2 inches of water.   9.

In addition this effort requires the operation and maintenance of the Simulator Operating System, Data Acquisition System, and DTRA-owned hardware associated with the Pulserad 1150 simulator.  Results derived from these activities shall be captured through comprehensive documentation.  DTRA will not pay the contractor for these services.  These services will be funded by customer test fees.  The contractor shall operate and maintain DTRA?s x-ray simulator capabilities to support customer testing.  This may include, but is not limited to, providing engineering and scientific support to test customers; assisting in test design, data collection and analysis; performing routine maintenance and repairs on DTRA simulators; maintaining an adequate stock of spare parts and an active inventory control system; keeping detailed configuration control records of changes to simulators; performing upgrades to simulators to meet near-term test customer requirements; maintaining an archive of test data; operating and maintaining the simulator control system and data acquisition system; and facility security and Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) programs.  In exchange for these services the contractor will be permitted to use the above Government Property (GP) to perform contracts separately with federal agencies, defense contractors, and commercial businesses to provide test support, test time, and upgrades.  The DTRA Simulator Program has provided test support to numerous weapon and satellite system customers.  Past customers have included the Air Force MILSTAR, Small ICBM, B1 Bomber, Minuteman III, Army Pershing Missile and THAAD; and the Navy Trident Program.  Current customers include the Air Force Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) satellites; Navy/Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Trident Life Extension and SNL Stockpile Stewardship Programs. Emerging weapon system program offices that have expressed an interest in testing at the DTRA simulator facilities include the Air Force Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS), Transformational Satellite (TSAT), the Trident/Minuteman III Replacement ICBM and the MDA exo-atmospheric and multiple kill vehicle systems.  In addition to providing test environments for survivability testing, DTRA simulators have been used to validate a substantial number of Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) models and associated effects.  These computer models are an integral part of the survivability validation process and provide the system developer with a cost effective way of designing survivability into their system before hardware fabrication has started.  The list of codes and models validated on DTRA models is substantial.  Some of the model and code phenomena that DTRA Simulators have been used to validate include internal EMP, Circuit Response, Photocurrents, Thermal Structural Response, System Generated EMP, Combined Thermal Loading, Device Physics, Transient Radiation Electronic Effects, Material and Structural Response and Space and Ground System Effects and Assessment.
The subject contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (L-3 Communications, Titan Corporation) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Contract award is anticipated for 21 December 2007.  This synopsis does not constitute an invitation for bids (IFB) or a request for proposals (RFP) and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government.  GPE numbered note 22.

<DESC>National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Acquisition & Grants Office (AGO), Mountain Region Acquisition Division (MRAD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),  with the University of California for  the exchange of scientific expertise and data. This scientific exchange of research and data includes research in the light absorption by atmospheric aerosols on board the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Research Vessel Knorr.  The data will be acquired using NOAA furnished photo-acoustic aerosol absorption spectrometer (PAS) and a cavity ring-down aerosol extinction spectrometer (CRDS).  The PAS for measuring soot (absorbing aerosols) was developed at NOAA in Boulder and it requires intimate knowledge of the workings of the instrument to accomplish these measurements.  The measurements of light absorption will be made both along the northeast coast of the United States and in the Norwegian, Greenland and Barents Seas in the Arctic. 
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE 100K).  This notice is issued for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  The instrumentation to be used in this study is extremely delicate and intricate and there is no other source available with the knowledge and ability to perform the study.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to NOAA's program may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR INSTRUMENT INCUBATOR PROGRAM  - CLARREO MISSION
<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for the Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) for risk reduction on the CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory) National Research Council's (NRC) Decadal Survey Mission –  Background - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH07ZDA001N, Appendix A.26 Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) (Amendment No. 15) on July 24, 2007.  The NRA and Appendix can be accessed at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={E529A93E- C05F-7B1E-680D-D5C7488C2F6C}&path=open.   The IIP fosters the development of innovative instruments and measurement techniques and their assessment in ground, aircraft, or engineering model demonstrations. It is designed to reduce the risk of new, innovative instrument systems so that they can be successfully used in future science solicitations.  The 2007 IIP specifically focuses on the instruments and techniques required to make the science measurements that are described in the decadal survey (Reference:  Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, ISBN: 0-309-66900-6 (2007) or access a free pdf download from http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html). Measurements called for in the decadal survey have been assembled into mission concepts with start dates ranging from 2010 to 2020.  CLARREO is a recommended mission for joint implementation by NASA & NOAA during the timeframe of 2010 to 2013. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from industry, academia, non-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and other government agencies to participate in developing a proposal addressing the goals and objectives of the IIP, specifically focusing on the CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory) mission requirements.   LaRC is seeking potential partner(s) for science instrumentation development  with expertise in all of the following areas: (a) compact, long-life, moderate resolution interferometers for infrared spectra; (b) optical design and analysis of interferometers; (c) detector technologies over the range of wavelengths relevant to thermal infrared (4 um to 100 um) operating at kilohertz frequencies; (d) broad bandpass (4 um to 100 um) beamsplitters; (e) implementation of techniques for meeting rigorous instrument calibration requirements including development and implementation of SI-traceable standards;(f) high emissivity blackbodies; and (g) validation and verification capability of sensor overall performance, (possibly including suborbital flight demonstrations).  It is expected that selected partner(s) will work with NASA Langley Research Center scientists and engineers to jointly develop and demonstrate prototype sensors capable of meeting the measurement objectives of the CLARREO mission defined in the NRC Decadal Survey.   This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts or other agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates.   Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence of successful participation in similar developments should be included. Resumes are also requested, but will not count against the total allotted page count of 8.      (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ ability to control both cost and schedule. The ability of the proposer to complete projects on time and within the modest, fixed budgets that are characteristic of the Instrument Incubator Program is key. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.    3) Cost sharing. The IIP encourages cost sharing.  This criterion evaluates the extent and type of cost sharing proposed and the potential partner’s commitment to do so.  (4) Facilities. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task.  Instrument test facilities for thermal vacuum testing of spaceflight prototypes areas are considered important to this opportunity.  The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.	    NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members.  SPECIAL NOTICE: Interested proposers are invited to participate in an exchange of information with the Principal Investigator, Dr. Martin Mlynczak, on Friday, September 7, 2007, at 1:00 PM EST.	Dr. Mlynczak will provide an overview of relevant technical work performed to date, and discuss the requirements of this opportunity.   Time will be allotted for a question and answer session as well.  Interested participants must contact Rosemary Baize at 757-864-7157 in order to obtain the teleconference number and to be added to the WEbEx contact list.  All technical questions must be submitted via e-mail, as well, to Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to eight (8) pages (exclusive of resumes) in not less than 12-point font.  Responses must address each of the aforementioned evaluation criteria.   All responses shall be submitted to LaRC via e-mail by 5:00 PM EST on September 14, 2007 to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- SSA Electronic Evidence Gathering Prototype
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTE TO:  Healthcare Providers, EHR Software Vendors, and HIT Software Services Vendors:  Health Information Technology Prototype THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS POSTING.

INTRODUCTION:  The Social Security Administration requests medical evidence to support the disability claims process.  Today, requests for medical evidence, along with the authorization to release information, are sent to the healthcare provider via mail or fax. In turn, healthcare providers have multiple channels (mail, fax, web, and secure electronic transmission) to respond back to SSA with the medical evidence. 

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is interested in initiating a prototype project in the electronic exchange of standardized health information with healthcare providers.  The objective of the project will be to evaluate the feasibility, technical alternatives, and potential value of leveraging electronic communication along with structured clinical information with healthcare providers for the disability claims process.  A provider-based EHR may provide responses to electronic requests from SSA using standard electronic transactions transmitting structured clinical information, which could result in quicker decisions on disability claims. 

SSA is interested in hearing from any healthcare providers, EHR vendors and/or technology partners that are interested in discussing this approach, alternative concepts, and opportunities to partner in this prototype.  SSA requests that all responders include a brief description of their area of interest and their capabilities associated with the subject matter of this notice.  Please submit your response directly to Debbie Somers at Debbie.somers@ssa.gov.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH
  AERIAL SUPERVISION MODULES (ASM)

Contracting Office:  

Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), 3833 South Development Avenue, Boise, ID  83705-5354

NAICS CODE:  532411

Description:

The USDA Forest Service is contemplating an upgrade of its aerial supervision fleet of airplanes utilized for initial attack, extended attack, and lead plane functions on wildfires.  The purpose of this request for information is to conduct market research to determine if there are commercial airplanes (with or without modifications) available in the marketplace to fulfill the aerial supervision module performance requirements within reasonable pricing parameters, which may ultimately result in the issuance of a solicitation of competitive proposals for the dry lease of approximately 10 airplanes (with a possible increase of up to 20 airplanes), of the same model from a single vendor.  The airplanes will be operated by Government employee pilots and fuel for the airplanes will be purchased by the Government.  The airplanes will be maintained by the contractor/vendor.  
  
The following is a list of the basic minimum requirements needed for aerial platforms to fulfill the aerial supervision mission:

-	Airplanes must be turbine powered.
-	Must be equipped with basic Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) equipment as defined by the FAA.
-	Minimum flight endurance is 4 hours.
-	Single or Multi-engine.
-	Certified for Single Pilot by the FAA.
-	Dual controls.
-	Avionics:  The airplanes must be capable of having the following standard avionics included in the airplanes:  Glide Slope/Localizer, Two VHF-AM 760 Channel Communication/Navigation radios, Low Frequency Receiver, Transponder, IFR Approach Certified Global Positioning System, IFR Certified Autopilot, VHF-AM, Three Audio Selection Panels, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Advisory and Warning System (TAWS), Collision Avoidance System, and Cockpit Voice Recorder.  
-	The ability to add visibility enhancements to make the airplanes highly visible from ground to air and air to air (i.e., color and/or high intensity lighting).
-	Air Conditioning.
-	Demonstrated ability to deal with particulates/smoke found in the air environment over fires.
-	Certificated by the FAA to operate in known icing conditions and to operate in day and night Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
-	Meet the Federal Acquisition Act implementation of the Buy American Act and its exceptions for Government acquisition of airplanes.
-	Airplanes must be in current production or nearing current production; or if not in current production, a minimum of 400 airplanes must have been produced with a production of date not in excess of ten (10) years from the date of the potential date of a new ASM contract award and with no more than 2,000 total airframe time.
-	Airplanes must have been completely built by the manufacturer, i.e., no kit airplanes.
-	Minimum Flight Deck capacity of two.
-	Minimum cruise speed of 230 Knots True Airspeed (KTAS).
-	Minimum maneuvering speed (Va) of 150 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS).
-	Maximum stall speed (Vso) of 90 KIAS.
-	Minimum Single Engine Service Ceiling of 12,500 ft. msl.

The airplanes have the potential to be operated at altitudes less than 500 feet above ground level, in mountainous terrain, with the normal turbulence associated with the wildfire environment.  

Interested parties wishing to participate in this market research may provide relative information and/or brochures for airplanes that meet or exceed the above mission requirements to the following address, by September 14, 2007:

<SUBJECT>R -- PROCESS IMPROVEMENT FOR SAMHSA OPERATIONS BASED ON THE NIATx MODEL
<SOLNBR>07M000179
<RESPDATE>091207
<ARCHDATE>09272007
<CONTACT>Raleigh Tanner, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-260-8856, Fax 202-690-6630, Email rtanner@psc.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Acquisitions Management posts this solicitation for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  SAMHSA requires a contractor that shall provide consultation that will support the direction and supervision of a SAMHSA Process Initative.  The statement of work is as follows:

Background:
The approach to SAMHSA's internal process improvement will be based on the model developed by the Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx), a partnership between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Paths to Recovery program, SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment's Strengthening Treatment Access and Retention (STAR) program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and a number of independent addiction treatment organizations. NIATx works with addiction treatment providers to make more efficient use of their capacity and shares strategies for improving treatment access and retention.
In April 2007, SAMHSA's Administrator requested an internal assessment of SAMHSA core functions in order to identify opportunities to improve SAMHSA operating systems. The assessment was conducted on April 9, and 10 and identified two functions: grant making and controlled correspondence review and approval that could be the initial focus for process improvement efforts to gain efficiency and clarity. The assessment also identified a series of next steps including: finalize aim, establish measures, idea testing, outside review, change leader and executive sponsor selection, testing ad tracking.

Statement of Work:
A.   Purpose/General Objective:
The purpose of this request is to obtain ongoing consultation that will support the direction and supervision of a SAMHSA Process Initiative. Similar to the work done under the NIATx Model, the Initiative will focus on improving the systems used to organize and conduct work, but at every available opportunity will address the styles and methods of communication used to facilitate work and the arrangements and amenities that house and support work.  The project is viewed in an 18-month time frame beginning in August 2007 through December 2008.
The initiative will focus on two systems that were most frequently discussed during the April assessment as presenting opportunities for improvement: 
1.   Controlled correspondence review and approval.
Controlled correspondence is the umbrella term used to review and sign off on several different categories of  functions, including but not limited to: external correspondence from constituents, Congress and the Department; internal policy practices; policies, standard, and notices  for 'public consumption' developed by an operating center; all critical steps in the 'grant making process'. Controlled correspondence of all types is managed by a single point of control (the Executive Secretary), who assigns and determines the particular path, and process any particular piece of paper will follow.  The themes described above emerge in positive and negative consequences in the review and sign off systems. Most commonly cited were instances of refusal to sign or 'disapproval' with comment signatures as a manifestation of previously unresolved differences.
2.   Grant making 
Grant making is the umbrella term used for the range of activities starting with, and not limited to: a  new program concept originating in an operating center;  budget programming, approval;  Request for Application (RFA) development and dissemination; grant review and recommendation; and 'funding package' approval,  stages of grant making. Each of these stages in the grant making process is comprised of multiple and overlapping 'systems' to complete the work. There is early interest in focusing on the RFA development and grant review stages of the process.
B.   Specific Objectives:
This initiative will start with the controlled correspondence system, and add the selected stage of the grant making systems to the project within 2 months (There will be 2 overlapping projects). Specific objectives are as follows:
1. Finalize the aim.  At the close of the April assessment, the overall aim of the SAMHSA Process Improvement Initiative appeared to be in a direction that would respectfully, streamline and un-bunch the grant making and exec sec review and approval processes.  This aim will be revisited during the initial meetings with the Administrator and leadership team to ensure continued agreement and support.  
2. Measures will be developed to quantify progress toward these overall aims.  These measures will be simple, easy to collect, and effectively reflect progress toward the aims.
3. Messaging.  The overall aim and measures will be tailored to convey their meaning in a clear and motivating manner.  A communication strategy will be developed to ensure that all staff are aware of them and the plans to achieve them.  In addition an 'elevator speech' will be created to rapidly and effectively communicate the essence of what this initiative is about.
4. Executive Sponsor.  SAMHSA will identify an Executive Sponsor who possesses the commitment, influence and insight necessary to lead the overall Initiative. This senior leader will be the primary point of contact for the Offeror.
5. Project selection.  Within the broad aims of grant making and controlled correspondence review and approval, two specific projects will be selected to start.  For instance, in grant making it might be to respectfully streamline and un-bunch the grants review process.  And within the correspondence area, the selection might await a subdivision into communication types.  
6. Rapid Cycle Deadlines.  The leadership team will work with the Offeror to establish near term deadlines to make progress on each of these project areas.  
7. Change Leader. A senior leader should be appointed to lead the overall initiative.  This person should be influential and have the Administrator?s confidence and support.  In addition a person should be appointed to lead the two project areas.  It is very important that both enthusiasm for the topic and influence should be characteristics of the Change Leader.  The Change Leader will have the responsibility for making change and improvement happen in their areas.  They will form a cross functional Change Team of SAMHSA staff to support them that has an equivalent level of enthusiasm for improving the process and brings needed expertise, energy and knowledge to the project.  
8. Process review.  The Offeror will set up and facilitate a walk-through for the Change Leader, Change Team, and Executive Sponsor of each process being examined. In the case of correspondence, this might entail following a piece of correspondence through arrival to departure; for grant review it might involve bringing together a group of people familiar with the process (including the person who receives the results of the grants review) to create a flow chart describing what happens during this process and the time it takes to do each step. During this process, participants will be asked for their ideas about things that might be done to improve the process. 
9. Outside review.  Proposal review and correspondence review and approval are common tasks in a wide variety of industries.  The Offeror will conduct a rapid identification (via literature review or interview) of organizations that are high performers on project and correspondence review and approval followed by a rapid analysis of how these high performers carry out these functions. 
10. Idea selection and testing.  Using this outside review and a simultaneous search for ideas inside SAMHSA, the Offeror (drawing on advice from the team and others) should select an improvement idea that can be tried very quickly and has potential to substantially improve the process.  One (no more) measure of the effectiveness of that idea will be identified and a rapid cycle test established and implemented.
11. Communication campaign.  As much as one would hope that the benefits of a particular change would be identified immediately, it is important that a communication program be initiated to demonstrate to the staff the progress that has been made. This communication is an integral part of ?managing the expectations, and let downs? inevitably associated with the injection of consultants who come into an organization and ask questions about performance and outcomes. 
12. Bundling.  Just as in any field it is likely that not one, but a bundle of several changes will be needed to dramatically improve a complex process.  The Offeror will identify and document other areas of needed change.  
Tasks to be Performed:
The consultation includes the following tasks:
1.Development of a detailed 18-month Project Plan with timelines, identified task leads, and clear measures for tracking success.
2.Planning for, arranging, participating in, and providing an analysis of a series of walk through exercises for at least two internal SAMHSA processes for the Change Team and leadership group to understand the customer experience.
3.Quarterly progress assessment briefings with the Administrator, senior staff and the broader SAMHSA leadership team.
4.Regular conference calls with the designated Change Leader to address progress and implementation of the process improvement initiative.
5.Onsite meetings with Change Leader and Change Teams.
6.Continuous provision of articles, material, resources from outside the industry that inform and support the work of the team.
7.Arrangement of at least one off site visit for the Change Team to an external industry that performs similar functions (e.g. a private foundation or a corporate CEO (re controlled correspondence) for bench marking purposes.
8.Ongoing technical assistance and recommendations re: measurement of progress, and measurement of change cycles, internal team and external agency communication; change cycle intervals, and change cycle interventions. 

Schedule of Deliverables 

1.18-month Project Plan:  The Project Plan will be proposed four weeks from award.  The final project plan is due one week after comments received from GPO.  
2.Walk Through:  The contractor shall plan for, arrange, participate in, and provide an analysis of walk through exercises for two internal SAMHSA processes within 90 days of contract award.   
3.Quarterly Process Assessments:  Shall include a summary of progress to date, problems that have arisen or are foreseen, suggested or implemented solutions, and preliminary data as available.  Assessments are due one week after the end of the first three quarters of the first contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation shall not be issued.  This solicitation number 08X800200 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, 2005-19, dated August 17, 2007.  This RFQ is to provide automobile rental services to various agencies and employees of the Department of Health and Services (DHHS).  The period of performance shall be base year, plus 4 ? 12 month option periods.

Background:  The Government is seeking to continue use of a commercial form to provide vehicles for use by its employees with a minimum of administrative effort.  The Government wants to continue operating in that manner.  We foresee one ordering point at each activity, and a single billing office, however the Government retains the right to change the number of ordering offices.  The DHHS has an irregular requirement for the use of small, and mid-size vehicles, ?mini-vans,? and 15 passenger vans for use between sites in the general DC metropolitan area.  Occasional travel is required to the Baltimore and Philadelphia metropolitan areas.  However, out of state travel may be required but such travel is the exception.  In addition, overnight travel is required on an infrequent basis.

Requirement:  The duration of the rental is generally for one business day and is not expected to exceed 15 vehicles at any one time.  The Government does not guarantee any minimum of daily business for the Contractor.  Vehicle distribution may not be balanced through the four classes available under the proposed contract.

The Contractor shall deliver vehicles to the sites identified below.  A secure parking place will be provided for ordered vehicles delivered.  The Government will provide a secure, perpetually staffed desk at which the Contractor can deposit keys and paperwork for the driver to pick up when travel commences.  The Government will, in no case, be responsible for returning rental agency personnel to their work site.  The customer will deliver vehicles to the secure area at the end of the rental period for pickup by the rental agency prior to 8:00 AM the next business day.  In all cases, rental vehicles shall have all required documentation, such as a copy of the contract and registration, with the keys.  The vehicle will be available for immediate departure by the traveler.

Vehicle drop off points include:

	Program Support Center	   National Institutes of Health
	5600 Fishers Lane	   1 Center Drive
	Rockville, MD 		   Bethesda, MD
	Visitor?s Parking Lot/PKLN Dock	B1 Parking Lot

	Food and Drug Administration	HHS Headquarters
	10903 New Hampshire Avenue	200 Independence Ave S.W.
	Silver Spring, MD 		Washington, DC
	Visitor Parking Lot		C Street side of Bldg.

	Personal Property Facility
	16071 Industrial Drive
	Gaithersburg, MD 
	Visitors Parking Area

	Drop off spots for keys will be formally designated after contract award.

	Vehicles must be cleaned, fully fueled, and serviced prior to successive rentals.

Unlimited mileage is required in each rental case.  The Contractor shall refuel all vehicles.  A review of pricing for fuel shall be accomplished during the third month of each quarter, beginning with the second full quarter in the first performance period.  In conducting fuel price review, the Government will survey no less than 5 commercial fueling stations in Rockville and will determine an average per gallon price for 87-octane fuel.  Fuel prices charged by the Contractor shall not exceed that average.

The first performance period will begin upon award and continue through September 30, 2008.  There will be four additional 12-month option periods.

The Government will notify the Contractor prior to noon the business day before rental vehicles are required.  The notification to the Contractor will include the number and types of vehicles, the location of the drop off and the earliest time that the vehicle can be dropped off.  The rental period shall not commence earlier than the time identified in the notification for drop off.

Clean, licensed, insured and well maintained vehicles, delivered on time, to the locations designated will be key performance metrics. 

Authorized Drivers:  All licensed Government employees in the vehicle shall be authorized to drive the rental vehicle, unless individually restricted by the operator?s license.

Liability and other insurance:  Government personnel will not be subject to any fee for loss to the vehicle for Collision Damage Waiver, and, in the case of an accident, will not be responsible for loss or damage to the vehicle, except as stated below.

The Contractor shall maintain in force, and at its sole cost, insurance coverage or a duly qualified self-insurance program, which will protect the United States and its employees against liability for personal injury, death and property damage arising from each use of a vehicle.  Personal injury/wrongful death limits shall be equal to the highest minimum for the state and/or District of Columbia in which the vehicle operates during each rental.  The conditions, restrictions and exclusions of the applicable insurance for any rental shall not be less favorable to the Government and its employees that the coverage afforded under standard automobile liability policies.  Where more favorable terms are available, those terms shall be automatically extended.

Standard coverage shall include mandatory no-fault insurance where required by law.  The Contractor warrants that to the extent permitted by law, the liability and property damage coverage provided are primary in all respects to other sources of compensation, including claims statutes or insurance available to the Government, renter or additional authorized driver.  Proof of such insurance shall be provided.

The Contractor assumes and shall bear the entire risk of loss or damage to the rented vehicles (including costs of towing, administrative costs, loss of use and replacements), from any and every cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, casualty, collision, fire, upset, malicious mischief, vandalism, tire damage, falling objects, overhead damage, glass breakage/cracking/chipping, strike, civil commotion, theft and mysterious disappearance, except where such loss and/or damage is caused by one or more of the following:

	a.   An accident due to negligence on the part of a Government driver, where there is credible
	      evidence of such negligence, such as a police report citing the driver for a traffic violation.
	b.   Obtaining the vehicle through fraud or misrepresentation
	c.   Operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol or any prohibited drugs
	d.   Use of the vehicle for illegal purposes
	e.   Use of the vehicle in pushing or towing another vehicle
	f.    Using or permitting the vehicle to be used for hire
	g.   Operating the vehicle in any training maneuver or for any purpose other than that for which
	       vehicles of this type are normally rented by a private citizen
	h.   Operating the vehicle in a test, race or contest of any kind
	i.    Operating of the vehicle by an unauthorized driver
	j.    Operating outside of the United States unless specifically authorized at the time of rental
	k.   In the event the vehicle is stolen and the renter cannot produce keys to the vehicle, unless
	      a formal police report indicates the keys were stolen through some form of theft or robbery
	l.   Operation of the vehicle off paved, graded and professionally maintained roads or driveways

Vehicles:  The vehicles shall be well maintained, insured, properly licensed and clean for each use.  All vehicles shall meet all state and local safety standards, shall be no more than two years old and will have no more than 40,000 miles on the odometer at the time of pickup by the employee.  The vehicle shall have a full gas tank at the time of rental, minus whatever gas is consumed in moving directly from the rental location to the drop off point.  Such fuel usage is expected to be negligible.  It shall be the Contractor?s responsibility to refuel all rented vehicles.

The Contractor shall provide renters with a 24-hour telephone number for reporting accidents, disabled vehicles and for requesting a replacement vehicle, if necessary.  Inoperative rental vehicles within 25 miles of any of the listed ?Drop Locations? shall be replaced within one hour.  The renter of a vehicle involved in an accident shall, in all cases, file a police report and provide a copy of that police report to the rental agency and the Government Project Officer.  Renters shall, in addition, complete a rental company accident report, if so requested.

Liaison:  The Government will appoint a Vehicle Transportation Office (VTO).  The incumbent(s) in that office will order vehicles, negotiate changes in fuel costs and administer the contract.  The Contractor shall also appoint a Liaison Officer with responsibility for managing this effort.

Pricing:  Vehicle rates shall operate through the performance period.  The Contractor may, at the Contractor?s own initiative lower prices or offer special rates that are available to consumers, but may not increase prices.

Offerors are advised that award for this solicitation shall be made in the aggregate (all or none). Technical literature, warranty details, and delivery schedule must be submitted for all products offered for the Government to perform a technical evaluation. No further request will be made to obtain required information and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration. Award will be made relative to best overall value.  Best value will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all minimum specifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision. Solicitation responses must contain offerorâ€™s prompt payment discount terms (if any), proposed delivery schedule, and warranty terms. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluationâ€”Commercial Items; (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is set-aside for small business only. The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is 333314, with a size standard of 500 employees. Solicitation/Purchase Request number 52-2007NA28232.000 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 effective 30 June 2007.  The Government intends to award five contract line item numbers (CLINs) for Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Lights (ATPIALs) as follows: CLIN 0001) Fifteen (15) ea Insight Technology ATPIAL high power LA-5/PEQ or equal; CLIN 0002) Option - Minimum one (1) ea to a maximum of fifteen (15) ea Insight Technology ATPIAL high power LA-5/PEQ or equal; (during option period Oct. 1, 2008 â€“ Sep. 30, 2009); CLIN 0003) Option - Minimum one (1) ea to a maximum of fifteen (15) ea Insight Technology ATPIAL high power LA-5/PEQ or equal; (During option period Oct. 1, 2009 â€“ Sep. 30, 2010); CLIN 0004) Option - Minimum one (1) ea to a maximum of fifteen (15) ea Insight Technology ATPIAL high power LA-5/PEQ or equal; (During option period Oct. 1, 2010 â€“ Sep. 30, 2011); CLIN 0005) Option - Minimum one (1) ea to a maximum of fifteen (15) ea Insight Technology ATPIAL high power LA-5/PEQ or equal; (During option period Oct. 1, 2011 â€“ Sep. 30, 2012). These CLINs are Brand Name or Equal CLINs and all products must be from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Insight Technology Inc., or otherwise must be manufactured exactly to or exceed the OEM specifications in terms of fit, finish, size, shape, color, performance, and durability.  The desired delivery date is 30 days after delivery of contract.  The FOB point and inspection and acceptance location are destination.  Offerors are advised that award for this solicitation shall be made in the aggregate (all or none). Technical literature, warranty details, and delivery schedule must be submitted for all products offered for the Government to perform a technical evaluation. No further request will be made to obtain required information and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration. Award will be made relative to best overall value.  Best value will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all minimum specifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision. Solicitation responses must contain offerorâ€™s prompt payment discount terms (if any), proposed delivery schedule, and warranty terms. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluationâ€”Commercial Items; (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) delivery schedule; (iii) price; (iv) warranty; and (v) past performance. All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for quantity one (1) Portable Arm Coordinate	Measuring Machine. The salient characteristics are as follows: Minimum Government Specifications  This requirement is for a portable arm coordinate measuring machine (PA-CMM) with seven degrees of freedom equipped with contact and non-contact measuring probes and covering a spherical measuring volume of eight feet diameter.   The PA-CMM will be used primarily for a general purpose metrology tool to replace surface plate gages, slide calipers, and depth micrometers for assembly and disassembly dimensional measurements of precision bearing and seal test rigs.  The instrument shall provide discrete X, Y, and Z measured coordinates and provide for calculated linear dimensions and size of geometric features.  Since much of the hardware to be measured will have been cleaned for use in liquid oxygen, the PA-CMM must be a “clean” instrument and suitable for use in a 100k class clean room.  The seven degrees of freedom will allow for maximum flexibility in positioning the measuring probe for length measurement in three dimensional space.  Contact and non-contact measuring probes will allow for length measurement of conventional rigid machined surfaces and delicate surfaces.  The contact probes will allow for rigid contact and “touch-trigger” soft contact gaging.  The non-contact probe will use reflected light or a laser and allow for a continuous scan to record the three dimensional profile of a surface. The measured data shall be human readable in real time with the provision for storage and analysis after measurement by means of a PC type laptop computer with instrument specific software running under Windows Operating System.  Operating and analysis software will allow for comparison of measured features to computer aided design (CAD) data and also for reverse engineering by producing CAD data from a measured surface. Minimum Specifications: Measuring Volume:  8 foot spherical diameter. Freedom of movement: The PA-CMM shall have a seven axis degree of freedom with 360 degree rotation around the primary axes.  Gage Probe: The PA-CMM shall be able to measure a variety of samples of varying rigidity and as such should be able to make hard contact, soft contact (touch probe), and non contact measurements.   Gage Probe Extensions: The PA-CMM shall include an accessory kit of various probe geometries and extensions up to 10 inches to allow measurement in a 0.75 inch bore.	  Portability: The PA-CMM shall be portable and provided with protective transportation cases such that one person could unpack, assemble, verify calibration, and make measurements in less than 30 minutes.   Cleanliness: The PA-CMM will often be used in a 100k class clean room for assembly of turbomachinery hardware that has been cleaned for liquid oxygen service.  As such, any part of the instrument that may come in contact with the part to be measured, must withstand cleaning with solvent based fluids such as isopropyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, hydrofluoroethers, and perfluorinated cleaning solvents.  Also, as many of the intended parts to be measured will be used for liquid oxygen service and will not be able to be cleaned after measuring, no aerosol films or surface adhering reflective agents that are not compatible with oxygen service shall be used to improve the quality of a three dimensional surface scan. Sealed joints: The PA-CMM shall have sealed joints such that no lubricants or internal fluids could leak and contaminate parts to be measured for oxygen service. Accuracy: Contact Probe: Total measuring error shall not exceed 0.0016 inches at maximum extension. Non Contact, scanning probe:  Total system measuring error not to exceed 0.0035 inches at maximum extension.  Calibration: A physical standard shall be supplied to verify system measuring accuracy and to allow for “sanity checks” and calibration of custom configured probe tips.  The standard shall be NIST traceable. Temperature:  The instrument will be used in a variety of production floor environments and shall be dimensionally stable within its stated accuracy in an operating range of 50 F to 100 F with a temperature drift of up to 5 degrees F per hour either through inherent material selection or active temperature compensation. Analysis Software: Must be able to import/export to common CAD system file formats such as SolidWorks, AutoCAD or standards such as IGES.  Must be able to display current X,Y, and Z coordinate position of probe contact and display calculated geometric dimensions of multiple measurements a from graphical user interface.  Must be able to display the three dimensional representation of the surface from discrete contact measurements and a surface cloud of the measured surface from the non contact, surface scanning mode.  Must be able to display in and out of tolerance areas of measured data with respect to design or CAD data. Instrument Mounting: The mounting accessories shall include a vacuum base, a magnetic base, and one that can be clamped or bolted by the user to a fixed structure.	These can be individual bases or a combined function base. The instrument shall also provide a suitably rigid, folding tripod for a portable mount for the above bases. Data Point Measurement: Contact:  For the contact mode the instrument shall record data points in at least two modes:	a single point trigger mode and scanning mode where multiple points are continuously taken while a trigger is depressed.   Non Contact:  The instrument shall continuously record data points and display them real time on a display monitor in a surface cloud format.  The scanning mode shall knit together successive overlapping scans to indicate when full coverage of the measured part is obtained.    Non contact standoff:  Minimum 3 inch standoff, or working distance from the surface being measured.   Non-contact scan width:  Minimum of 0.75 inch per pass. Counterbalancing: The measuring arm and all attached accessories shall be balanced to require less than a 5 pound lifting force at the probe handle when fully extended. Overload protection (torque and bending moment): The instrument shall be able to compensate for arm deflections due to torque and bending moments under the instrument’s own weight over the entire range of motion and provide a warning when excessive torque and bending is being applied. On Site Training: Minimum of two days for three people; to include instrument assembly/disassembly, sample measurements, and analysis software operation. Electrical power: 120 VAC/60 Hz with cordless, rechargeable battery operation capability with minimum three hour run time.

DESCRIPTION: FCI Sandstone, Sandstone MN, operates a rear gate sallyport system consisting of two sliding gates with J operators and interlocks.  Each gate has a vehicular and man gate component.  The gates are installed in a manner that prohibits a component of one gate from being opened unless both components of the other gate is closed.  Gates are controlled by the Control Center.  The control panel at the Control Center is connected by approximately 1500 feet of wiring bundle to the gate systems, which includes a relay cabinet located in the sallyport.  The operating mechanisms of the inner sallyport gate are inoperative.  The clutch, track wear plate, pulley, drive motor, and sensor switches of the vehicular component of the inner gate system have failed.  

SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work is to replace the J operator and gate, including new overhead track and all associated clutch, track wear plate, pulley, chain, and motor mechanisms, for the inner gate.  The existing gate panel, track, and gate posts may be re-used.  Existing power circuits in the sallyport area will need to be extended to the new operator and Control Center as needed.  New relays will be installed as necessary at either the sallyport relay cabinet and/or control center panel.  Motor mechanisms will include overload protection and provision for manual operation of the gate system.  Gearbox systems will include heaters to ensure continuing lubrication capability of lubricants contained within.  Motor gearbox will be locked with a prison lock.  Detention quality hardware and tamperproof screws will be used in securing access panels, covers, hatches, and other points of entrance to the overall system.  The existing gate panel is approximately 14ft. x 14ft.  Photographs are enclosed (in hard copy bid packet) showing the gate and slider, operator and track detail, and man gate/sliding gate in it?s entirety.

In the past five years NIST has contracted for services to help deter the Canadian Geese from the 570-acre property located at 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, Md. This action to the date has drastically reduced the Geese population as with all other measures we have taken such as habitat modification & egg addling; however, if these control measures are not kept in place the Geese population will again result in littered walkways, a perceived or actual physical threat to employees, and destruction to property?s ecosystem.

The project will meet women at the crossroads of their work lives with mentoring, support resources, and learning opportunities that enable them to achieve their employment goals and then note the success of these services.  The Project will utilize technology and online learning models as well as interpersonal meetings to provide motivation, guidance, and support for the desired outcomes of finding employment, increasing wages, receiving a promotion, entering a degree or certificate program, or starting a business and report the outcomes to the Women?s Bureau.

(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>Amended:  THIS IS SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES




This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available Bm the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M. Harlan, M.D., Captain, U.S. Public Health Service, Building 10, CRC Room 5-5940, Bethesda, MD  20892.

Period and Place of Performance

The work for this project will be performed both onsite at NIDDK and offsite at the contractor?s office.  The period of performance will be Base Year plus Four (4) Option Years.  The first year is the base contract which will include the product development/testing and production/maintenance periods.

Evaluation Factors for Award

General
Award of an order will be made to the vendor whose quotation is determined by the Government to represent the best overall value.  





Technical Evaluation 
The technical portion of your quotation is significantly more important than cost or price and will be receive paramount consideration for award.  The technical portion of your quotation will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria outlined below under ?Technical Evaluation Criteria?.  

The Government will evaluate the quality of the vendor?s past performance based on the information obtained from references provided by the vendor, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the vendor concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.

Technical Evaluation Criteria for Proposal

Please refer to the table at the end of this section for the scoring scheme that will be used to evaluate all proposals.  

A.	Security (17 points)

Provide a secure environment for patients to enter/download data and for patient-clinician communication.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the vendors experience in constructing secure websites for handling confidential data. 

B.	Blood Glucose Meter Data Download (17 points)

The vendor will be judged on experience with downloading data from multiple BG meters.  

C.	Website Design (17 points)

Provide clear and usable graphical interfaces for data entry by patients. Data includes numeric measurements and textual communication.  Proposals will be evaluated on general web programming experience and clarity in previous projects. Preference will be given to proposals demonstrating experience in diabetes-related clinical trial data.

D.	Data Extraction (17 points)

The vendor must demonstrate appropriate programming capability to enable the download of accumulated data to clinicians (fellows, nurse practitioners, and their supervisors) and investigators in appropriate formats.

Proposal should highlight adequate programming ability to attain cross-browser compatibility in the system.
 
K.	Formal User Feedback Procedures (2 points)

The proposal must demonstrate a formal plan and/or experience in obtaining, tracking and incorporating suggestions for system improvements.  These suggestions will originate from the NIDDK staff (as opposed to patients).


Past Performance

The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror?s past performance based on information obtained from the references provided by the offeror, as well as other sources known to the Government.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on all standards of acceptable performance.  
The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.

Past performance will not be scored, but the Government?s conclusions about overall quality of the offeror?s past performance will be influential in determining the merits of the offeror?s proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government.

By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror?s adherence to contract behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offer?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer, the offeror?s performance in clinically-related areas,

The Government will consider the number of severity of an offer?s problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror?s overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.

The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror.

<DESC>AMENDED:  This is SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE PAGE LIMIT WAS CHANGED TO 15 PAGES.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded froG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M.

Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity

subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to
any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former
shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by
contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a
principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,
except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common
control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall
be treated as a partnership.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify questions/answers and requirements for submission of offers. i.	QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS a.	What lighting conditions should we assume to be able to configure the appropriate solution?  DAY b.	The aerial photographs do not provide sufficient detail for our engineers to plan and design an access control system or interior closed circuit television system.  We ask that you provide us civil engineering floor plans.  Considering the sensitive nat ure of such plans post 9/11, I ask that you allow us to send one of our local engineers to your office to pick up the floor plans or that you post them on Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS).  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE FLOOR PLANS FOR THIS PROJECT. WE ARE WORKING WITH DPW TO SEE IF THEY CAN PROVIDE.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE.   ii.	Submission of quotes shall be forwarded by Wednesday, September 12, 2007, 1:00 local time using either facsimile at (910) 396-7872, or email at stephanie.murphree@conus.army.mil.
