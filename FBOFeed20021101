<DESC>The goal of the Georgia Enterprise Growth Initiative (GEGI) is to create a free market business environment, further develop the financial sector infrastructure and to facilitate the rate of enterprise growth in Georgia.  

The activity outlined is planned to be implemented over five years, with an IQC buy-in mechanism to address the needs of Georgian enterprises to grow. USAID estimates the total cost of GEGI not to exceed $45 million, including up to $25 million for the main activity and up to $20 million for the IQC buy-in mechanism. The activity will have a two-year base period and three one-year options for extension.  The activity is so structured so as to allow the Mission to revalidate the applicability of the design in light of a new strategy to be completed in 2003, and to make annual determinations as to whether the activity remains a funding priority after the expiration of the base period. The three components of this activity will address the enabling environment for enterprise growth through improved policy reform, increased access to finance and increased market-oriented production.  These three components reflect the three Intermediate Results of USAID/Caucasus Strategic Objective 1.3 Accelerated Development and Growth of Private Enterprises.  A key thrust of this activity is to support the development and growth of private sector mechanisms and institutions to achieve enterprise growth.

USAID/Caucasus encourages the contractor to take an innovative approach to the implementation of program activities, bringing to bear international best practices and new ways of doing development business.  Also, consistent with USAID/Washingtons recently announced Global Development Alliance (GDA), the contractor should seek appropriate opportunities to use GEGI as a catalyst to mobilize the resources of private corporations, foundations, universities, and other non-government organizations interested in working in Georgia. For more information on the GDA, see    http://www.usaid.gov/press/releases/2001/fs010515.html. This could be accomplished through strategic alliances, and leveraging additional resources consistent within USAID policies and regulations.

GEGI will be managed and implemented in a politically unstable region.  Georgia is important to U.S. foreign policy interests and objectives in Eurasia.  Accordingly, the contractor must be cognizant of the imperative for GEGI to be a highly successful and responsive economic growth program. 

As a five-year program, GEGI will include the following three components: 1) Demand Driven Policy Reform; 2) Increased Access to Finance through Institutional Strengthening; 3) Georgia Competitiveness Initiative.

The contractor shall provide technical assistance, training, management information systems, grant management, public awareness and donor coordination services, in such a professional, timely and culturally appropriate manner as to achieve the agreed upon results defined below.  The agreed results shall be achieved in the areas of: 1) Improved implementation of policy reforms through a strengthened demand side private sector capacity to drive economic policy coupled with improved Government of Georgia implementation of policy reforms by strengthening the GOGs market-orientation (approximately 70% of Activity Budget); 2) Increased access to finance through institutional strengthening (approximately 10% of Activity Budget); and 3) Increased market-oriented production through improved competitiveness, international best practices, and quality standards (approximately 20% of Activity Budget).

Paper copies of this solicitation will not be available.  Description of Work:  This solicitation is for the design, permitting, site preparation and construction of an Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing barra cks with support spaces for 492 soldiers, one Company Operations Facility, and one Battalion Headquarters with Classrooms building. This project includes all structural, electrical, mechanical, fire protection, and information systems, intrusion detection system and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) measures. AT/FP measures include exterior security lighting, bollards, laminated glass windows, and standard setback distances from parking areas, roads, and facilities. Provisions for the handicapped will  be incorporated into the design of this project. Comprehensive interior furnishings and equipment design services are requested for the barracks, administration and operations areas. Supporting facilities include water, electrical, street lighting, inform ation systems, fire protection and alarm systems, water, sanitary and storm sewer systems, access roads, parking, sidewalks, curbs & gutters, paving, fencing, signage, outdoor recreational facilities, landscaping, site improvements, and AT/FP measures. Dem olition of existing roads in the site footprint will be accomplished as part of this project.  This project shall be designed by registered architects and engineers employed by or subcontracted by the successful contractor.  This project will be procured u sing the two-phase design-build selection procedures set forth in FAR 36.3.  In Phase I, offerors will receive a request for proposal letter including the project description, submittal requirements, and evaluation factors for both phases.  The evaluation factors for phase one will be past performance, technical approach, relevant experience and sustainable design specialized experience.  Phase II evaluation factors (in descending order of importance) will be:  Building Function & Aesthetics, Phase I evalua tion, Sustainable Design, Building Systems, Site Design, and Management Plans and Schedules.  No more than five offerors will be invited to participate in Phase II.  The Government anticipates that the Phase II documents will be issued on or about 01 Feb 0 3. Award will be made to that offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the Government. This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of technical and management features with diffe rences in cost to the Government. In making this comparison, the Government is concerned with striking the most advantageous balance between technical features and cost to the Government. As technical scores and relative advantages and disadvantages become  less distinct, differences in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal. Conversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in scoring and relative advantages and disadvantages bet ween proposals are of increased importance to the determination. The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The right is also reserved to reject any and all offers. The basis of award will be a conforming offer; the pri ce or cost of which may or may not be the lowest. Offerors are reminded to include their best technical and price terms in their initial proposal and not to automatically assume that they will have an opportunity to participate in discussions or be asked t o submit a revised offer. The Government may make award of a conforming proposal without discussions, if deemed to be within the best interests of the Governmen t. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow a complete evaluation.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the offeror.   There are no options under consideration at this time, however the need for options will be re-evaluated upon completion of the Phase Two RFP solicitation preparation and prior to the Phase Two Requests for Technical and Price Proposals being issued.  Th e estimated cost of the project is between $25,000,000.00 to $100,000,000.00.  Network Analysis will be required.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis pursuant to the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory is publishing this Synopsis/Solicitation in accordance with FAR 5.203, FAR 12.603,  FAR 13.105.   This Synopsis/Solicitation is a non-competitive solicitation, in accordance with FAR 6.302 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(l),  to Fuel Cell Technology (FTC)of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The National Energy Technology Laboratory intends to purchase a complete 5k fuel cell power unit (FCT 5kW SOFC System) that can provide electricity without normal manual oversight for instrumentation and communications gear positioned at abandoned hardrock mines for the purpose of environmental monitoring. A cost share contribution from the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) in exchange for data on the unit?s performance will substantially lower the cost to the Department of Energy of the above-referenced fuel cell purchase. The combination of FTC?s proven interest in the National Energy Technology Laboratory?s fuel cell program, the commercially available fuel cell unit, FCT 5kW SOFC System, meets the Department of Energy's performance requirements, and the existing cost share arrangement with EPRI make Fuel Cell Technology (FTC) of Kingston, Ontario, Canada, a uniquely qualified sole source for providing a workable fuel cell model with a minimum cost to the government. The U. S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory does not expect to incur additional purchases of this nature in the future.  This is a one-time purchase with no follow-on anticipated.

Date for receipt of proposals:  Wednesday, February 5, 2003

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals to develop and deliver a training course entitled ?Context Sensitive Design.?

Since World War II, the greatest transportation infrastructure in the world was built.  Although community and environmental values were part of the mission, they were often lost in the implementation. Given the policy support from ISTEA and TEA-21, NEPA and related State initiatives, local officials, neighborhood residents, multi-modal interests and non-profit organizations have increasingly called for: more sensitive design of transportation projects, particularly highways;  incorporation of alternative modes within highway and transit rights-of-way; more awareness of the land use and community impacts of transportation projects; and more awareness of the community development opportunities presented by transportation projects.

Context Sensitive Design incorporates a broad vision for transportation projects ? one that seeks to address core environmental, historic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic and socioeconomic concerns through a collaborative, open and interdisciplinary planning process. This approach entails asking questions first about the need and purpose of a project, and then equally addressing -- with the affected community -- safety, mobility, and local values.

Transportation planners and engineers need a better appreciation of these concerns as they plan, design and implement projects. At the same time, local officials, community groups, advocacy organizations and land use planners need a better understanding of the transportation project design and implementation process, liability issues and budgeting. Hopefully, a dialogue can be initiated, starting with the course curriculum, that can achieve mutual understanding of goals, constraints and shared opportunities, as well as changes in business as usual practices.

The course will be offered to Highway engineers and designers, transportation planners, engineers and outreach specialists in DOT, county, and local work force and private companies; environmental specialists, historical preservationists, land use planners (at the regional MPO, county and local levels), urban designers and landscape architects, local government officials, modal advocates, representatives of neighborhood/civic/business groups, transit agencies.

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted. Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFPs will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by December 10, 2002.  RFPs will be mailed out shortly thereafter. Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small businesses, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned business.  These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a modification to contract N00019-01-C-0066 for E-6 Contractor Logistics Support to increase cost-reimbursable contract line item values over a three year period for a total contract price change of $48,541,000 for procurement of additional initial spares and spare parts, repair parts, modification and restoration of spares and repair of parts to ready-for-issue condition.  NAVAIR intends to award this modification to the incumbent contractor, The Boeing Company, Space & Communications Group, Government Information & Communication Systems, 18-28 Bldg. 2403 68th Avenue South, Kent, WA  98032, on the basis of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies and services required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This sole source procurement is based on the fact that Boeing is unwilling to sell data rights associated with a proprietary E-6 platform-unique sparing model developed at their own expense.  Additionally, this proprietary software is the only NAVAIR approved E-6 platform sparing model.  Further, this model integrates with a database manager, containing the entire E-6 operational and wartime reserve kit spares inventory, capable of providing critical and detailed logistics information including mean time to repair, (MTTR), mean time between failure (MTBF), average repair time and average repair cost on an item-by-item basis for a rolling 18 to 24 month period.   The model also recognizes configuration similarities and differences between and among the several variants of the E-6A/B platform, including those currently in the MDS/ADWS modification cycle.  The Government will not pay for the development, test and validation of a new sparing model and database manager for this requirement.  Therefore, Boeing is the only firm with knowledge, experience and technical capability necessary to provide the required supplies and services in a timely manner for the purposes of meeting the fleets operational needs.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and there is no formal solicitation available for release.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested subcontracting opportunities in connection with this acquisition make contact with the incumbent contractor.

<DESC>The Naval Air Orlando Training Systems Division (NAVAIR Orlando TSD) contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research and development (R&D) in the areas of training and simulation technology. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is intended to cover, in general, all R&D areas of interest to the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) and its customers in the areas of (1) Human Performance Representation, (2) Knowledge Integration, (3) Command, Control, Computer, Communication, Information (C4I) to Simulation, (4) Verification, Validation, & Accreditation (VV&A), (5) Natural Environment Representation, (6) Composable Mission Space Environments, and (7) Collaborative Environments for Engineering and Simulation Education.  Specific scientific points of contact for each research area are identified on Page 1 of the BAA, as well as a detailed process that allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to the DMSO Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Program, and projected funding.  This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported and consists of a technical dialog (telephone call to scientific point of contact and informal white paper submission), followed by formal proposal submission and contract award.  Those interested in performing research in the covered areas should download the BAA and initiate a technical dialog with the appropriate scientific point of contact.  Only questions regarding the BAA process itself should be addressed to the point of contact listed below.

Contact Point: Lt Tom Wegner, 781 377-5808.  Contracting Officer: Ms Alicia Gettman, 781 377-8673.  This is not a solicitation, nor is it market research.  This is a request for comments on the Air Forces Draft Smart Gate Performance Specification.  In the wake of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Force Protection Program Office has been working a spiral development project to address several user concerns resulting from the increased security measures at base entry control points.  The system that we have come up with ensures only authorized personnel are permitted onto military installations.  It will do this by leveraging technology to increase security and throughput and ameliorate the need to have additional manpower at the gates.  The program office has attempted to capture the major user requirements into a performance specification document and would now like comments from industry.  You are encouraged to read the specification and reply with any comments that you believe would enhance the specification as we currently have it.  Concurrently, this specification is going through user review.  It is envisioned that this specification will be used as the requirements document for future base entry control projects.  One goal of this request for comments is to ensure our requirements have not accidentally eliminated a suitable solution that is currently available.  Please note that the [HANSCOM] Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) will be the primary source of information for this effort.  Interested parties should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service for the "Force Protection-Smart Gate.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from interested firms during this phase.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government official.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The ESC Ombudsman is Colonel Jerry T. Corley, Director, Commander's Staff.  The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have been brought previously to the attention of the Program Manager and/or Contracting Officer and could not be resolved satisfactorily at that level.  You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106.  Interested parties should respond to this request, in writing, within 15 days of this publication to ESC/FDK, 5 Eglin Street, Building 1624 1st Floor, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2100, Attn: Ms Alicia Gettman.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  JIANGSU ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROJECT.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for assisting Jiangsu Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in reviewing and evaluating the province?s existing air and water quality monitoring capabilities and framework, as well as evaluating equipment and technologies for upgrading the system.

The environmental quality monitoring in Jiangsu Province is currently being done by on-site manual sampling and conventional lab analysis.  This process is done only once per month and is generally considered insufficient and inefficient.  The information that is generated, is not enough to meet the standards established by the State Council to monitor industrial discharge and environmental quality.  The environmental quality is further degraded by the relatively large population and scare land area of the Province.  

To help remedy these pollution problems, Jiangsu Province is in the process of enhancing its automatic environmental quality monitoring and control system.  It is planned that from 2000 -2005, 70 automatic air quality monitoring substations and 2 mobile air quality monitoring stations will be set up in the Province.  These stations will provide real-time data acquisition, distant monitoring, and real-time transmission.  During the same time frame (2000 - 2005), 50 automatic water quality monitoring stations and 3 mobile water quality monitoring stations will be established.  

In addition to the water and air monitoring stations, an environmental information processing system will be developed and implemented.  The system includes an environmental information control center and an environmental monitoring data transmission mechanism.  The control center takes the peer-peer communication means, collects data in a set time frame and implements distant monitoring.

The Jiangsu EPD seeks to hire a Contractor to develop a feasibility study to assist in reviewing and evaluating the province's existing air and water quality monitoring capabilities and framework, as well as evaluating equipment and technologies for upgrading the system. The proposed feasibility study will include an evaluation of the existing air and water quality monitoring capabilities and framework; assistance in monitoring locations and determining parameters for air monitoring; assistance in evaluating monitoring locations and determining parameters for water monitoring; a recommendation of air quality monitoring equipment; a recommendation of water quality monitoring equipment; an evaluation of automatic monitoring data collection, processing, distant transmission, and real-time data acquisition systems; an economic and financial analysis of the project; an analysis of the probable environmental impact of the project; and an assessment of the equipment needed to carry out the project.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $270,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local time, December 18, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 3-AXIS, 3-CHANNEL LOAD CELLS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions. Q1. How many electrical outputs are needed at the connector? i.e. three outputs only for Fx, Fy & Fz? or six outputs for Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My & Mz? A1. Only three channels of data (electrical outputs) for Fx, Fy, and Fz. Q2. What type of connector(s) are needed? MS type, D Subminiature, Lemo type? Can there be more than one connector? A2. If you have a connector on sensor side, it must be positively locking and metallic.  If there is no connector on the sensor side, it must provide a 10 ft long, Teflon insulated, strain relieved cable.  There in no requirement to have a connector on the free end of the cable.  Q3. The 4 holes that have 0.256 dia thru hole, do they have to be accessible from the inside? A3. Not sure if I am interpreting the question correctly, if the question is can you have a blind hole verses a through hole that is that has access to put a wrench on top to secure a fastener, the yes.  If the blind hole has an A286 1/4"-28, insert with 1/2" thread engagement. Q4. Is testing required for each of the axis including the Force & Moment axis? in both directions for each of the axis? A4. Yes, testing and calibration are required for each axis, for each load cell per gov standard as stated in spec. Q5. Since higher sensitivity for Fx, Fy, and Fz is desirable, can we offer amplified (external or internal) output such as +/- 5VDC at the rated capacities? A5. No, our system already provides external amplification. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 11/5/02.

<DESC>This announcement provides clarification for the MRUUV Presolicitation Notice released on October 15, 2002.  NAVSEA intends to use full and open competition to award a single MRUUV Development Contract.  Execution of this contract will consist of two phases.  The first phase will design, fabricate and test a single Advanced Development UUV (ADUUV) to support risk reduction of the 21 Mission Reconfigurable UUV (21 MRUUV) System.  After completion of testing, the ADUUV will transition to the Fleet in support of emergent operations, Fleet tactics development, and future payload demonstration.  The second contract phase will be a priced option, which NAVSEA will exercise after successful completion of an ADUUV design review and completion of a total contract Integrated Baseline Review (IBR).  NAVSEA anticipates exercising this option approximately six months after contract award. The second phase will design, fabricate and test the final 21 MRUUV System.  Successful completion of this phase will deliver an MRUUV System ready for Fleet operations. The point of contact is James E.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program (IHPRPT)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-03-01-PKT
<RESPDATE>120202
<CONTACT>Donna Thomason, Contract Negotiator, Phone DSN 527-8596, Fax 661-275-9652, Email donna.thomason@edwards.af.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.   The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry in the form of Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs) regarding how future goals for the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program may be met.  This RFI is for an addendum or an update to a contractor's existing ARPP.  The purpose of the addendum is to incorporate the efforts in support of new or existing technology.  These efforts are to be addressed under the Boost and Orbit Transfer Propulsion (including propulsion efforts of The Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) IPT), Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion mission application areas.  The baseline data and goal summary information is included in the IHPRPT RFI Supplemental package for the mission application areas relative to the IHPRPT efforts.  A contractor who currently does not have an ARPP, but wishes to respond to the RFI must as a minimum, generate an ARPP that will satisfy all IHPRPT goals applicable to at least one propulsion system type within an application area. 

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information requested under this synopsis.  This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid, but a request for information only.  Those who have not previously been associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following: The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Material Command FAR Supplement, Subpart 5327.90, Foreign Disclosure.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to the IHPRPT RFI Supplemental package containing restricted information such as current component objectives and baselines.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the IHPRPT RFI Supplemental Package please contact Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS, 661-275-5713.  Submitters are advised that representatives from DoD and NASA, as well as employees of Aerospace Corporation; SPARTA Inc.; Spiral Inc.; Sverdrup, Inc.; Nyma Inc.; Centech Group Inc.; and ERC Inc., may assist the Government as advisors in reviewing the ARPPs.  Any objection to the disclosure of information to these non-Government advisors should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of documents and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  The Government will provide written comments to each Contractor specifically in the following areas: completeness, strengths, weaknesses, cost and probability of successful completion (program management and technical approach).  The comments will be based on the following: Does the ARPP address all the IHPRPT goals within all the phases of the selected mission application area(s)?  What are the strengths and weaknesses?  Is this a viable plan and do the projects integrate together toward a demonstration of simultaneous goal achievement?  Does the ARPP contain all the information requested in the RFI?  Is the ARPP clear, concise and well organized?  Reviews of the ARPPs will be scheduled to occur at each respective responder?s facility.

The IHPRPT program is a DoD/NASA/industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over the 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  The program is structured in three phases, with nominal completion dates by calendar years 2000, 2005, and 2010 with Strategic Sustainment technology demonstration milestones in 2003 (2004 for the Strategic Sustainment Missile Propulsion demonstrator).  

The information provided through the ARPPs will be used to review and revise the Government Rocket Propulsion Plan (GRPP) and to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  A Steering Committee comprised of DoD and the NASA representatives will review ARPPs submitted by the United States (U.S.) Rocket Propulsion Industry on these mission application areas.  U.S. Rocket Propulsion Industry companies who participate in this program must develop or update ARPPs mapping out their recent past, on-going and future rocket propulsion research and development (R&D) efforts, consistent with the IHPRPT program goals.  

The ARPP shall describe in detail the contractor's plan for full achievement of all the time-phased goals for each proposed propulsion system type within an application area(s); Boost and Orbit Transfer, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  Areas of particular interest include a combined Phase III Solid Boost/TSSS follow-on Missile Propulsion, Phases II and III LOx/H2 (Boost and Upperstage), Phase II and III LOx/Hc with applicability to SOV (Space Operations Vehicle) type vehicles and SMV (Space Maneuvering Vehicle).  In the tactical propulsion area, discussion for any goals the contractor believes should be added, is requested as well.  The contractor may propose work in one or all application areas, but must address all goals (referenced in the supplemental package) and phases within any proposed application area for each type of propulsion system.  It should be noted that all efforts which address strategic sustainment technology must be separately identifiable from all other efforts for the purposes of technical and financial management.  New, innovative concepts and processes are encouraged.  It is the intent of the Government to issue a call for ARPPs on a biannual basis.


EIGHT copies of each response must be submitted to Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS, 5 Pollux Drive, Edwards AFB CA  93524-7048.  Mr. DeGeorge will also be your point of contract for technical questions.  Electronic responses are acceptable.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  Responses shall be due no later than 02 Dec 2002.  Items to be delivered to the Government, in response to the RFI, are technical documents.  Contractor presentations of the ARPPs will be requested and scheduled after the receipt of responses.  Late responses will not be reviewed.  The items submitted shall be "For Official Use Only", unclassified.
 
The point of contact for this RFI is Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS (661-275-5713).

<DESC>This is a request for information only.  There is no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking sources that may be capable of providing Performance Based Logistics (PBL) support service for the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Electro Optical Subsystem (EOSS).  The EOSS PBL support would be for approximately 52 production units over an anticipated period of performance of 1 Oct 03 through 30 Sept 08.  The support would consist of providing a 24-hour response of ready for issue (RFI) EOSS assets from a contractor's facility on a broad arrow requisition delivered from a Navy Inventory Control Point.  For non-broad arrow requisitions, a maximum of 30-day response to a requisition for a ready for issue asset is acceptable.  The contractor is responsible for repairing, calibrating, inventorying, tracking and reporting non-RFI assets and managing inventory to assure the 24 hour or 30 day response times can always be met.  The contractor is responsible to purchase additional quantities of inventory should they prove necessary to meet the above response times.  Additionally, the contractor will act as a mini-Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC), will interface with a Navy database and will be responsible for managing the obsolescence and reliability requirements for the EOSS.  The Navy has a Technical Data Package (TDP) detailing the current configuration of the EOSS.  The TDP is currently under evaluation to determine its accuracy and completeness. Also, the Navy has an existing stock of repairable assembly spares and production/testing equipment that could transition to the prospective contractor but may not be sufficient to meet the 24 hour/30 day response time requirement or support the entire effort.  These include, but are not limited to, circuit card assemblies, Video Processor Assemblies (VPA), Integrated Photonics Assemblies (IPA), Collimator Housing Assemblies (CHA), Laser Attenuation Modules (LAM), Line Source Target assemblies, radiometers, beam-splitters, probes, scopes, theodolites, mounting arms, holding fixtures and optical tables.
Additionally, approximately 18-24 months into this effort, the existing configuration of the EOSS will be upgraded to meet a new F-18 AT-FLIR requirement.   The contractor will need to be capable, during this transition phase, of supporting the current configuration and working with the manufacturer of the EOSS upgrade, Northrop Grumman Corp., to plan and effectively transition the PBL support from the existing configuration to the upgraded configuration.  It is anticipated that the new configuration will have an upgraded LAM, CHA, IPA, and VPA.  A written response detailing corporate capability to support the requirements above is required.  Specific information concerning past experience performing PBL requirements for sophisticated EO equipment is desired.   The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  Responses should cite RFI number N68335-03-RFI- 0003 and be addressed to the attention of Ms. Dawn Chartier, Code 25222.  All responses are due 20 November 2002.

<DESC>The National Telecommunications & Information (NTIA)has a requirement for the development of multiple software measurement modules and script language capabilities for 4th generation radio spectrum measurement system per the attached Statement of Work:  
Software Development for the RSMS-4th Generation System
The RSMS is currently in its third generation of design and operation by NTIA's Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) in Boulder, CO.  Although the RSMS-3rd generation system is a powerful measurement tool, its status as a state-of-the-art spectrum measurement system is threatened by rapid advances in radio technology. Therefore, a fourth-generation upgrade has been proposed and approved: RSMS-4. New broadband measurement and calibration capabilities are needed to assess the effects of emerging technologies such as time-domain-based ultrawideband (UWB) and spread-spectrum systems. Other capabilities needed include signal identification, direction-finding, operation at higher frequencies, and remote control. Challenges that await in the near future include measurements of adaptive systems that can very rapidly change their channel usage, modulation bandwidths, or antenna pattern.
Fourth generation RSMS upgrade is divided into three areas of development: Hardware, Software, and Vehicle; of those three, software development consists of designing and implementing code for equipment control, data acquisition, and data analysis.  The software is being developed for a Windows 2000 operating system using an object oriented approach to programming in Visual Basic 6.0.  Specifics of the software requirements are posted at the ITS web site: 			http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/home/programs/rsms-4/
The current need is for outside contract help to generate specific measurement code modules that will integrate with existing code and code simultaneously being developed by ITS staff.  There are two primary areas of development as described below:
TASKS:**************************
1	The Contractor Will Development (Using Object-oriented Techniques) Measurement DLLs For The RSMS-4G Software
1.1	Measurement DLLs will consist of the following:
1.1.1	further develop the current stepped measurements for pulsed and non-pulsed emitters.
1.1.2	further develop magnitude calibration procedures using the protocol currently employed by ITS.
1.2	The individual measurements (except calibration) are described in the Functional Measurement Requirements posted on the RSMS-4G web site: 
http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/home/programs/rsms-4/			
1.3	Magnitude calibrations consist of procedures for automatic diode calibrations.
1.4	Measurement class objects will communicate with other class objects developed by ITS team members in the following manner:
1.4.1	other modules will request the execution by the specified measurement module and will designate associated measurement requirements such as calibration, antenna pointing.
1.4.2	the measurement modules will in-turn issue the appropriate generic control commands via an instrument virtual panels or instrument interface class.
1.4.3	data will be packaged and sent to the appropriate file I/O module for storage.
1.5	The contractor will, in addition, give feedback to ITS staff in order to fine tune the software architectural pertinent to the measurement modules.
2	The Contractor Will Further Develop a Built-in Script Language Capability That Implements Compiled Modules Of The RSMS-4G Software For Execution Of Custom Tailored Measurement Algorithms.
2.1	The purpose is to provide the user with a user-friendly language that has direct access to internal software system components.  This will allow for development and prototyping of new software capabilities without the need for re-compiling.
2.2	The contractor will provide input to the software architectural design so that the script language capability can be fully integrated with the software package.
2.3	The contractor will develop a script language users reference manual describing the protocol for writing custom designed measurements.

<BODY>
<DIV align=center><B>Request for Information for </b><BR><B>Electronic Records 
Archives</b></div>
<P>The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to identify potential 
integration contractors, and solicit information from vendors on current or 
future commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products needed to satisfy critical 
technical needs for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) 
Electronic Records Archives (ERA) system. To support this, NARA has clarified 
key concepts and provided additional ERA background information; and updated the 
ERA acquisition approach and solicited industry comments.</p>
<P><B>BACKGROUND</p></b>
<P>The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of 
electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, 
enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the 
system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal 
Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, 
and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of 
access, now and for the life of the Republic. The solution must provide for the 
preservation, management, and access to the records of the Federal Government, 
not the preservation of technology or technological artifacts. </p>
<P>NARA intends to deploy the ERA system nationwide in the National Archives in 
the Washington area and its regional sites, the Presidential Libraries, and the 
Federal Records Centers. An enormous volume of data and number of records will 
be transferred to NARA over the next few years. The projected accumulated volume 
of electronic records received by the ERA from 2005 through 2010 is estimated to 
be 0.9 petabytes, and the accumulated volume is estimated to increase to 10.7 
petabytes by 2014. The solution must be able to ingest and manage such large 
quantities of data, and be scalable to support even greater expansion in later 
years.</p>
<P>An essential attribute of the solution is that it must recognize that the 
problem is inherently dynamic: as long as information technology continues to 
evolve, new data formats will be developed and new types of electronic records 
will be created. The system must be able to keep pace with these changes, as 
well as to take advantage of improved technology in order to improve service and 
efficiency. For example, the solution should be able to move large volumes of 
electronic records forward in time onto new hardware, storage media, operating 
system, and data management environments.</p>
<P>NARA considers reliable, long life digital media to be only a part of a 
solution to its requirements. A solution which provides positive gains such as 
reduced storage costs or improved data transfer rates through relatively 
frequent media refreshment or replacement would also be viable, provided that 
the transfer from older to newer media could be accomplished without corruption 
of the data transferred. Other key components to the solution include the 
hardware and software needed to read the media, and present it to users or other 
systems.</p>
<P>Various strategies for long-term preservation of digital data have been 
proposed and combinations of such strategies may be necessary to satisfy NARA?s 
requirements fully. One strategy that NARA has investigated is the 
transformation of electronic records written in formats subject to obsolescence 
to a "persistent archives" format. In this format the content, structure, 
appearance, and context of each record are described and stored in an easy to 
understand, non-proprietary format that is independent of the hardware, 
operating system, and software used to create the record. This representation 
will enable future technologies and people to recognize and use the records many 
years in the future on computer platforms not yet invented. However, NARA will 
not dictate how its requirements should be met. NARA intends to stipulate 
functional and other requirements and invite bidders to propose what they 
believe to be the optimal ways to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<P>Detailed background information on the ERA program is available at the ERA 
web site, http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives. </p>
<P>NARA intends to make a significant investment in development of the ERA, 
providing capabilities to capture, preserve, and provide access to electronic 
records indefinitely into the future. NARA is developing detailed requirements 
that will be used as the basis for the ERA solicitation. A set of system 
features has been identified to assist industry in better understanding the 
nature of the ERA. Descriptions of these features are distributed for 
informational purposes only and do not constitute formal system requirements. 
The ERA feature descriptions and other acquisition related information including 
the ERA Mission Needs Statement, Vision Statement, and Concept of Operations are 
located on the ERA web site at: 
http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/acquisition_information.</p>
<P>One special item of clarification concerns the application of imaging 
technology to the ERA. The ERA is being developed for records that are either 
"born digital" or have been converted to digital format by the agencies 
providing those records to NARA. While NARA will continue to receive paper 
documents for preservation from Federal agencies, there is no requirement within 
the context of the ERA to scan paper records for ingest as electronic records. 
</p>
<P><B>ACQUISITION APROACH:</p></b>
<P>The Government is requesting information to identify potential contractors 
capable of acting in the role of systems integrator to build the ERA system. The 
preliminary ERA business and contracting approach outlined below is for a 
full-and-open competition in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by 
FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. </p>
<P>To date, NARA?s acquisition approach is initially to award multiple 
development contracts using a best value competition. NARA is seeking 
integrators who can put together teams that offer best solutions from both a 
technical and cost perspective. Under the initial Requirements and Analysis 
phase of the development contract the selected contractors will each produce a 
detailed system requirements specification and high-level system design. At the 
end of this phase there will be a down-select to a single contractor that will 
develop the ERA. Contractors will be evaluated on their program management, 
integration, systems engineering, and software development process maturity. To 
be considered for selection as one of the developers, contractor and major 
subcontractor organizations actually performing the work will be expected to 
demonstrate a Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Software Capability Maturity 
Model (SW-CMM) Level 3 capability. </p>
<P>The Government intends to utilize an Independent Verification and Validation 
(IV&V) contractor to assist the Government in oversight of the Development 
Contractor?s activities and to evaluate delivered products.</p>
<P>The Requirements and Analysis Phase duration is expected to not exceed twelve 
months. Major products from this phase include a System Requirements 
Specification (SRS), System Specification, and a Requirements and Design Review. 
Following this, up to five increments are anticipated for development of the 
ERA. The development of each increment will be exercised as an option. The first 
increment will incorporate sufficient core functionality to achieve an Initial 
Operational Capability (IOC). The Government will retain unlimited rights in 
data on any systems, processes, or items developed under these contracts, 
including data developed by contractors who are subsequently down-selected after 
the Requirements and Analysis Phase. The Government?s contracting approach for 
the first three incremental options are to award Fixed Price Award Fee 
contracts. Later increments, if any, may be bound by not-to-exceed pricing. </p>
<P>NARA?s plan is to award a separate Operations contract to a single contractor 
prior to fielding of the ERA system IOC. The Operations contractor will operate 
and maintain the ERA infrastructure, including servers, archival storage, and 
communications systems. Specific facility location requirements have not been 
determined, and may include either NARA and/or contractor sites. Physically 
separate system instances will be necessary for classified data and potentially 
for redundant data. In the event that a contractor believes that outsourcing 
both the System Development and Operations contracts as a single contract is a 
viable alternative please submit a white paper (not to exceed 5 pages) with your 
response, explaining why such an approach would be advantageous to the 
government. These 5 pages will not be considered within the 20-page maximum</p>
<P><B>DESIRED TECHNOLOGY</p></b>
<P>The Government is requesting information from integrators as well as hardware 
and software vendors to ensure that all available COTS products that can provide 
capabilities critical to the success of the ERA are identified. In addition to 
currently available products, the Government wants to understand the 
capabilities of products under development that will be available by mid-Fiscal 
Year 2004 and any technology that will be reasonably mature a few years further 
in the future. The electronic records of the Federal Government are digital 
objects that satisfy criteria set out in law: they are made or received in the 
course of government business and are preserved either as evidence of government 
business or because they contain valuable information. There are no technical 
limitations on the formats or data types that comprise electronic records. 
Electronic records include, but are not limited to, the output of office 
automation products (email, word processing documents, presentations, 
spreadsheets, etc.), databases, images of documents, digital photographs, video, 
voice mail, audio, multi-media, satellite imagery, data from scientific 
instruments, digital engineering and architectural drawings, models, and so 
forth. Information is requested on:</p>
<OL>
  <LI>Strategies and approaches for preserving data for persistent storage and 
  eventual retrieval. Proposed data preservation techniques should be 
  independent of specific hardware and software architectures and products, and 
  support the natural evolution of computer technologies. Emphasis on the 
  approach's extensibility over time as well as an incremental deployment 
  approach should be addressed. 
  <LI>Mass storage solutions that support archives scalable to tens of petabytes 
  or more. Proposed solutions should provide information on the distributed 
  nature of the mass storage solution, the fault tolerance of the overall 
  solution, the ability to scale over time, and the ability to incrementally 
  deploy the solution. Vendors should provide information on the capabilities of 
  the storage management software to control and manage a large distributed 
  archive. Relationships and discriminators between file systems, database 
  systems, and data management software within the proposed architecture should 
  be highlighted. Provide information on performance, including factors 
  affecting performance characteristics. Provide information on redundant 
  storage capability, including the ability to replicate data at remote 
  locations. Indicate backup and recovery capabilities and disaster recovery 
  strategies supported by the solution. Indicate ability to interface with other 
  physical archives within a larger heterogeneous distributed architecture. 
  <LI>Capabilities for large scale, distributed, flexible, and programmable 
  workflow products applicable to ERA. Products should support a large system 
  pipelined with multi-threaded record movements that must be tracked, 
  monitored, assigned, and controlled. Vendors should comment on how their 
  proposed products/solutions can seamlessly integrate into the ERA operational 
  environment and provide for full maintenance and operations coverage, both for 
  archival science and computer operations personnel. 
  <LI>Software products capable of converting complete electronic records from 
  their native proprietary format to open standard markup languages (e.g., XML) 
  or other non-proprietary persistent formats in such a way as to preserve the 
  content and appearance of the original record. Provide a complete list of all 
  specific source formats that can be converted, including as applicable 
  hardware and operating system environments, identification of the software 
  product used to create the format, or other pertinent information. Describe in 
  detail the output format of the converted records and the capabilities of any 
  templates, schemas or Data Type Definitions (DTDs), template editors, or 
  viewers. 
  <LI>Software capable of format to format conversion of electronic records from 
  source formats of all types (including obsolete formats) to destination 
  representations that are viewable or otherwise user accessible using current 
  technology. Examples of destination formats include ASCII, RTF, HTML, XML, 
  TIFF, MPEG-4, or widely used proprietary formats. Provide a complete list of 
  all specific source formats that can be converted, including as applicable 
  hardware and operating system environments, identification of the software 
  product used to create the format, or other pertinent information. Describe 
  the output format of the converted records. 
  <LI>Software capable of creating and applying schemas, templates, or models to 
  accept, parse, validate, and reformat electronic records or descriptions of 
  record collections received by the ERA from Government agencies. An analyst 
  using this software should be able to describe the characteristics and order 
  of the input stream, including validation criteria, and to render that 
  information into a schema, template, or model. Users should be able to modify 
  or copy existing schemas, templates, or models, and apply them to electronic 
  records. The software must be able to parse the input stream, perform any 
  specified validation, and render validated records into a standardized format 
  suitable for ingestion by the ERA. Also describe tools for management of the 
  evolution of schemas over time. 
  <LI>Other software products capable of preserving, retrieving and presenting 
  authentic electronic records over unlimited cycles of changes in hardware and 
  software.</li></ol>

<SUBJECT>D--PROGRAM INFORMATION SYSTEMS MISSION SERVICES (PRISMS)
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide additional information regarding the utilization of the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes as they relate to potential subcontracting relationships for the pending PrISMS recompetition. This information is as follows: Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has received several inquiries concerning the assignment of and determination of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.  The level of questions indicates that there is confusion concerning the code's use as it relates to this method of size determination.	These codes classify businesses as small and also carries over to all the other target business classifications in the socioeconomic program.	These size standards essentially affect the ability of a small business to participate in direct and subcontract opportunities. The MSFC Small Business Office utilizes the NAICS codes.  These standards, with metrics and descriptions, may be found at  http://www.sba.gov/size/indextableofsize.html  .  Marshall prime contractors shall also utilize NAICS in determining the size of its subcontractors for services/produces under their contracts.  The NAICS codes should represent the overall or dominant segment of the requirement.   MSFC determines the code for the entire direct requirement based on the best match between the largest task areas of the statement of work.  The prime contractor must also break down the component tasks of the requirement and assign different codes based on the best match of each task group.	The prime will then assign a code to the subcontract based on the specific work under that subcontract.  If multiple work areas are combined in one subcontract, the larger work area should determine the code assignment.  For example, one requirement for information services may carry a code for Data Processing Services of 514210 with a size standard of 23 million annual sales.  The subcontracting could be for Communications Equipment Repair and Maintenance 811213 with a size standard of 5 million annual sales and one for Wired Communications Carriers 513310 with a size standard of 1500 employees.  Again, MSFC assigns the code for the whole requirement while each prime assigns the code for the subcontracting packages.   It should be noted that MSFC serves in an advisory role for the subcontract assignments. Each subcontractable area stands alone with separate NAICS code; therefore, every proposing team can have different NAICS codes for its team members depending on how each team has structured the division of the work.   In a large requirement numerous codes may be utilized.    These determinations can obviously be subjective.	MSFC makes every effort to accurately match its direct requirements with the appropriate NAICS codes while the proposing primes must make the determination of its subcontract packages.  The Small Business Administration can provide assistance in making these determinations.  Ms. Barbara Jenkins is a SBA procurement center representative located at MSFC and can be contacted at 256-544-5012. If you need additional information, please contact Stan McCall at 256-544-0254 or David Brock at 256-544-0267.

<SUBJECT>A -- National Cancer Institute is seeking CRADA partners to pursue chemical optimization of molecular-targeted anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial drug leads
<DESC>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute is seeking CRADA partners to pursue chemical optimization of molecular-targeted anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial drug leads.  The Screening Technologies Branch (STB) of DTP has completed high-throughput screening campaigns of more than 140,000 samples from the NCI repository addressing a number of molecular targets of potential therapeutic significance.  Lead compounds with potent and selective activity have been identified in a number of target areas.  Preliminary structure-activity studies have been performed with available chemical analogs.  Additional work is needed to optimize the screening leads for potency and pharmaceutical properties consistent with clinical development.  This is envisioned primarily as a two-stage process.  In the first stage, the structures of screening leads will be reviewed by an expert medicinal chemist (CRADA partner) to identify potential problems related to formulation, chemical stability, metabolism, toxicity, etc.  Based on this analysis, lead compounds may be subjected to secondary and in vivo testing directly, or a series of derivatives/analogs may designed to obviate problems.  Derivative compounds will be tested in the primary screening models to demonstrate retention of targeting activity and selected active compounds will then be tested in secondary and in vivo models.  In the second stage of optimization, in vivo active compounds will be subjected to additional analysis and additional derivatives/analogs will be synthesized to further optimize activity.  Additional iterations may be performed to define clinical development candidates.  All biological testing will be performed by DTP.  Opportunities are currently available to optimize leads for inhibition of HIF-1 (Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1) alpha signaling, for inducers of CEBP alpha signaling, and for inhibition of HIV-1 virus assembly.  Additional opportunities are anticipated during the next six months.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program (IHPRPT)
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.   The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry in the form of Advanced Rocket Propulsion Plans (ARPPs) regarding how future goals for the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program may be met.  This RFI is for an addendum or an update to a contractor's existing ARPP.  The purpose of the addendum is to incorporate the efforts in support of new or existing technology.  These efforts are to be addressed under the Boost and Orbit Transfer Propulsion (including propulsion efforts of The Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) IPT), Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion mission application areas.  The baseline data and goal summary information is included in the IHPRPT RFI Supplemental package for the mission application areas relative to the IHPRPT efforts.  A contractor who currently does not have an ARPP, but wishes to respond to the RFI must as a minimum, generate an ARPP that will satisfy all IHPRPT goals applicable to at least one propulsion system type within an application area. 

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information requested under this synopsis.  This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid, but a request for information only.  Those who have not previously been associated with the IHPRPT program should be aware of the following: The IHPRPT program will involve technology acquisitions that have military or space applications and are subject to Air Force Material Command FAR Supplement, Subpart 5327.90, Foreign Disclosure.  In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate as prime contractors.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access to the IHPRPT RFI Supplemental package containing restricted information such as current component objectives and baselines.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the IHPRPT RFI Supplemental Package please contact Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS, 661-275-5713.  Submitters are advised that representatives from DoD and NASA, as well as employees of Aerospace Corporation; SPARTA Inc.; Spiral Inc.; Sverdrup, Inc.; Nyma Inc.; Centech Group Inc.; and ERC Inc may assist the Government as advisors in reviewing the ARPPs.  Any objection to the disclosure of information to these non-Government advisors should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of documents and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  The Government will provide written comments to each Contractor specifically in the following areas: completeness, strengths, weaknesses, cost and probability of successful completion (program management and technical approach).  The comments will be based on the following: Does the ARPP address all the IHPRPT goals within all the phases of the selected mission application area(s)?  What are the strengths and weaknesses?  Is this a viable plan and do the projects integrate together toward a demonstration of simultaneous goal achievement?  Does the ARPP contain all the information requested in the RFI?  Is the ARPP clear, concise and well organized?  Reviews of the ARPPs will be scheduled to occur at each respective responder?s facility.

The IHPRPT program is a DoD/NASA/industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the year 2010 that will permit a doubling of rocket propulsion capabilities over the 1993 state-of-the-art technology.  The program is structured in three phases, with nominal completion dates by calendar years 2000, 2005, and 2010 with Strategic Sustainment technology demonstration milestones in 2003 (2004 for the Strategic Sustainment Missile Propulsion demonstrator).  

The information provided through the ARPPs will be used to review and revise the Government Rocket Propulsion Plan (GRPP) and to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.  A Steering Committee comprised of DoD and the NASA representatives will review ARPPs submitted by the United States (U.S.) Rocket Propulsion Industry on these mission application areas.  U.S. Rocket Propulsion Industry companies who participate in this program must develop or update ARPPs mapping out their recent past, on-going and future rocket propulsion research and development (R&D) efforts, consistent with the IHPRPT program goals.  

The ARPP shall describe in detail the contractor's plan for full achievement of all the time-phased goals for each proposed propulsion system type within an application area(s); Boost and Orbit Transfer, Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion.  Areas of particular interest include a combined Phase III Solid Boost/TSSS follow-on Missile Propulsion, Phases II and III LOx/H2 (Boost and Upperstage), Phase II and III LOx/Hc with applicability to SOV (Space Operations Vehicle) type vehicles and SMV (Space Maneuvering Vehicle).  In the tactical propulsion area, discussion for any goals the contractor believes should be added, is requested as well.  The contractor may propose work in one or all application areas, but must address all goals (referenced in the supplemental package) and phases within any proposed application area for each type of propulsion system.  It should be noted that all efforts which address strategic sustainment technology must be separately identifiable from all other efforts for the purposes of technical and financial management.  New, innovative concepts and processes are encouraged.  It is the intent of the Government to issue a call for ARPPs on a biannual basis.


EIGHT copies of each response must be submitted to Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/PRS, 5 Pollux Dr. 4 Draco Drive, Edwards AFB CA  93524-7048.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Period of Performance for this project is 15 weeks from the date of contract award.  The Government reserves the right to unilaterally extend the period of contract performance in accordance with the clause entitled, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract - - Services. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-20. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52-212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 4) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 5) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-03-RP-87020; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  BACKGROUND  The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 created the Risk Management Agency (RMA).  Under the act, RMA was established as an independent agency to provide supervision to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) and oversight of all crop insurance programs.  FCIC is a wholly owned Government corporation that issues insurance regulations and manages crop insurance funds.  The crop insurance program is a joint effort by the private sector (insurance companies) and RMA to provide crop insurance to qualified producers.  RMA works closely with the insurance companies to implement the crop insurance program.  However, RMA is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the program.  Federal policy states that agencies shall provide reasonable assurance that "both existing and new program and administrative activities are effectively and efficiently managed to achieve the goals of the agency."  To implement this policy, RMA has enlisted the help of the insurance companies by creating a self-audit program.  Insurance companies review the quality of their performance and evaluate their compliance and correct activities that are not in compliance. Subtitle B of "The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000" (ARPA) directs the Secretary of Agriculture to improve the compliance and integrity of the crop insurance program.   ARPA does not mandate the elements of the quality control system, but it does expand the efforts that RMA and the insurance companies currently make under that system.  The Guidelines and Expectations for Delivery of the Federal Crop Insurance Program, commonly referred to as Manual 14, establishes the reviews, which include randomly selected samples, that are key to the information RMA now receives in its efforts to ensure the integrity of the crop insurance program.  ARPA's mandate for identification of noncompliance by producers or insurance companies and of fraud, waste and abuse will call upon RMA and the insurance companies to commit greater resources than currently used to fulfill the oversight function. Stewardship responsibility over public funds requires that RMA have appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the integrity of Federal program payments and implement its existing responsibilities to minimize erroneous payments.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.  Documents that apply to this SOW are contained in the FCIC-14010, Guidelines and Expectations for Delivery of the Federal Crop Insurance program, and the Standard Reinsurance Agreement, which are available on RMA's website at http://www.rma.usda.gov.  OBJECTIVE.
