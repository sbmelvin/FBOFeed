<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-08-Q-300018 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside.  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees. This synopsis/solicitation is issued for the overhaul of AIR PRESS REGULATOR, NSN-1660-00-084-6707, Part Number 106040-4-1, quantity of 8 (Mfg cage code 59364), to be overhauled in accordance with the Air Force Technical Order 15A1-4-3-43; The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. 
Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping reparables which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair".  Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage.  Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition.  Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work".  The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices.  Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.  The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document.  Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule.  Delivery is required no later than 30 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the reparables.  Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. This material has been designated as “Flight Critical”. Contractor is to provide FAA Certifications or DOD certifications with their proposal.  The USCG, ARSC engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Government intends to issue an unrestricted solicitation (Full and Open) solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a Small Business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns. All interested business concerns shall indicate interest in this acquisition by providing the company name, mailing address, phone number, and electronic mail address to the contracting office by the due date stated in this notice.  The government is under no obligation to consider information received after the due date as part of the formal market research for this acquisition.
