<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Public Health and Science (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with ABC Radio Network, Dallas, Texas.
Purpose:
 

To provide services and voice talent to develop, promote, and broadcast public service health messages to African Americans throughout the U.S.  Messages will focus on critical health areas identified by Steps to a Healthier U.S., the HHS Disparities Initiative, and Healthy People 2010.  These include:  cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, infant mortality, child and adult immunizations, and asthma.   

Background

HHS has made eliminating health disparities affecting racial and ethnic minority 
   populations a critical goal of Healthy People 2010, the nation's public health agenda 
for the current decade.  Achievement of disparities objectives is also key to accomplishment of the President’s Healthier US agenda, the HHS Steps to a Healthier US program, and the HHS Disparities Initiative.  

To support this goal, HHS and its Office of Minority Health seek to deliver scientifically valid and culturally appropriate health messages to each racial and ethnic minority community.  OMH is seeking to deliver messages via commercial broadcast radio because national radio provides more spot availabilities for dollars spent.  ABC has a national reach of more than 31 million listeners each week.  Our nine week Take a Loved One to The Doctor Day PSAs will heard by nearly 311 million listeners across the U.S. and the cost per 1,000 listeners is under $3.00 for the total campaign.

ABC Radio Networks has demonstrated its interest in working in this area with HHS since 2001.  ABC Radio approached HHS regarding creation of a health campaign in early 2001.  Subsequently, HHS and ABC Radio launched the Closing the Health Gap campaign in December 2001 with donated broadcast time and promotional support from ABC.  HHS has not previously purchased broadcast time for this campaign with ABC Radio or any other any vendor.  

With more than 4,800 affiliate radio stations, ABC Radio reaches 158 million persons age 12 and older each week.  ABC Radio’s Urban has a major share of the African American radio market, being heard by 17 million African-Americans weekly.  Morning personality Tom Joyner is a major and trusted source of information in this market and the principal spokesperson for prior collaborations on health with HHS.  His The Tom Joyner Morning Show can be heard daily on 119 of 240 ABC Radio Urban Advantage Network affiliates and around the world on the American Forces Radio and Television Service. 

As part of the Health Gap campaign, Take A Loved One to the Doctor Day, now planned for the third Tuesday of each September, is the signature event of the Health Gap campaign. This year, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson has declared September 16th Take A Loved One to the Doctor Day.  The focus of the day is to encourage individuals to visit a health professional (a doctor, a nurse, a nurse practitioner, or another health provider), make an appointment for a visit, attend a health event in the community, or help a friend, neighbor, or family member do the same. HHS and its partners also encourage communities around the country to organize health events on this day. 

This year, HHS intends to seek broader distribution of its health messages in order to support the campaign and promote Take A Loved One to the Doctor Day events organized by community health centers and local organizing groups around the country.  It will use commercial broadcast time purchased for this purpose to promote Doctor Day and deliver 
health messages focused on prevention and early detection of disease as critical steps toward eliminating health disparities in African Americans and other minority communities.  HHS seeks to utilize ABC Radio channels to support its outreach to African American communities.
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.
