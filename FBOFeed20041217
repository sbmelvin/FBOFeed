<SUBJECT>B--Literature Review, Synthesis, and Design of Monitoring of Ambient Artificial Light Intensity on the Arctic OCS Regarding Potential Effects on Resident Marine Fauna
<SOLNBR>0105RP39072
<RESPDATE>011905
<ARCHDATE>12172005
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contracting Officer 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract for the study described below and solicits CAPABILITY STATEMENTS for the study entitled "LITERATURE REVIEW, SYNTHESIS, AND DESIGN OF MONITORING OF AMBIENT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT INTENSITY ON THE ARCTIC OCS REGARDING POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON RESIDENT MARINE FAUNA"  for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  The NAICS code is 541690. The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  BACKGROUND:  In the Final Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2002-2007, (July 2002), the MMS proposes lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea/Hope Basin, Norton Basin, and Cook Inlet Planning Areas.  Stipulation No. 8 of the MMS Final Beaufort Sea Multiple Sale EIS (February 2003) requires that all structures associated with offshore drilling must be lighted in order to avoid avian mortality.  Substantial development in the Arctic involving the deployment of artificial light sources has already occurred adjacent to and in the Beaufort Sea.  Industrial support facilities, such as the buildings and storage areas at West Dock, structures at Endicott Spur Drilling Island, structures and work areas on Northstar Island, and support vessels and supporting facilities are already brightly lighted.  More lighted structures can be expected as OCS development proceeds.  Light radiating outward from structures is a potential factor affecting the marine environment.  Little study has been made of the introduction of artificial light into the formerly dark fall and winter Arctic habitats of numerous species of marine invertebrates, fish, water birds, and mammals.  These include a number of protected species that live in, or migrate through, potentially artificially lighted habitat during dark periods and seasons.  At a recent interagency coordination meeting, the issue of potential conflict between lighting strategies and other non-avian marine life was raised.  THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IN THE DARK ARCTIC BY CONDUCTING A LITERATURE REVIEW AND DESIGNING A POTENTIAL ARTIFICIAL LIGHT MONITORING PROGRAM.  The study will lay groundwork for future monitoring of ecological effects of increased artificial lighting at several trophic levels.  Information generated from this proposed literature review and synthesis will be used by MMS in a variety of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) assessments and/or other environmental considerations.  It will support planning for and decisions about artificial light in the Arctic.  The proposed monitoring program suggested by this project will help shape future recommendations in this area.  THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN TASKS:  TASK 1 - LITERATURE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS (a) CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING EFFECTS ON ARCTIC MARINE SPECIES COMMONLY FOUND IN ALASKA OCS LEASE AREAS, including species which are important trophic components, protected species, or endangered species in the Beaufort Sea Area.  Emphasis will be devoted toward potential effects during normally dark periods or seasons in the Alaska arctic marine environment.  A review of the physics of light transmission and reflectance, methods of measurement, and applicable modeling will be included and summarized.  Potential sources of information include, but are not limited to: primary scientific literature and books from national and international sources; unpublished reports, analyses, and other accessible documents; other sources such as internet homepages and accessible data bases.  The contractor is requested to also contact appropriate sources at the Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Alaska Resources Library and Information Services, and/or other knowledgeable sources to identify local information on responses of sensitive species to light, and prepare related annotated bibliographic information.  (b) FOR THIS TASK, DRAFT AND FINAL NARRATIVE REPORTS OF THE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF INFORMATION, methods used, major information sources, contacts with information sources, and any problems encountered SHALL BE PREPARED.  The report shall summarize/list any expected, but currently unavailable pertinent reports, journal articles, or other in-press material of which the MMS Alaska OCS Region should be aware and of which the contractor has learned as part of the search.  The report shall explain any special background, features, classifications within, considerations, or limitations of the annotated bibliography prepared.  A FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT AND BIBLIOGRAPHY SHALL BE REQUIRED.  The bibliography shall be annotated and in a ProCite or ProCite-compatible format.  TASK 2 - HOLD A TECHNICAL MEETING:  Hold a one-day technical meeting at MMS Alaska office (Anchorage, Alaska) to consider information needs based on the literature search and to identify important areas where there is limited or no information, to discuss alternative approaches and sampling strategies, and to make recommendations on the potential design of an artificial ambient light monitoring program for existing Arctic OCS development areas.  The principal investigator shall make presentations, answer questions, and discuss options with representatives of the MMS, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other invited parties. For this meeting, the principal investigator shall present the results of the literature review (TASK 1) and shall present a preliminary design for an artificial ambient light-monitoring program which could be potentially applied in existing OCS development areas. The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THE RESULTANT CONTRACT WILL BE EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS WITH AN ESTIMATED COST RANGE OF $130,000 TO $150,000.   HOW TO RESPOND: To compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate they are qualified to perform the work by providing a CAPABILITY STATEMENT, describing in detail: (A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of organizational facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years.

<DESC>NASA MSFC plans to continue their Site Licenses Agreement (SLA) to allow NASA MSFC to use existing Unigraphics Solutions (UGS) software for up to five years, including any software updates developed during the term of the SLA. The proposed SLA will provide up to 45 concurrent licenses UGS CAx, Teamcenter Engineering and basic visualization software, and up to 75 licenses for Solid Edge.  It will also include up to seven licenses of all other UGS software including VisView, Teamcenter Enterprise, and IDEAS CAD.  The SLA will not include any requirements for software installation, software maintenance; on-site technical support, consulting/implementation services (managed services) and training.   NASA MSFC plans to continue the SLA with Unigraphics Solutions on a sole-source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	 1.  The aforementioned software has unique capabilities and is the only software available that will satisfy MSFC’s requirements.  Unigraphics functions that are or will be used in the design process include WAVE, Knowledge Fusion, Direct Modeling, Assembly Weight Management and User Defined Features.  Only Teamcenter Engineering has the capability to manage the multiple layers of file linking created by these features and their interactions.  Only VisView is integrally linked with Unigraphics NX and Teamcenter Engineering to extract all available information for non-CAD users. 2.  To procure other software would not be cost effective because approximately 200 users currently trained in the use of Unigraphics NX, Solid Edge, Teamcenter Engineering and other associated modules would have to be retrained to use other software.  In comparison to comparable vendors training prices, the cost to retrain these users is estimated at $500K plus severe loss of productivity during the extended learning curve required to transition to a different mechanical CAD package.  This will result in a substantial duplication of costs.  In addition, a considerable number of software libraries and customized programs have been developed to interface and integrate with Unigraphics, Solid Edge, Teamcenter Engineering and other associated modules.  Recreation of these libraries and customized programs to interface and integrate with any other applications would require a considerable amount of labor and would result in unacceptable delays since the use of this software greatly enhances the design process by reducing the design cycle and interaction time.  In the long term, lacking the demonstrated ability to reduce time and cut costs for the detailed design process, as well as the delay in technology development will jeopardize the capture of future development projects. 3.  UGS is the only source for the software and licenses.  In order for any other supplier to furnish MSFC with the software and licenses, it would have to procure the same from UGS and simply increase the cost with no value added.   Interested firms have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their capabilities and qualifications.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after the 15 days or without the required information will be considered nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:	  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in, and on behalf of, the District of Columbia. Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities. In executing this mission, CSOSA operates from leased spaces. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement shall be issued on or about the 24th of January 2005. A site visit will be scheduled within two weeks following issuance of the solicitation, with the specific day / date/ time provided in the RFP.  Source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15 shall be utilized for the award of the planned contract, using a trade-off between technical and price.  Technical evaluation criteria, in descending order of importance, are as follows: Technical Approach, Technical Qualifications, and Past Performance.  The technical evaluation criteria are equal in weight and, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The closer the technical ratings are to one another, the greater will be the importance of price in making an award determination. To be highly rated technically, firms shall demonstrate adequate technical ability, qualifications and past performance to establish their proposal will provide maximum benefit to the Government. The Government reserves the right to independently verify contractor past performance. The Request For Proposal will be available ONLY on the Internet at the FedBizzOpss website: http://www.eps.gov  Telephone, written or e-mail requests for a hardcopy of the solicitation will not be accepted.

The successful contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, and material to install an access control security system, and associated security equipment, at Karrick Hall. The installed system and accompanying equipment must be compatible with the present CSOSA legacy systems such as WINPAK 2.0 (release 3), PELCO systems (in order to control access), RADIONICS, as well as function with the existing proximity card making system, and CCTV system. The contractor shall be responsible for properly interfacing all system components, including required connectivity to 633 Indiana Avenue NW, Washington DC. An interface requires not only a physical connection, but also a matching of signals with regard to impedance, signal level, timing, synchronization and termination. The Contractor shall coordinate all installation and testing of the system with CSOSA Security staff. The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one-year warranty agreement on all new equipment. The Contractor shall also provide on-site service and repair within 24 hours of notice should a component fail during the one-year warranty period, except for any perimeter device that fails during the one-year warranty period. These devices will have a response on the same business day notified. The Contractor shall respond to all COTR requests for Emergency Service 100% of the time during the period of performance. The period of performance shall begin on or about 28 March 2005 and continue through approximately 30 August 2005, with staggered performance / delivery requirements. One year warranty services will commence after final acceptance of the security system and equipment. 

Firms must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive a government contract award. To register, visit the CCR website at: http://www.ccr.gov  This is unrestricted procurement; it is open to both large and small businesses.  Therefore, all responsible sources may respond to the Request for Proposal, once issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561621, Security Systems. The small business size standard is $10.5 Million average annual gross revenue over the last three completed fiscal years. If a large business firm is selected for award, the firm will be required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award. The subcontracting plan shall identify goals for Small Business (SB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Verteran-owned Small Business (VOSB) concerns. The required subcontracting plan from large business will be based on the successful contractor’s aggregate pricing.  Any planned subcontracting should support the mandatory Agency subcontracting goals of 23 percent for small businesses, with 5 percent for both women-owned and small disadvantaged businesses and 3 percent for HUBZone businesses.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis.  The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Pediatric Formulation of Potassium Iodide for children under the age of 10 years who live within a 20 mile radius of commercial nuclear power reactors that are included in the States with Potassium Iodide Distribution Programs. Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are also essential to life having influence on development, growth, and metabolism. If radioactive iodine (radioiodine) enters the body, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland. Radioiodine exposure to the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer or, if the radioactivity dose is large enough, destroy the thyroid gland. The population at highest risk for radioiodine exposure is children, due to the fact that children require thyroid hormone for normal growth and development. Following a nuclear detonation or reactor accident, several radioactive isotopes, including radioiodine, would be dispersed into the environment. One strategy developed to prevent incorporation of radioiodine into the thyroid gland is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive "stable" iodine so that if the thyroid is exposed to radioiodine, it will not take up radioiodine. The Government intends to enter into a sole source contract with the only currently known manufacturer of Potassium Iodide in a liquid formulation, Flemming and Company Pharmaceuticals of Fenton, Missouri. A commercial item award, resulting from a written RFP, with a base year and four option years is anticipated. The anticipated award date is on or about March 1, 2005. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement to Terrie Nestor at the e-mail address below by January 3, 2005. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis DHHS-ORDC-05-01 may be submitted to Terrie Nestor at (301) 402-6790 or in writing to tnestor@niaid.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory intends to award on the basis of other than full-and-open competition a contract to Horiba Jobin Yvon, Inc., Edison, NJ for a confocal Raman microprobe spectrometer system. Due to space constricts at the Naval Research Laboratory, the contractor must provide a single confocal Raman microprobe spectrometer system capable of XY mapping of small inhomogeneous samples at 0.1-micron steps over 75 x 50 mm2 of travel.  The system should also provide very high stray light rejection (via a double foremonochromator) at any excitation wavelength facilitating the analysis of very low frequency vibrational modes (within 10 cm-1 of the laser line).  Furthermore, the foremonochromator setup must ensure that only monochromatic excitation reaches the sample when performing resonance Raman excitation profile experiments in many, varied spectral regions, most specifically when the system is used in conjunction with tunable laser sources.   Because of the varied spectral regions to be studied, the system must have multiple detector ports (the system is to be outfitted initially with both a cooled 1024x256 pixel array open electrode CCD and an ambient temperature single channel InGaAs detector) for analysis of scattered light from the near-infrared (specifically 1064 nm) to the deep blue visible (~425 nm) spectral regions.  This system must also be amendable to allow for high-scattered light throughput (single monochromator, notch filter (1064 nm) design) when studying weakly scattering media such as thin films and glasses, and also be modular and easily upgradeable to increase spectral resolution capabilities as well as include chambers for the analysis of large samples.  Vendors who feel capable of providing the system stated above shall fully identify their interests and submit, in writing, information documenting their capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.     Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.   Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm Numbered Note 22 applies to this procurement.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 813990.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional support services for the National Information Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) on a sole source basis from the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO).  As the coordinating unit at the National Library of Medicine for the Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce (PIAPHW), NICHSR is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the PIAPHW Strategic Plan.  It is important to know the status of information technology in the local public health agencies.  Despite the enormous new pressures on public health agencies at the local level and the responsibilities of local public health agencies (LPHAs) as the first line of public health responders, little information exists on the status of the information technology infrastructure.  NACCHO conducted a nationwide electronic communications study in 1996; however, these data are woefully out-of-date.  There have been many landscape changes since that time, including an influx of emergency preparedness funds at the local and state levels.  Policymakers, program developers, and others need up-to-date and detailed data.  NICHSR plans to provide support to the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) which is the only national nonprofit organization representing local public health agencies (LPHA, including counties, cities, city/counties, districts, townships, and Tribal agencies).  NACCHO will provide an analysis of governmental local public health agency survey data related to information technology (current status and future needs).  NACCHO has conducted several large studies of local public health agency activities during the past two decades (Profiles, '89, '92, '97; Infrastructure Study, '99-2000).  The Profile is the only comprehensive source of data on local public health agencies.  NACCHO will conduct another Profile study in 2005 with funding already awarded by another government agency separate from the proposed procurement.  Data from this Profile will be mined for this information technology infrastructure project.  Thus NACCHO brings to the project the critical knowledge, experience, and subject expertise, as well as the unique resources to:  1) communicate directly with their membership in print and electronic media; 2) mine data on information needs and Internet connectivity from existing proprietary membership surveys; and 3) disseminate information via their members' only website.  The purpose of this agreement is to obtain an understanding of the current status of information technology in local public health agencies and identify future needs.  The result of this survey will be published in a research brief which will be disseminated.  NICHSR has identified NACCHO as having the requisite experience, knowledge and skills to perform this task.  NACCHO is uniquely qualified to provide an analysis of governmental local public health agency survey data related to information technology (current status and future needs) in the shortest possible timeframe and at least cost.  VALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price or cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to allow the NLM to evaluate the following criteria for award.  Criterion A:  (50 points) - Vendor must have an established means of communicating with local public health agencies.  Criterion B: (50 points) - Vendor must have experience performing a national survey of local public health agencies within the last 10 years addressing the information technology needs of the public health workforce.  The base period of performance shall be 12 months, with option for one successive one-year period.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  The Statement of Work (SOW) of this requirement is available to download at NLM Small Purchases (Simplified Acquisitions) web site: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/oam/oam.html.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions -Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) (October 2004).

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) and to subsequently award a subcontract to provide the services generally described below to pre-qualified bidders only.

To be deemed pre-qualified to receive the RFP, potential bidders are invited to provide such documentation necessary to demonstrate ability to meet each element of the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) specific pre-qualification criteria set forth below.

The contemplated subcontract will include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following information and criteria.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

As Prime Contractor for the Yucca Mountain Project (Project), BSC¡¦s task is to obtain licenses through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to construct and operate a radioactive waste repository. This requires the Project¡¦s licensing-related products to be accurate, complete, transparent, traceable, and compliant with regulatory requirements.

SCOPE OF WORK DEFINITION:

Technical professional services are required to assist BSC¡¦s Repository Development (RD) team in the development of licensing strategies for the Project to be used to defend the License Application.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Ms. Giao Thi Yen, General Director, Ho Chi Minh City Investment Fund for Urban Development, 33-39 Pasteur Str., District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Phone: (84-8) 821-4248, Fax:  (84-8) 821-4243.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance to examine Vietnam’s legal, regulatory and institutional framework for sub-sovereign financing, perform a case study of Ho Chi Minh City’s (HCMC) municipal bond issuance, and review the possibility of revenue-backed infrastructure financing for other cities in Vietnam.  .

Developing-country governments and donor countries have shown a growing interest in addressing sub-sovereign financing issues.  This interest reflects fiscal decentralization and increasing concerns by local governments to improve access to financial markets, attract capital, and involve the private sector in participation in infrastructure development at the provincial and municipal levels.

In 2003, the World Bank conducted a stocktaking reconnaissance study to examine the current status of and future prospects for sub-sovereign debt finance of infrastructure in four East Asian countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  The Bank examined existing studies and project reports to identify the most promising areas for involvement.  The study updated prior investigations with the goal of generating realistic plans that will help countries to access domestic financial markets.  The Bank’s work provides the foundation for this Sub-Sovereign Urban and Infrastructure Financing technical assistance.  

The Government of Vietnam since requested sub-sovereign financing assistance from the Bank.  In particular, it requested a review of HCMC’s recent municipal bond issuance in view of improving its subsequent issue.  It would also like to replicate a similar model for other provincial-status large cities such as Hanoi and Haiphong.  The proposed U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) technical assistance would assemble the latest information and assess the best path for promoting or accommodating local government access to the credit markets, including a case study on HCMC.  The other critical component of the assistance is to suggest how existing national, multinational, and bilateral credit assistance programs might be modified to support the development of private-market access.

The purpose of this assistance is to examine Vietnam’s legal, regulatory and institutional framework for sub-sovereign financing, perform a case study of HCMC’s municipal bond issuance, and review the possibility of revenue-backed infrastructure financing for other cities in Vietnam.  One objective of this assistance is to identify infrastructure projects that could be developed through the issuance of municipal bonds.  The Terms of Reference (TOR) for this technical assistance is attached at Annex 5, as part of the Grant Agreement.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 P.M., JANUARY 13, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>CONDUCT SITE SURVEYS, DESIGN, FABRICATE, CONSTRUCT, INSTALL, TEST , MW ANTENNA SYSTEMS, AT VARIOUS BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS (BBG), TRANSMITTING STATIONS LOCATED WORLDWIDE.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, DO NOT SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR SOLICITATION.  The U.S. Government Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Office of Contracts (M/CON) is conducting a market survey to determine the existence of sources to meet a multi-year BBG requirement for a range of Medium Wave (MW) Antenna Systems for installation worldwide.  The Government contemplates awarding two or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order type contracts.  It is anticipated that multiple Task Orders for MW Antenna Systems will be awarded during the Base Year and each of the four (4) Option Years if exercised.  Consequently, the results of the market survey will be used to determine which sources will be included in a competitive acquisition.  Subject to availability of funds, it is anticipated that the majority of task orders issued under the resultant contracts will be issued near the end or the beginning of the US Government's Fiscal Year (October 1 through September 30).  The awarded contracts will include a general scope of work of the BBG MW antenna systems requirement. However, each individual Task Order that is awarded will include a more detailed scope of work specific to the identified location where the requirement exist and will be competed among the contractors that are selected for a contract award.  The BBG requires MW Antenna Systems that include, but are not limited to:  towers including guys, anchors, foundations; antenna tuning units (ATUs) including all shelters, components and interfaces; transmission lines including supports.  The Contractor must demonstrate the capability of fabricating all antenna system components, delivery, construction, installation, and testing of MW Antenna Systems at BBG locations worldwide.   The contractor will provide the necessary project management, engineering support, systems integration, documentation, labor, materials, tools, equipment, spares, transportation, shipping and training required to deliver a complete MW Antenna System composed of either single or multiple tower arrays providing omni-directional, directional, and/or switched patterns, capable of handling transmitter output power levels up to 1000 kW.   All antenna systems delivered shall be integrated with the MW transmitters and other broadcast equipment currently operating and/or being provided by the Government and/or other contractors at the specified BBG site.  The actual work to be performed, the time of such performance and the location of the work shall be determined by the Contracting Officer, who will issue formally executed Tasks Orders to the Contractor or Contractors that have received a contract award under this solicitation.  The only work authorized under the resultant contracts is that which is performed after receipt of such Task Orders.  The issuance of individual Task Orders under the resultant contracts will be accomplished in the following manner:  (1) BBG will request each Contractor that has received an award to provide both a cost and a technical proposal for the work described in a request for proposal for the individual Task Order within ten days after receipt of the request.  The request will include the basic MW antenna system design including available site-specific information, and a request to provide a firm-fixed-price and technical proposal. The contractor may have to conduct a site survey to complete its proposal; (2) The contractor shall submit its firm-fixed-price proposal and technical proposal for the individual task order, including a validation of the BBG MW antenna design, to the BBG Office of Contracts; (3) The BBG will separately but concurrently evaluate the proposals, and (4) The BBG Office of Contracts will issue a finalized Task Order to the Contractor that has been determined to offer the Best Value to the Government based on the technical merit, price and other factors stated in the contract and any additional factors included in the request for proposal for the specified task order; (5) After receipt of the finalized Task Order, the selected Contractor will proceed with the work specified in the Task Order.  Contractors NOT receiving an award under this Task Order remain eligible to compete for any subsequent BBG MW antenna requirements during the life of the contract. This market survey is for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal and is not considered a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for information or inquiry. The Government may limit follow-on procurement actions to Contractors that provide responsive submissions to this notice.

(2) TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: The Contractor shall submit data sheets, drawings, analyses and/or other documentation clearly describing their ability to provide a full range of the MW Antenna Systems.  The capabilities statement should provide appropriate technical documentation describing the ability of other proposed team members to meet the requirements of this proposed contract (e.g., tower component manufacturer, ATU supplier.)  (3) DELIVERY: The Contractor shall describe their understanding of the requirement and the task order process including a sample schedule showing typical delivery times.  (4) SAMPLE PROJECT: The Contractor should provide a sample project or project proposal based on previous or ongoing projects including design documentation, schematics, drawings/sketches/pictures, plans, price and project schedule.

To be considered in this market survey a written "Capabilities Statement" shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer at Broadcasting Board of Governors, Office of Contracts (M/CON), Switzer Building, Room 2529, 330 "C" Street, SW, Washington, DC 20237 by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST), January 7, 2005.  Submittals may be sent via facsimile or courier.  NO telephone responses are acceptable. If determined to be in the best interest of the Government, interested and qualified sources responding to this sources sought notice may be requested to provide follow-up information. Contractors will be notified on whether their written "Capabilities Statement," as verified by the IBB is responsive to this notice.  This notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for release of the RFP for Phase 2 of the IWN Procurement.

The government is conducting a competitive, three-phase acquisition on behalf of the Integrated Wireless Network (IWN) Joint Program Office (JPO), representing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).  The IWN will provide secure, seamless, interoperable, and reliable nationwide wireless communications in support of the Federal Agents and Officers engaged in law enforcement, protective services, homeland defense, and disaster response missions of the DHS, DOJ and Treasury.  The period of performance for this acquisition will be a base period of five years, with an additional five-year option.

A Phase 1 Advisory Downselect has been conducted and the Government has advised each respondent in writing either that it has been invited to participate in Phase 2 of the acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Notwithstanding the advice provided by the government, vendors identified as unlikely to be viable competitors, as well as other offerors, may still participate in Phase 2 as long as they recognize the inherent risks of doing so.    

As a result of the Phase 2 competition, the Government anticipates that it will award IDIQ contracts to two responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a third contract based on whether that proposal offers value to the government.  The IDIQ contractors will receive firm fixed price task orders for design of the first service area as part of Phase 3 of the acquisition.  The government reserves the right to award one contract at the end of the Phase 2 competition to a single IWN contractor if there is only one acceptable proposal.

Please see the website at http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/iwn/index.html for more detailed information pertaining to this procurement. 

The solicitation and all associated documents will be electronically issued and may be accessed on www.fedbizopps.gov on or about January 4, 2005.

<DESC>Synopsis.  See attached solicitation and attachments for full description of requirement.   

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts’ (AO) Office of Probation and Pretrial Services (OPPS) seeks to become a results-driven organization with a comprehensive outcome measurement framework.  The probation and pretrial services system currently conducts only limited assessment of the outcomes of its work.  Using a comprehensive outcome measurement framework is a best practice that is common in government and mandated for the executive branch.  The leadership of the system, at the 2000 and 2002 biennial national chiefs conferences, reported the importance of being committed to outcomes rather than activities.  

A national framework must be developed with established goals and measures and targets for specific outcomes and outputs.  Importantly, the Administrative Office must review results to determine what is working well and what needs improvement.  The review process should be periodic, structured, and conducted at senior and middle management levels, with clear feedback mechanisms.  Information technology upgrades should be made to obtain the desired data, and an analytical methodology developed.    

The focus of this contract is development of an outcome-based decision-making framework for the federal probation and pretrial services system.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Please refer all contracting related questions to Lt Jimmy Ober, (937) 255-2619  ext 3002, jimmy.ober@wpafb.af.mil and all technical related questions to the  Program Manager, Capt Joey Stengell, (937) 255-7210 ext. 3909  joey.stengell@wpafb.af.mil  The Aeronautical Systems Center intends to solicit and award a contract to  continue development activities for the Extended -1553 Databus project with the  objective of increasing the capability of the existing -1553 databus to perform  in accordance with real-time operating principles. Resultant enhancements will  be incorporated into a revised military standard and handbook for use in future  procurements. The goal is to cost-effectively enable the upgrading of legacy Air Force and  DoD mobile war fighting support platforms with additional capability that  adheres to real time operating system principles required in a network-centric  environment. The Government anticipates awarding a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)/IDIQ  contract.  The period of performance will be 10 years (5 year base and 5 option  years) with a value of $100M dollars. ƒÞ	The Contractor must be able to demonstrate the following: the  capability to demonstrate data throughput in excess of 200 megabits per second  (Mbps) without any compression over existing aircraft wiring while adhering to  a 10-12 bit error rate (BER), backward compatibility to the existing -1553  protocol, and adherence to real-time operating principles.  The contractor  shall have documented experience with complex development and integration  programs involving databus systems.  The contractor is required to provide  analysis, simulation, and hardware verification of his proposed baseline design  as part of his submittal. The design shall address the functional capabilities  defined in this RFI to reflect a low risk approach to meeting the requirements.  The contractor shall also provide a detailed road map that defines the  capabilities that need to be added to his product and integrated into revisions  to a new standard for at least two sets of standard revisions. These added  capabilities shall provide incremental improvements in performance,  flexibility, integration, and lowered overall development cost. Thirty days  after contract award the respondents must demonstrate multi-drop (thirty-one  terminals) and 200 Mbps capability without data compression.  These  demonstrations will be conducted under the conditions of 10-12 bit error rate  (BER), 328 feet (100 meters) of -1553 cable, and concurrency with operation of  standard -1553 data bus messages (1 Mbps) on the same wiring. Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed  twenty-five pages addressing the following areas: 1.	Real time engineering principles required ¡V this area must be  supported  by a complete mathematical foundation that provides a closed form solution.   End to end simulation and analysis must be provided to demonstrate the fidelity  of the submitter¡¦s design approach and selected engineering principles.  All  math and associated principles shall be presented in detail sufficient to prove  that all aspects are understood and that guaranteed predictable performance  will be provided for all functionality. a.	The contractor is required to provide analysis, simulation, and  hardware verification of his proposed baseline design and his utilization of  his selected real time engineering principals as part of his submittal. The  design shall address the functional capabilities defined in this RFI to reflect  a low risk approach to meeting the requirements. b.	The contractor will define his approach to reducing overall development  cost of avionics with use of his implementation of real time engineering  principles. This approach will provide a closed form solution sufficient to  guarantee that performance is predictable and will accurately reflect actual  hardware operation.  2.	Functionality ¡V the following functionalities will be addressed  including the theory for guaranteed performance: a.	Design/theory for real time performance that includes graceful  degradation b.	End-to-end diagnostics (100% including wiring opens/shorts/degradation  with accurate fault isolation of 100% of failures/intermittents) c.	Wiring fault (open/short/degradation) location within an accuracy of  six inches d.	High utilization (greater than 60%)  3.	System engineering trades will be presented that identify the  contractor¡¦s proposed means for reducing the cost of system software testing  and development. Cost reductions should be presented in terms of overall  weapons system performance and should be within a range of 30 to 70 percent  savings as compared to existing software development activity.

<DESC>RN & LPN Question from previous amendment was revisited. In a earlier amendment, (Amendment #2 Page #3 Q10), a question was asked if the VA will provide RN and/or LPN if the patient required.  The answer to that question has changed.  The corrected is: Yes.  If the patient so requires the VA will include the RN or LPN as a part of it’s responsibility.  The contractor, for this particular requirement, is relieved of that responsibility.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE PREVIOUS NOTICE POSTED ON 12/08/2004. This is a request for information only. This not a Request For Proposal (RFP). The US Army PM Firefinder is seeking sources and information for an Objective Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (O-LCMR). The O-LCMR will be affordable, transportable radar. The O-LCMR system will be installed on a single host platform with assembly, alignment, initialization, and teardown being accomplished by one to two soliders quickly. The total system weight shall not exceed 500 pounds. Pieces and parts of the total system sh all be able to be combined to provide a stand alone, battery operated capability. This stand alone mission essential configuration shall weigh no more than 150 pounds with a goal of 120 pounds. The system in either configuration shall be fully operational in five minutes when emplaced by two operators, 10 min when emplaced by one operator, without the use of tools. The system shall be completely broken down and ready for movement within three minutes by two operators. The O-LCMR shall have the capability to  provide 360-degree coverage.  The O-LCMR should have digital connectivity and day/night mortar, cannon, and rocket counter-fire target acquisition functions.  The radar will be capable of supporting Forcible, Early Entry forces in urban and complex clutte r/ terrain, and be ruggedized to support these environments.  It is desirable that the O-LCMR System incorporate ground surveillance and intelligence information. The system shall be easily reconfigurable through mission planning software loads with no har dware changes. The radar system architecture shall be designed for future growth potential. The radar system shall be capable of interacting with mission planning software and an external radar environmental simulator (RESS). The radar system shall incorpo rate 'Self Locating/Self Survey Capabilities' using onboard GPS technology. The system should self locate to a fifth order of survey accuracy level and be capable of accepting survey data through manual download. Digital topographic data and meteorological  data shall be used and be easily imported into the system. To meet the mobility requirement, two systems shall be transported in a single HMMWV.  REQUIREMENTS:  Radar Functions: Counter-fire target acquisition of mortar fire, cannon and rocket targets. The O-LCMR shall have the ability to simultaneously search 360 degrees and perform hostile weapon location, observe and process friendly fire. The O-LCMR's primary mission is to detect, locate, and report enemy indirect fires. Its secondary mission is to provide accurate 'did hit' data of friendly fires and template/ record hostile locations. The O-LCMR shall have the ability to locate and classify threats according to target types, subtypes and have the capability of reporting back to the command and control node (Combat Net Radio). Target information shall also be stored for historical records. As a goal, the radar system shall be able to complete the basic elements  of transmitting, receiving, processing, and digital target reporting within 10 seconds (current MTP Standards) of weapon firing. Optimization of digital exchange with the Current and Future Combat System (FCS) shall be analyzed. Minimum and maximum ranges  should be 500 meters out to 10 km for artillery, mortars and cannons. The O-LCMR radar system will be capable of calculating launch point locations (LPLs) and friendly fire 'did hit data' within approximately a 25 meter or less Target Location Error (TLE)  at maximum range on mortars and 50 meters or less TLE at maximum range on cannon and rockets. In addition to the TLE requirement the system shall meet a Circular Error Probability requirement of 50%. System should have the capability of self-leveling to i ncrease accuracy. The antenna(s) for the O-LCMR shall be installed on the host platform and include a radome to protect system components from dust and the weather environment . The O-LCMR shall able to operate with no performance degradation when co-located with operational Firefinder radars. During co-located operation, a common display of data from both radars is desired to facilitate ease of soldier operation and target loca tion reporting.  The O-LCMR should be capable of digitally communicating its target location data via wireless to an operator with a laptop or hand-held, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) at a minimum distance of 1 km line-of-sight from the radar. It is des ired the O-LCMR have a capability to display situational awareness. The O-LCMR shall be able to be manipulated with the use of a laptop or PDA (active or standby mode, establish target priority sectors within the 360-degree coverage span, etc.) The O-LCMR shall be able to transmit 13-digit UTM target location coordinates with altitude digitally via a wireless and/or wired connection to an appropriate counter fire control authority (Mortar Ballistic Computer, Mortar Fire Control System, AFATDS, Future Force Battle Command System or equivalent). Multiple O-LCMR systems shall be able to operate in a local area network to perform their functions simultaneously. The O-LCMR shall have an inter-platform communication subsystem to perform cueing of targets to other nearby O-LCMRs.   Environmental Requirements: The O-LCMR system will be fielded to US Army personnel. Therefore, the O-LCMR shall operate in various environmental conditions Hot to +130 degrees Fahrenheit, Cold to -40 degrees Fahrenheit ('winterization' kit can be used for extreme cold weather operations). The O-LCMR shall be capable of withstanding the effects of salt spray, humidity, rain, salt fog, shock/vibration, dust, sand and fungi with full functionality. The O-LCMR shall have a 90 percent probability of operating fo r 72 continuous hours without an essential function failure in all environments. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components that can meet field test environments are encouraged but not mandatory. The O-LCMR will not contain radioactive materials, carcinoge nic or cancer suspect agents, or high toxic materials. Operating and maintaining the O-LCMR shall not cause unsafe conditions for the soldier. All hardware and software will be DII COE compliant. The O-LCMR shall have built-in low light level characteristi cs for night operations to facilitate light discipline.  The O-LCMR design architecture shall ensure a two level maintenance support concept which allows for modular/sub-component replacement of repairable and non-repairable parts in the field. The system design shall include a comprehensive built in test capability to ensure that the O-LCMR meets or exceeds a mean time to diagnose and repair at the operator level of 5 minutes and 30 minutes at the maintainer level. The O-LCMR shall not require preventive m aintenance higher than operator level. A tool kit and maintenance/cleaning kit will be provided. No special tools or test equipment shall be required. Maximum use of the Army inventory shall be made for any identified tools. Interactive Electronic Operator  and Technical Manuals (IETMS), on hard or compact disk) shall be provided to support operational and maintenance and training concepts. Embedded Training capabilities are required to support both institutional and sustainment training at national training  centers (HLA or DIS may be required). Unit training shall be able to be conducted by unit commanders in accordance with Army Readiness Training Evaluation Plan (ARTEP), Mission Training Plans (MTP), the IETMS, Soldiers Manual, and the Battalion Training M anagement System (BTMS). IETMS shall be tailored to ensure that periodic organizational, and depot-level maintenance functions can be cost effectively performed.  Supplements required to conduct 'leadership training' shall be developed to ensure that Army leaders remain tactically and technically proficient on the O-LCMR. Threat capabilities of an operational O-LCMR cover a spectrum from comm ercially available systems with military applications to sophisticated, state-of -the art supplied weapons, equipment, and other technologies such as directed energy weapons (DEW). It is desired that the O-LCMR be hardened to perform after exposure to phys ical destruction threats (use of conventional explosive ordnance, non-conventional ordnance (nuclear and chemical weapons).  The O-LCMR shall be operable and maintainable by personnel wearing protective equipment.  The O-LCMR system shall be able to withst and decontamination to the same extent as the RSOV and GMV.  The O-LCMR shall be able to perform its missions in an electronic warfare (EW) environment.  The O-LCMR shall operate in all modes without adverse effects or system degradation in a worldwide ele ctromagnetic environment encompassing both intrasystem and intersystem electromagnetic compatibility.  EW is the ability of an opponent to intercept, locate, and jam electronic signals.  Training shall include operation and maintenance of the O-LCMR colloc ated and operated with the AN/TPQ-36(V)8 radar system.  Actual training of personnel shall be conducted prior to user test.  	Prime Power Source: A HMMWV Generator/Battery shall be the power source, but the O-LCMR shall be able to use commercial power (50 -400 hertz) when available.  	Production Readiness Program: Six O-LCMR prototypes shall be built to provide adequate resources for a comprehensive government test program, and fabrication experience to ensure an immediate low rate production follow on program.  A drawing package and a  formal/ complete production readiness review shall be conducted.

<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:

Reference:  Request for Information (RFI) -- National Ordering and Vaccine Distribution System

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking information related to a new approach to vaccine ordering and distribution for the National Immunization Program (NIP).  

Background
The NIP distributes over 60 million doses of publicly funded vaccine through 64 immunization grantee projects per year.  This accounts for nearly 60% of all of the pediatric vaccine used in the United States.  As such, it is a key public health program for the nation, supported and overseen by the CDC NIP.  The program has been a success over the years— consistently raising provider enrollment in the Vaccine for Children (VFC) program, increasing access for eligible children, and working to improve national immunization levels.  However, the current distribution and ordering processes are decentralized and non-standardized, resulting in a number of challenges for management of the program.  

In response to the need for improved efficiency and to better oversee and utilize public health resources, a consolidated national ordering and distribution model is being considered. 

Please see the attachments for the actual Request for Information (RFI)letter, the draft statement of work (SOW), and the response sheet.

<CONTACT>John Sherman Contracting Officer 3032360225     John_Sherman@blm.gov;
<DESC>Sources sought for Information Technology Security Program Support Services Contract at the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of the Interior.  Sources sought will have the capability to provide nationwide coverage with a well qualified IT Security workforce at any DOI site in the United States, Virgin Islands and Okinawa.  DOI has approximately 2200 sites that may require visits and multiple sites that will require continuous presence at varying levels of effort.  Key personnel must have appropriate certifications, e.g., Project Management Professional for the successful offeror's Bureau/Office level Project Manager, Certified Information Systems Security Professional for lead or supervisory personnel working an assigned task, etc.  Other certifications may be deemed acceptable by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for Key personnel performing a technical function.  A single award purchase is essential for program services acquisition.  Contractor support must be simultaneously involved with multiple aspects of the BLM program else critical dependencies will likely be missed.  The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 states that federal organizations must implement an agency-wide IT Security Program that is applicable throughout the organization.  It states that developing and maintaining an agency-wide information security program is required  to satisfy the Government need of an integrated IT security program provider that can deliver a large quantity of consistent and integrated work across a variety of disciplines. This purchase addresses IT Security Support Services from a Program Level, not the sub-functions of the overall program.  The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Senior IT Security Officer are charged by the Federal Information Security Management Act to ensure establishing and maintaining an agency (Bureau) wide program which in turn implies that the program is integrated-that is-all functions are mutually supportive, consistent and presents strong evidence of continuity.  One of the prime purposes of this SOW is to provide the assistance to restructure, establish and implement such a program.  This would be difficult if not impossible with multiple awards.  Also, multiple awards tends to result in environments were critical dependencies in a task for one contractor are delayed by another.  A single contractor can adjust critical path items across multiple functional areas thus ensuring product delivery with the requisite quality assurance.  This results from the tight coupling of all IT Security Functions.  Furthermore, the DOI/ Bureau IT Security Program furnishes many of its services to the IT system or business owners.  Where services to a business owner may span many program sub-functions, splitting the Program Level requirements among multiple awardees will require multiple teams (of contractors) to interface with the business owner on assigned tasks.  This is not desirable from either a Program or Business owner standpoint as each looks to one team to be responsible for the assigned functions.  Also a multiple award will cause a lack of consistency, continuity and functional integration as well as potentially significantly increasing costs to the IT Security Program's customer.  Each of these aspects relate to major focuses of the FISMA, thus could also bring about a program failure and thus a violation of law. This procurement is targeted for firms that are on a GSA Schedule.  This requirement is a base year with 4 one year option periods.  You are requested to e-mail your interests with your firm's capability statements along with references where similar type and magnitude work was performed by your firm.  To request a copy of the draft statement of work you may e-mail your request to the Contracting Officer, John Sherman,  e-mail address John_Sherman@blm.gov

<DESC>COMMAND AIRCRAFT CREW TRAINING (CACT) PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND SIMULATOR TRAINING ON THE UC-12B/F/M AIRCRAFT


NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) has a requirement to support the Navy’s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) Program for academic and simulator training which includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for the Navy UC-12B/F/M aircraft (a Navy configured Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200).  
Currently, this requirement is being performed by FlightSafety International under Contract N61339-01-D-1004 and is due to expire on 31 May 2006.  Contract N61339-01-D-1004 also requires FSI to provide all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for the Navy C-20A/D aircraft (Gulfstream III DC and AC Models).  NAVAIR Orlando TSD plans to award a contract on a sole source basis to FlightSafety International to continue the UC-12B/F/M portion of contract N61339-01-D-1004.  This contract will have a base period of three (3) years with two (2) option years for a total of five (5) years of contract performance from 01 June 2006 through 31 May 2011.   The Navy plans to release a sources sought synopsis for the C20A/D portion of the contract on or around 01 October 2005 utilizing full and open competition with an RFT date of 01 June 2006.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, Section U.S.C, 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This action will ensure continuity of services to avoid any impact to current and future readiness of our Fleet and to avoid substantial duplication of effort that would be required to support the UC-12B/F/M Simulator development/reconfiguration and Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) curriculum.  FlightSafety International is the only responsible source that possesses a Navy configured UC-12B and the corporate knowledge and expertise necessary to maintain this level of Navy cockpit-specific UC-12 training continuity at the earliest possible date.  

A brief description of the UC-12B/F/M training requirements follows.  The specific individual courses required include: UC-12B/F/M Pilot Initial Training, UC-12B/F/M Pilot Initial Plus Training, UC-12B/F/M Pilot Recurrent Training, and UC-12B/F/M Aircrew Member/NFO Initial Training.   The UC-12 CACT Pilot and NFO program requires; classroom (academic and practical) training; Cockpit Familiarization Trainers (CFT) for the UC-12B, UC-12F and UC-12M models that depicts all cockpit systems to be used for cockpit familiarization and differences training; a UC-12B Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability); and an FAA Level “C” simulator.   In lieu of the PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level “C” or higher (as defined under FAA Advisory Circular 120-40B) for the Raytheon/Beechcraft King Air BE-200 configured to the Navy UC-12B cockpit. The flight simulator shall have an enhanced flight data package which provides realistic UC-12B flight characteristics and will be used in tasks that minimally include: visual flight maneuvering, instrument navigation, transition to land, engine out work, dynamic engine cuts, full stalls, upset recovery, post stall flying characteristics, and various emergency procedures. The simulator shall also be equipped with a collimated visual display system capable of projecting a minimum 180-degree horizontal by a 40-degree vertical field of view and simulate day-dusk-dawn-night and various seasonal weather conditions. The visual system database shall have navigational aids and airfields as specified by the Navy to include a worldwide database of generic airfields with greater visual details and higher fidelity for the UC-12 Local Operating Areas. 

The courses must be presented at a flight-training center with a demonstrated record of providing C-12 military pilot training at the time of training. All contractor pilot instructors shall have applicable Military C-12 Instructor Pilot experience.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabi for each course for government approval. Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the UC-12 NATOPS and Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.

This synopsis is issued to provide notice of NAVAIR Orlando TSD’s intent to award this contract on a sole source basis to FlightSafety International; THEREFORE, NO SOLICITATION WILL RESULT FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Questions or comments concerning this requirement should be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Paul Host, via email at paul.host@navy.mil or Contract Officer, Gary Wood at gary.wood@navy.mil or either by facsimile at (407) 380-4742 no later than 7 January 2005 for consideration.

<DESC>THIS IS A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT.  The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), the Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology Spectrum Efficient Technology Program Office, Edwards AFB, CA, is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience to design and build a working prototype of the Combined Coding Modulations System.  The Government requests industry qualification packages, which include references and proof of capability and experience in the area of Combined Coding Modulation Systems.  The package will not exceed 10 pages.     Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources.  Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience to design and build a flight capable working prototype of the Combined Coding Modulation System.  The CCMS is based on the work described in the following two papers.  
(a) Wilson, Sleeper, Schottler, Lyons, "Rate ¾ Convolutional Coding of 16-PSK:  Code Design and Performance Study", IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. COM-32, No.12, December 1984.
(b) Ungerboeck, G. "Channel Coding with Multi-level/phase Signals", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-28, pp.55-66, Jan. 1982.
 
The CCMS shall be compatible with non-linear RF power amplifiers in that the modulation will be constant envelope.  The proposed work is part of an ongoing research effort towards the establishment of bandwidth efficient modulations although the Government does not have any detailed data to provide.  The objectives shall include but are not limited to the following: 
 
1) Construct a CCMS modulator and demodulator.  The modulator and demodulator shall operate at a single frequency of 70 MHz.  The modulator package shall be provided as flight worthy in a mutually agreeable form factor.
2) Quantify the performance level of the approach with regard to bit error rate, occupied bandwidth and implementation complexity, in both the laboratory and airborne environments.
3) Evaluate the performance level in the non-linearly amplified (NLA) environment.
4) Perform comparisons of the technique with the ARTM-defined tier-1 and tier-2 modulations.
5)  Assemble and operate the system in the laboratory environment.  Prepare demonstration on the basis of Eb/No.
6)  Assess link performance and system integration.  Relate Eb/No metrics to system C/N and relate to range/performance.
 
Background: 
Within the T&E environment, the legacy equipments operate using PCM-FM, a specific variation of CPFSK, referred to as tier-0.  This modulation type, under all conditions relevant, exhibits a spectral efficiency of around 0.45 bits/sec/Hz.  The new modulations of SOQPSK and FQPSK, referred to as tier-1, exhibit about 0.91 bits/sec/Hz.  The most efficient modulation is the tier-2 modulation, multi-h CPM, now called ARTM CPM, exhibiting about 1.18 bits/sec/Hz.  Achieving tier-2 modulation is a large computational task, both on the modulation side, but most notably on the demodulation side.  This computational load has served to increase the cost of tier-2 modulation deployment substantially.
 
Screening Criteria for Qualification Packages are:   Extensive knowledge of 16-PSK modulation combined with error correction coding which are applicable to aeronautical telemetry; experience with optimizing wave shapes to simultaneously provide constant envelope signals, excellent detection efficiency, and implementation simplicity; proof that the system is scalable and is compatible with non-linear RF power amplifiers in that the modulation is constant envelope.  Provide a technique that shows high spectral efficiency in terms of bits/sec/Hz consistent with 16 PSK trellis coding techniques and true constant envelope operation.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.     The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), the Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology Spectrum Efficient Technology Program Office, Edwards AFB, CA, is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience to design and build a working prototype for a software re-configurable antenna system operating in the 4.5 and 7. 2 Ghz frequency band, using Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) switches to provide frequency re-configurability and beam steering for in-flight use.  The objective is to show that such a system will allow a more spectrally efficient communication between a flying vehicle and a ground station for telemetry application.  The Government requests industry qualification packages, which include references and proof of capability and experience in the area of Software Reconfigurable Antenna Systems (SRAS).   The package will not exceed 10 pages.     Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources.   The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources.   Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience to design and build a working prototype of the SRAS.    

1) Objective
The proposed research aims to design and build a working prototype of software reconfigurable antenna system operating in the 4.5 and 7.2 Ghz frequency band using MEMS switches to provide aircraft in-flight frequency reconfigurability and beam steering.  The design of the reconfigurable antenna architectures will be done by using full-wave electromagnetic analysis tools based on finite element method and method of moment.  The switches will be fabricated and integrated with the antenna.  The Reconfigurable antenna will consist of multiple distinct patches printed on a microwave substrate such as RT/Duroid or quartz connected by MEMS switches strategically placed on the same substrate.  When the switches are in the OFF-state the patch will resonate and radiate at one frequency (highest frequency).  When the switches are in the ON-state and the two patches are connected, the antenna will resonate and radiate at a different frequency (the lower frequency).  The beam switching functions will be done using a dual frequency Butler Matrix driven by a single pole 4 throw MEMS switch.  For demonstation purposes the system will have a computer system that will control the system to radiate signals to a predetermined ground antenna location.

2) Scope
The scope of the work to be pursued consists of demonstrating how MEMS switches can
effectively be integrated into a microwave antenna system to provide a reconfigurable frequency.  The work also will demonstrate how a proper bias scheme can be used in combination with MEMS switches to ensure a minimum interaction between the RF signal path and the MEMS DC bias lines.  This is not a trivial task and many MEMS related projects did not succeed simply because of the RF signal coupled with the bias lines degrading system performances. Because of the chosen geometry for the antenna (microstrip patch type), the switches to be built are of the type microstrip series switches and not shunt coplanar type.  This switch is fundamentally different from the shunt switch that has been demonstrated in the past.  A second scope of the proposed work is to demonstrate the design and fabrication of in-line switch and evaluate its performances at microwave frequency.  Of particular interest is the long term reliability of the MEMS switches and their power handling capability.  Additionally the overall power levels supported by the SRAS is of interest.

3) Background
The proposed work is part of ongoing research efforts towards the establishment of low cost, low profile, adaptive, and multifunctional communication systems with emphasis on reconfigurable phased array antennas.  Current research efforts have two main phases, which are interrelated to each other:
(1) Development of novel MEMS fabrication technologies for low cost, highly integrated, adaptive, and multifunctional communication systems.
(2) Design, analysis and fabrication of the communication systems compatible with the
developed fabrication technologies.
The above stated phase 1 of the research efforts is an ongoing project, in which 
novel MEMS fabrication technologies have been developed for the use in fabricating MEMS based reconfigurable communication systems.  Research has successfully demonstrated the integration of MEMS switches on several unconventional substrates such as quartz, printed circuit board and Rogers-Duroid.  The proposed research focuses on the design, analysis and fabrication phases are built on proven capabilities of utilizing full-wave electromagnetic tools.  University research work has designed many microwave circuits as well as RF MEM switches, and have also demonstrated the first MEMS switch integrated with antenna on printed circuit board materials.

Screening Criteria for Qualification Packages are:   Extensive knowledge of RF MEMS SRAS to aeronautical telemetry; demonstrated capability to design and fabricate a working prototype of software reconfigurable antenna system using MEMS switches on printed circuit board to provide frequency reconfigurability, beam steering and ability to modify the system within allotted schedule;  ability to test in an anechoic chamber; and the ability to provide engineering data packages to commercial vendors for product development and commercialization.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) for the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM).  The Product Manager, US Army Air Traffic Services is seeking information on industry capabilities to design, develop, produce, and maintain a Mobile Towe r System (MOTS).  The MOTS will be a highly mobile tactical system designed to rapidly set-up and quickly establish air traffic services (ATS) during the initial phases of deployment, and sustain those services throughout operations and redeployment.  The system will be mounted on a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV); accommodate three air traffic controllers and one supervisor in the tower; be C-130 deployable; UH-60 lift-capable; meet international Air Traffic Control (ATC) standards; and contain modernized, digital jam-resistant communications.  The MOTS will be capable of sustained 24-hour operations in a day, night (aided or unaided eye), and under inclement weather environments. The MOTS shelter will be capable of removal (conduct stand -alone operations) when the HMMWV is disabled, requires maintenance, is used for other transport, or the system is to be semi-permanently emplaced.  The MOTS will serve as a replacement system for both the AN/TSW-7A ATC Central and the AN/TSQ-70A Aircraft Control Central.   The MOTS mission is to provide air traffic services (ATS) in airspace designated for air traffic movement at terminal areas of the division, corps, echelons above corps (EAC), during wartime and during stability and support operations (SASO).  The MOTS wil l meet federal aviation administration (FAA)/international civil aviation organization (CAO) requirements for integration into the national/host nation airspace systems.  The MOTS, along with the Tactical Terminal Control System (TTCS) and Air Traffic Navi gation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS), will also integrate with the Army's area airspace management system, Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS), to form a network that provides management of the airspace over an area of operation. In peacetime operations, the MOTS will support Army ATS training requirements and Aviation units through tactical field training exercises.  The MOTS will also support other agencies, host nation, joint services, and other Army missions as required.  For e xample, the MOTS will be used to provide temporary ATC services at fixed-base installations during periods of extended downtime due to fixed-base system outages and facility modernization. The services provided include:  Sequencing and separating arriving and departing aircraft, coordinating instrument meteorological condition (IMC) recovery of aircraft, and coordinating in-flight emergencies, search and rescue (SAR) and combat search and re scue (CSAR) actions.  The MOTS will also be tasked with the rapid restoral of terminal ATC operations during missions such as disaster relief or other nonmilitary operations.   The MOTS voice communications systems include:       1.  A simulcast capability on two active frequencies in each of the UHF-AM, VHF-AM and VHF-FM bands.      2.  Additional backup radios for each frequency band.      3.  An additional capability will exist to independently and continuously monitor/receive and transmit on emergency (guard) frequencies in each of the UHF-AM and VHF-AM bands; independently receive and transmit on VHF-FM for TAIS; battle command, guar d, or crash/fire/rescue communications.        4.  The system will also equipped and capable of HF/SSB with ALE/NOE and UHF-FM SATCOM DAMA communications. The MOTS will have a basic capability of illuminating a runway or landing area by operating existing surface lighting through a limited control panel and interconnect or through a portable airfield lighting system.  The operational definition of this airfi eld lighting capability includes: 1.  Configurable to serve a runway and/or landing zone (LZ)/drop zone (DZ)/pickup zone (PZ). 2.  Provide green, unidire ctional threshold; white, omnidirectional edge; and red, unidirectional end lights that operate in visual (unaided eye), infrared (aided eye), and NVD (aided eye) modes.  The threshold and end lights must be configurable to allow for a change of runway dir ection without movement of the emplaced lights. 3.  Provide lights to mark (up to) a 5,000-foot runway for instrument operations.  The primary system will allow the integration and operation of a second lighting system to light a 10,000-foot runway.  Runway and LZ/DZ/PZ configuration will share common e dge lights. 4.  Provide glideslope and courseline visual (unaided and aided) cues that delineate a safe corridor (up to) a 10-nautical mile (NM) final approach-to-landing.  Runway and LZ/PZ configurations will share common glideslope and courseline equipment. 5.  Provide glideslope and courseline visual (unaided and aided) cues that are easy and understandable for aviators to acquire and maintain, and clearly differentiate between, relative positions of high, on glideslope, low, left, oncourse, and right, respe ctively.   6.  Provide a simple and certifiable process for the ground operator to initially align and maintain the glideslope and courseline (after equipment setup), without the use of external tools, devices, or equipment.  Glideslope and courseline equipment movem ent, setup, and alignment (due to a change in runway direction) will be accomplished in less than 30 minutes. 7.  Operate wired into the MOTS lighting control panel; using a surface-based hand-held remote up to 2 NM away; and from an aircraft cockpit, up to10 NM away.  The surface-based operator will be able to override or lockout the control abilities of the airb orne user. 8.   Operate, powered by commercial power; tactical or generator power; solar power; and internal, rechargeable batteries. 9.   Provide 12 hours of continuous, internal battery operation in hot, basic, and extreme cold climates before recharging and in all weather conditions. 10.  Transportable by HMMWV towed trailer, transit cases/bags, and manpack.  The LZ/DZ/PZ configuration will fit in two large Army rucksacks carried by two soldiers. 11.  Setup and operate by three soldiers in no more than 45 minutes on a 5,000-foot runway.  Setup and operate by two soldiers in no more than 15 minutes on a LZ/DZ/PZ (one inverted Y and one helipad). 12.  Meet FAA and ICAO lighting standards.

<SUBJECT>A -- Women's Health Initiative Study on Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) Extension
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate with Wake Forest University (WFU) School of Medicine for a two year extension of their existing contract number N01-AG-9-2115 titled “Effects of Hormone Replacement Therapy on Cognitive Aging: Women’s Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA)”.  The original contract was to collect ancillary data (neuropsychological assessments) to the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) which was conducted by WFU with private funding.  This extension will allow for up to 3 additional annual neuropsychological assessments.  The appropriate statutory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302.1(a)(2) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i).  The cited authority is applicable because Wake Forest University (WFU) School of Medicine is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract extension.  WHIMS was initiated by and is coordinated through WFU and WFU continues to perform this study. The data to be acquired under the proposed contract extension must use the same participants to continue to collect cognitive data.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  If, however, there are any responsible sources who feel they possess the abilities which would enable them to perform this project, they may submit a proposal which will be considered by NIH.  SEE NUMBERED NOTE 22.

Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland
Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)     The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

Proposals shall specifically address each of the Required Technical Qualifications above as they relate to each proposed individual.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Pipe Coverer and Insulators/Lead Pipe Coverer and Insulator.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum three (3) qualified Pipe Coverer and Insulators and a Lead Pipe Coverer and Insulator within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.

Estimated overtime for Pipe Coverer and Insulators is 260 hours for Pipe Coverer and Insulators and 260 hours for Lead Pipe Coverer and Insulator.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.    Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Pipe Coverer and Insulators/Lead Pipe Coverer and Insulator shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Pipe Coverer and Insulators are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered.  The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 260 for Pipe Coverer and Insulators and 260 for the Lead Pipe Coverer and Insulator.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

              w1908)?
     Answer:  There is no specific frame number for this 
              requirement. The selection of the frame will be 
              based on the samples each offeror submits and

            discretion of the offeror. There is no requirement 
            for a particular manufacturer of the w1908.

4. Question: Can you please tell us more about the V-groove 
             matte? Can we see a sample at GAO if we visit? Does 
             it have a number?

              that boarders the letter or certificate.It is white

The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6	USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1	The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1	assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a    feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2	assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections 3.1 through 3.15.

2.6.2	Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.2.1 	be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.2.2	represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.2.3	be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

USTDA is looking to hire a DM team to travel to Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania to investigate mining and mining infrastructure sector opportunities for possible USTDA assistance.  The definitional mission will analyze potential opportunities involved with major mining operations or principle mining companies in each country.  The definitional mission will also consider infrastructure development projects that are related to current and/or planned mining operations.  USTDA assistance could open new opportunities for U.S. firms and support the development priorities for this important sector in these countries.  The selected DM consultant will be expected to travel to the region by late winter/early spring of 2005.  It is recommend at less a week of travel be allotted for each country.  

Senegal

The minerals industry represents over 20% of Senegal’s GDP and 20% of its annual exports.  Senegal’s mineral resources include: phosphates, gold, and iron ore.  Phosphate production currently dominates the mining sector in Senegal.  The industry is vertically integrated with phosphates being converted into phosphoric acid and fertilizer within the country at respective factories.  After conversion, phosphoric acid and fertilizer is exported primarily to India and Japan.

Industries Chimiques du Senegal (ICS) is one of the two largest companies in Senegal.  ICS is a private company that has served in the past as a USTDA grantee.  ICS has requested USTDA consider providing assistance towards three activities: a pilot project for the development of a process to remove cadmium from phosphoric acid, an HSF plant which would convert fluosilicic acid to anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, and involvement with the planning of new $100 million phosphate mine at Matam.  The DM consultant would review these three opportunities, as well as provide a brief report on the status of the results of the previous feasibility study for which USTDA provided funding.
    
Senegal is promoting a new iron ore mining project, which is commonly referenced as the Miferso project.  Miferso is a government of Senegal-owned project development company with rights to develop the Faleme iron ore project.  The Faleme project consists of three elements: a mine and associated infrastructure, strengthening of existing rail line and 311km of new rail line, and a new deepwater port complex able to process iron ore exports.  Preliminary total project cost estimates are $950 million, with the mine accounting for $306 million, rail and rolling stock accounting for $537 million, and the port complex accounting for $107 million.  Kumba Resources (South Africa) has been selected by the GOS to develop the mine and related infrastructure.

Since 2003, Transrail has been the private consortium that operates the railway between Dakar and Bamako, Mali.  Transrail is partly owned by CANAC (Canada), which was bought out by Savage Services Corporation (Salt Lake City, UT) in April 2004.  With the acquisition of CANAC, Savage became a partial owner of Transrail and represents one of the largest U.S. investors in Senegal.  The DM consultant will be expected to contact Savage to discuss any potential collaboration between Savage and USTDA, while also considering the entire project.  

Mali

Mali is rich in natural resources, including gold, phosphates, bauxite, iron ore, limestone, and manganese, however gold and phosphate mining have seen significant development in the country.  After cotton, gold is Mali’s second most exported commodity and Mali is the third largest producer of gold in Africa (after Ghana and South Africa).  Gold and other mineral exploration is ongoing, however poor infrastructure has limited interest for new ventures.    

The team of RandGold and AngloGold, both South African firms, currently represents the largest foreign investor in the mining sector of Mali.  The firms have been active in Mali for over ten years and their total investment in the country is expected to reach $300 million by the end of 2004.  The Rand/Anglo consortium has retained 45% ownership of the largest gold mining operation in the country, at Morila, and is currently developing a new mining operation at Loulo at an estimated cost of $80 million.  However, for all mining operations, the government of Mali retains partial ownership.  The Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Water Resources has requested USTDA assistance specifically with an analysis and development of a national program for gold resources in Mali.  The selected DM consultant will analyze this request in detail, keeping in mind areas within the sector where U.S. firms may be competitive in follow-on activities.  The DM consultant will also investigate infrastructure development projects related to the mining sector in Mali that may be appropriate for USTDA assistance. 

Mauritania
   
Mauritania contains a diverse range of mineral products, however poor infrastructure has greatly hindered development of the industry.  Diamonds, gold, and iron ore are the only three minerals currently being developed.  Iron ore mining and beneficiation accounts for 12% of the country’s GNP and 40% of its annual exports.  

Iron ore is the most widespread mineral in the country.  Iron ore mining, production, and beneficiation is owned and controlled by the government of Mauritania through Societe Nationale Industrielle et Miniere (SNIM).  SNIM’s primary export market is European countries.  In recent years, foreign mining firms (South African and Australian) have shown great interest in Mauritania’s iron ore industry and joint venture and/or independent concession talks have been underway.  

Several large gold mining projects currently exist or are in development within Mauritania.  Unlike the iron ore industry in Mauritania, the gold industry is dominated by foreign companies, of which Australian firms are best established.  

In consideration of all mineral development projects in Mauritania, vitally needed infrastructure improvements such as to the railway network and port infrastructure are lacking.  USTDA’s assistance with upgrading the infrastructure related to mining operations in the country may entice interest in Mauritania for U.S. firms for both mining infrastructure-related projects and potentially for mining projects as well.
