<CONTACT>Sherry Gossett Contract Specialist 7022938348     sgossett@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The western yellow-billed cuckoo is a neo-tropical migrant species that breeds in deciduous woodlands, restricted to riparian habitat that lines rivers and streams in the western United States.  Yellow-billed cuckoo populations in the western United States have declined dramatically over the last 100 years.  In 2001, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the western yellow-billed cuckoo warrants protection under the Endangered Species Act as threatened, but precluded by higher priority actions. Cuckoos are listed as endangered by the Nevada Natural Heritage Program, as endangered by the California Department of Fish and Game, and a species of special concern by the Arizona Game and Fish Department.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, has a requirement for a base and four option years to perform biological monitoring of the western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis) along the lower Colorado River as it exits the Grand Canyon in Lake Mead to the United States-Mexico Southerly International Border to determine long-term population trends.  Yellow-billed cuckoo surveys shall be conducted following Halterman et al. 2007, Western Yellow-billed Cuckoo Natural History Summary and Survey Methodology. This survey protocol requires a minimum of four surveys at each site, one during each period (10 - 30 June, 1 - 21 July, 22 -11 August, and 12 August - 2 September) to document presence/absence of yellow-billed cuckoos at approximately 55 sites within 17 study areas.  Four visits is the minimum necessary to determine with relative confidence that cuckoos are probably not breeding at a site in that year.  Vegetation monitoring and microclimate data shall also be collected in nesting areas to determine specific habitat requirements of the cuckoo.  The Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program Habitat Conservation Plan requires the Bureau of Reclamation to restore 5,940 of cottonwood-willow habitat, including 4,050 acres specifically for the yellow-billed cuckoo.  For this project, breeding habitat characteristics of the cuckoo need to be determined to aid and evaluate the success of current and future restoration projects on the lower Colorado River.  This will be a "best value" procurement with award based on past performance, knowledge of desert riparian systems and biological inventorying and monitoring techniques, education requirement for the team leader and technician, skill in monitoring of low density bird populations and price.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important that cost or price.  The solicitation is unrestricted.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 and the related small business size standard in dollars is $6.5 Million.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement.  Prospective firms must be registered in CCR prior to award and complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at "http://www.bpn.gov".  The point of contact for this acquisition is Sherry Gossett at (702) 293-8348, e-mail address is sgossett@lc.usbr.gov.   It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be ready for release on or about October 01, 2007.  To obtain a copy of the RFQ, please go to the website at National Business Center Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at "http://www.fedbizopps.gov" or visit our website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

DPN Engineering Services:  The contractor shall provide for the D PN, Network Operation Center (NOC) in Iraq and Rapid Expansion of cellular telephone network.  The DPN is Ericson AXE  810 digital cellular telephone system with  Radio Base Station (RBS) capacity of the 96 instantaneous call used as a command and control  tool by MOD and the Iraqi armed forces (IAF).  The system currently supports eighteen (18) different locations with allowances for future expansion for approxi mately 50,000 total IAF personnel and Coalition support staff.  Currently, the DPN consists of 18 geographically dispersed, self-sustaining switching centers, each with a tower, switching shelter, radio base station, and backup generator.  The following se rvices are required: create a Tier II-Level NOC; expand services to at least 4 new locations with 10KM coverage area, including 250 Nokia GSM Cell phones with sim chips for each site; provide normal level of connectivity redundancy to five existing orphan site, and provide secure mobile telephony services across the entire network.  The proposed solution(s) will be compatible with existing hardware and software now in use by the DPN and be scalable to support any future network growth.  Services shall be ex panded to at least 4 new locations, and normal level of connectivity redundancy shall be provided to 5 existing orphan sites.  Secure mobile telephony services shall be provided across the entire network.  The contractor shall provide vehicles for transpor tation of personnel and equipment in and around Iraq for the conduct of meeting any and all requirements of this expansion.  The contractor shall supply a list of employees to be approved by the Iraqi Government.  The contractor shall be required to perfor m this contract during war or state of emergency.  The current DPN has been implemented in two stages, the first being the original thirteen sites and the second consisting of a five site expansion for a total of eighteen (18) sites.  The original eleven s ites are currently fully meshed with each other (via a VSAT and Microwave transport layer) and the five expansion sites are connected through a VSAT Hub and are not currently meshed with the original eleven sites.  Hence, these five sites are treated as o rphan sites.  The customer is requesting that these orphan sites be integrated in to the meshed network topology of the original eleven sites.  In addition, the customer is requesting that four new (expansion) sites be added to the network bringing the total number of site up to twenty-two.  These sites will also need to be integrated in to this meshed network topology.  The purpose of this completely meshed topology is to provide the capability of secured telephony on the GSM network.  Currently the net work topology will not support encryption due to the latency of the transport layer of the orphaned sites.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for technical representative services at Ellington Field to support maintenance of the General Electric J-85 Engines installed in NASA/JSC's T-38N Fleet. The technical representative is required to function as a liaison between General Electric and NASA/JSC personnel.  The period of performance for this requirement is one year.  The period of performance begins January 1, 2008 and ends December 31, 2008. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the service from General Electric on a sole source basis. This determination was reached based on the fact that General Electric has all of the proprietary information rights for General Electric J-85 Engines. This proprietary information is unobtainable from sources outside of General Electric. Thus, General Electric is the only known source capable of meeting all of NASA/JSC's requirements for this procurement. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 9th, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The goal of this program is to develop and demonstrate innovative ultra-lightweight JP-8 fueled generator technology that is single-person portable for Marine Corps reconnaissance missions and remote sensors.  Many missions in remote locations are currently limited by the amount of power that can be carried on foot and/or left in place for unattended equipment operation.  Advanced rechargeable batteries are anticipated to significantly reduce the weight of batteries for Marine Corps Expeditionary units.  However, the lack of a sufficiently energetic power source that is not tied to a wall outlet or vehicle prevents on-foot expeditionary units from taking advantage of rechargeable battery technologies in the field.  The need to send personnel units (on foot or by vehicle) out to service batteries in remotely fielded sensors and equipment presents significant logistics and safety burdens and high cost.  

A 500-1000 Watt single person-portable, compact, lightweight, low signature (acoustic, thermal, and magnetic), JP-8 fueled generator would enable a significant reduction in the weight and cost of fielded batteries for expeditionary units and longer-term operation of remote sensors, limited only by the size of the fuel tank.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Region II, intends to negotiate with Stanley Security Solutions, 350 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY on a sole-source basis for replacing and upgrading the access control systems consisting of card readers, magnetic locks, push buttons, contact alarms, wiring, and integration at the Addabbo Federal Building located in Jamaica, Queens, New York. These varied components must integrate with existing building design, space and appurtenances established for system repair or modification. Stanley Security Solutions currently maintains the security equipment systems at the Addabbo Building under a five-year contract as the on-site subcontractor to Brooks Range Contract Services, SSA's mechanical maintenance contractor. Stanley Security Solutions installed and performed alterations to the existing system components several years ago and is fully responsible for all aspects of the operation and maintenance of the system. Since the original equipment has been maintained by one contractor, Stanley Security Solutions, SSA intends to negotiate directly with Stanley Security Solutions so as to comply with contractual (Maintenance & Warranty) agreements already in place, and ensure a smooth and rapid response and clear line of accountability for all breakdowns, thus minimizing disruption to operations, while maintaining limited down time of access control systems. Few manufactured items are common between various manufacturers' systems, meaning that systems from different manufacturers that operate to a proprietary design are not interchangeable with each other. These are systems that must be integrated with existing building characteristics or agency operating requirements. The Government will consider all information from responsible sources that is submitted to the point of contact by September 29, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President’s hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the Pres!  ident’s initiative by being a ”first adopter” of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $2-4 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is exploring the availability of commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to lighter weight alternatives to the current steel alloy Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft MB-1 and MB-2 (10,000 and 25,000 pound capacities, respectively) cargo tie-down chain/device combinations (found in Detail Military Specifications (Mil-DTL)-6458E and -25959).  The intent of this initiative is to reduce aircraft operating weight to improve MAF fuel efficiency.  The lighter weight alternative tie down sought must perform to the general performance specifications contained in section 4.5 of Mil-DTL-6458E and section 4.7 of Mil-DTL-25959F (attached separately).  Any reference to specific materials, mechanisms, or assemblies can be disregarded in lieu of proposed new lighter weight device.  Through this RFI, the Air Force is requesting information concerning technologies which meet the requirements previously stated.  

This Request For Information (RFI) may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.   SUBMISSIONS: Product information may be submitted until 21 Sep 07.  RFIs should not exceed five pages and should include cost estimates.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Include the RFI identification number, company information (address, phone number, e-mail) as well as the company?s primary point of contact for this project.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the Air Mobility Battlelab at battlelab@mcguire.af.mil.  
THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS CAPT JESSICA WILLIAMS.  You may contact Capt Williams with any questions at (609) 754-7938 or jessica.williams2@mcguire.af.mil.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL AMB INFORMATION: The United States Air Force (USAF) AMB is the MAF catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  The AMB strongly encourages partnering with companies to complete demonstrations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), cooperative agreements, or bailment agreements, but does have a small budget to purchase COTS/GOTS-derived hardware.

GENERAL RFI INFORMATION:     The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

I am interested in constructive comments and your concerns.  This survey is for information purposes only and the Government WILL NOT pay for the information requested. Although "proposal" is used in this request for information, your responses will be treated as information only.

1.Given the fluctuating cost of materials for these items, what would be a suitable base contract period? Graphite, steel and nickel are the materials that are used on the majority of the items. ONE YEAR  TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS

2.How many contract extensions would you consider? Each contract extension (option) is for one year. ONE OPTION, TWO OPTIONS, THREE OPTIONS OR FOUR OPTIONS

3. What are some of the technical changes /trends occuring in the gasket industry that would have an impace on the proposed contract?

4. Do you require a minimum dollar value / quantity on these items?

5. Typically, the long term contracts allow for an economic price adjustment. The adjustment is based on the Department of Labor's Producer Price Index. Which indexes, if any, do you use to develop pricing and monitor industry activity?

6.Do you believe the Producer Price Index is an appropriate method for determing price adjustments? why?
7.Other than the Government, what other industries use Spiral Wound Gaskets?
8. Do you have a commercial catalog that indicated the prices of these items?
9. What are the commercial practices that are used to acquire these items for a long term contract?

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source commercial items contract to Eaton Electric, Inc. located at 8609 Six Forks Road, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27615 to provide maintenance and service of four 2000 KVA Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) designed, installed, and modified by Eaton Electrical, Inc., formerly Exide, and all associated equipment in SSA's National Computer Center located in Baltimore, Maryland.   The equipment includes an Exide Electronics 8000 kva redundant solid state UPS system, associated microprocessor-based self diagnostic package (Data Trax), four 192 battery sub-systems, Cell Watch battery monitoring system, Hot Tie and all related breakers and switchgear. 
Eaton Electric Inc. (formerly "Exide Electronics" and "Powerware") have been performing preventative and remedial maintenance and repairs on the SSA/NCC UPS system since it was installed in 1978.  Exide Electronics designed, installed and tested the original UPS system.   Exide Electronics upgraded the UPS system currently in operation at the NCC to a more efficient and reliable unit in 1993.  In 1996 the logic cards were upgraded to the newest system used today.  In 1999 a "Hot Tie" system was installed to further protect the critical load of the NCC.  Powerware engineers and technicians did the design, installation and testing of the modified system.  After the upgrades, the UPS became a more efficient and reliable running unit, however the upgrading of the UPS did involve proto type circuitry that was designed and manufactured solely by Powerware Corporation.  All technical information, schematics, printed circuit boards and software is proprietary and is only available through Eaton Electric Inc. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13. It is SSA's belief that Eaton Electric is the only source qualified to meet our needs because of its' ability to service hardware and software which is of a proprietary nature.  This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to Kimberly Huttenberger via email at Kimberly.Huttenberger@ssa.gov no later than 4:30pm, EST, May 24, 2007.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Sole Source
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for an Extended Warranty Support on the Air and Missile Defense Operational Test Suite (AMDOTS) Remote Monitoring Units (RMU) from Protogate Inc., 12225 World Trade Drive, Suite R, San Diego, CA 92128.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because with over 25 years of legacy and specialty protocol experience, Protogate's employees have developed one of the industry's most unique and extensive protocol libraries. Over 100 legacy and specialty protocols are available for use on Freeway servers, including MILSTD 1200, MILSTAR, MILSTD 1300B, Asynchronous Wire Service (AWS), and a wide variety of military and radar protocols required by the AMDOTS Program.  A single Freeway can accommodate multiple protocols with a different protocol running on each communications board in the enclosure.  Additionally the Protogate Freeway Server is already an existing part of the AMDOTS program as 24 were deployed to the field in FY06. Protogate Inc. is the only company that is qualified to produce this item and their serial data cards and associated software are proprietary.  This software cannot be readily duplicated and/or maintained by any other vendor.  USSTRATCOM J65 has made efforts to research additional sources for similar items but none were available due to copyright laws.  No other source met all requirements. Protogate is the only responsible source with the necessary design, manufacturing, production, and process data capable of providing an extended warranty that meets the minimum requirements for form, fit, and function of the AMDOTS RMU. This corporate knowledge can only be provided by Protogate Inc. and cannot be acquired elsewhere.

To the best of our knowledge, Private Diagnostic Clinic is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821.

Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers for continued use in support of the Department's PKl program.The State Department PKl program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration. As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKIlBLADE configuration.IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 100MCreaders to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers. If there are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions may have the following issues:1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations 2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.Since Precise is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch, and replace defective readers with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Precise Biometrics is the sole source.<BR><BR>

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held. (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic  corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs. (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining  ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign  incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.           Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-9131), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

As used in this clause--Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts? (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter. (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ . (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status.

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<BR><BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received at that email address no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance for Big 1000 and 2400RCU.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features: •	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available.  •	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.   •	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.  •	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network.  •	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows.  •	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system.  •	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware.<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Due to CA’s investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Government’s best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance<BR><BR>
