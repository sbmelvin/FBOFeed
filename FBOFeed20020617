<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for one DIGITAL CONTROL FORCE LOADING SYSTEM to be a part of an Aft Flight Deck Simulator.  The system includes two dual axis (pitch and roll) sidearm electric control loader units, power supply units, and control loading computer.  An option will be included for the procurement of three additional systems.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) under FAR 13.5 (Test Program for Certain Commercial Items). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Sterling Dynamics Limited, who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. The control inceptors cannot use traditional hydraulics to provide force cues to the crew, thus requiring the design to use electric motors rather than hydraulic pumps.  Also, the sidearms and rudders must fit into a relatively small volume, limiting the size of electric motors, yet provide very high forces to the crew.  The design and manufacturing quality of the control inceptor is very critical to achieving the proper "feel" of the inceptor.  Stirling Dynamics is the only company that can provide all of these qualities (COTS, electric, high force, small volume, acceptable feel) in one system.  It would take another company substantial time and money to design and fabricate this highly specialized equipment and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 27, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Mashrab Saidmuradov, National Bank of Uzbekistan, 
c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Small and Medium Enterprise Project-Uzbekistan.
The National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide assistance on a Small and Medium Enterprise project in Uzbekistan.
The Government of Uzbekistan (GOU) has begun to place great importance on development of SMEs in the country, believing that they can be an engine of economic growth, as well as a force for political stability.  To that end, the GOU has negotiated SME credit facilities with the EBRD, ADB, and, most recently, with the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank).  The Ex-Im Bank program is $50 million, basically an Ex-Im Bank guarantee of a Bank of New York loan.  The NBU will on-lend the funds to Uzbek SMEs.

The GOU, through the NBU, has asked TDA for technical assistance (TA) in utilization of the Ex-Im credit in two ways.  First of all, the NBU would like to have a consultant assist Uzbek SMEs in preparing and/or refining business plans that will be presented to the NBU to access the Ex-Im funds.  Secondly, the NBU sees a need for someone to help in identifying potential U.S. suppliers to meet the needs that have been identified by the Uzbek SMEs.  Transactions under the Ex-Im facility will range $100,000 to $5 million, although the average size is likely to be at the lower end of the scale.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this TA will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $250,000 grant to NBU from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to NBU c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M. July 18, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  NBU reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  NBU also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  NBU is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with the University of Georgia/Center for International Trade & Security on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source.  It is anticipated that this requirement will be awarded for a base period of 12-months with two 12-month option periods. 

This requirement is being issued to provide program support for the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Industry Security/Nonproliferation and Export Control Cooperation (DOC/BIS/NEC).  The organization was established in 1994 within the Office of the Under Secretary of the Bureau of Industry and Security (then the Bureau of Export Administration) to support the United States Government (USG) international export control cooperation program directed at reducing the risks associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by strengthening cooperating countries' national export control system capabilities.  Based on its experience managing the U.S. domestic export control system for dual-use items, DOC/BIS supports the State Department funded program by developing and conducting technical exchanges in over two dozen targeted foreign countries that are designed to help them enhance or develop their national export control infrastructure capabilities.  The complexities involved in locating and engaging appropriate staff and other resources in this process represent a daunting and time-consuming process.  

The DOC/BIS/NEC requires assistance from an entity acknowledged by the U.S. international export control community as having expertise and a high level of competency in the field.

The purpose of this requirement is to provide support: (1) assessing the status of national export control system capabilities in order to identify deficiencies, and (2) measuring the effectiveness of the technical exchanges that have been conducted to remedy those deficiencies.  Such assessments enable the USG to identify priority countries on which to focus export control resources and support Commerce and State Department requirements to conduct overall evaluations of the effectiveness of the  USG's international program.  In this regard, BIS  requires support in defining, gathering, recording and analyzing factors in order to measure the effectiveness of programs under its management.

The NEC group requires specialized Contractor support in the following areas: the design of questionnaires to be used for assessing specific BIS activities; the development of a mutually agreed upon methodology and reporting format (drawing on existing and established methodologies) for evaluations of national export control systems; gathering data on selected individual national export control system capabilities; analyzing data and drafting national export control reports; publishing national export control reports using agreed upon methodology; developing,  jointly with BIS a methodology for evaluating multilateral events; issuing evaluation reports on BIS multilateral outreach events; compiling national assessments on an agreed upon regional methodology and format; and other activities. 

Offeror's who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response from acknowledged entities by the U.S. international export control community as having expertise and a high level of competency in the field.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 45-days after publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the address contained at the header or faxed to 301-713-0809 to the attention of Joel Perlroth, Contracting Officer.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for an electronic subscription service to IEEE-published and copyrighted documents.  The electronic library subscription service provides full-text, immediate access to IEEE and IEE copyrighted-documents using the Internet (Web-enabled) and a searchable interface to provide search capabilities of specific IEEE and IEE documents.  Distributors of IEEE and/or IEE  documents that provide delivery services of the documents (as opposed to immediate Internet access) do not satisfy this requirement. Additionally, distributors whose services do not provide complete, Internet access to all IEEE and IEE documents or provide only bibliographic information of IEEE and/or IEE documents do not satisfy the requirement. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)using FAR part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS (IEEE),who is the only responsible source and no other services will satsify the agency requirements. Only IEEE can provide access to all of IEEE's copyrighted documents. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become qualified to provide the Internet library services and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 26, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The first task is to demonstrate the proof-of-concept.  The second task is to demonstrate capability of the sensor to detect radar cross -section of the hidden targets in  a lead container.  Task three is to investigate the feasibility of detection of du and material with higher radiation potential in larger containers. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole sour ce contract to Bakhtar Associates, based on the above review and based upon independent contractor development.  No solicitation will be issued.  For information contact Thomas L. Cox, (703) 325-1196.

Introduction B.  Mission C.  Research Requirements Part II Proposal Evaluation Part III Proposal Preparation  ABSTRACT: The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB FL is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new airframe/ordnance and guidance/control technology weapon paradigms.  One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets.  Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches -lethal and non-lethal - to defeat these targets.  For example, dropping a 2000-pound bomb on a biological weapons factory represents a standard lethal approach to defeat the target.  Alternatively, an approach may be to detonate an acoustic energy warhead that neutralizes the biological agent within the facility.  This represents an innovative, non-lethal approach to the problem.  These are the types of concepts being sought, i.e., approaches and methodologies that are so innovative that they essentially represent new ordnance package and delivery system technology paradigms.  With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary incrementalism, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.  The military payoff would be in terms of significant munition weight and size reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness.  Non-lethal approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced loss of life.  Another goal of this program is to develop highly innovative concepts and approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions.  This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) of munition airframes will also be sought.  Munitions airframes under consideration include air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface munitions (general purpose bombs and hard target penetrators), exointerceptors, submunitions, and projectiles.  The basic seeker technologies to be considered include:  sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms.  The basic GN&C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms.  In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be developed. Novel concepts such as ultra-light integration of GN&C, seeker, and warhead technologies will be considered.  Ideas and concepts such as smart skin (for sensing and controlling the ambient aerodynamic environment) and microelectromechanical systems (e.g., micro gyros and accelerometers) will be explored.  This radical type of technology has the potential to increase weapon performance by orders of magnitude over existing systems.  The technology developed under this program will support the far term goals of the Anti-Materiel Munition, Small Smart Bomb, Hard Target Smart Munition, Hard Target Functional Defeat, Persistent Area Denial, Air Expeditionary Force, Counter-Proliferation, Air Superiority Missile Technology, and Revolutionary Munition Integrating Concepts.  New integrating concepts evolving from the aforementioned ones center on munition technologies for close air support, urban combat, air expeditionary forces, counter-proliferation, and functional defeat of hardened targets.  The Munitions Directorate welcomes innovative research proposals in many different areas.  Some specific examples are given below:  (Please note that this list is not intended to be restrictive.  Proposals dealing with other areas of revolutionary munition ordnance or guidance technology will also be welcome.)  - Target Location Methods  - Multi-Mode Explosives  ?Integrated Guidance  - Munition Speed/Maneuverability  - Stand Off Distance Enhancement Munition Component Parts Reduction (Numbers/Size) Networked Communication/Intelligence Munition Knowledge (Artificial Intelligence) Multifunctional Damage Mechanisms Non-Lethal Technologies Battle Damage Indication Munition Related Environmental Pollution Prevention Also, beginning with this Broad Agency Announcement, the Munitions Directorate wishes to emphasize four specific technology topics.  Proposals describing innovative technologies that may have the potential to support one or more of these topics are particularly encouraged. 1.  Positron Energy Conversion  2. Micro Platforms  3. Cooperative Attack 4.Subterranean Platforms Proposals should describe scientific study and experimentation to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas or other areas that may have the potential to provide paradigm-shifting technologies that could dramatically change the way the Air Force conducts future operations. This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts: PART I  Research Interests PART II Proposal Evaluation PART III Proposal Preparation  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals.  PART I  RESEARCH INTERESTS  A.  INTRODUCTION  This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.  AFRL/MN contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology.  This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interests to this Directorate.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MN should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/MN scientist identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MN may have in a specific research project.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during the period this BAA is open.  However, prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are required to submit a two to three page white paper on their proposed research topic, identifying the key AFRL/MN staff members who have been identified and contacted for each area of interest.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms. Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  This white paper should be submitted on organization letterhead.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA might be invited to submit a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received. A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate.  We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.  Note that changes in funding availability and/or Government discretion may result in no award under this BAA.  Our goal is to award ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU?s), and thirty percent (30%) to small businesses, which includes ten percent (10%) to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB?s) and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), over the life of the BAA.  For the purpose of this BAA the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received that are acceptable regardless of source. In addition to the general technical and contracting goals mentioned in this BAA, there are two additional items of special emphasis: a. AFRL/MN plans to seek out and award ideas and proposals that have potential for creating new airframe/ordnance and guidance/control paradigms.  We are seeking ideas that would have the potential to change current military tactics.  We strongly encourage "thinking out of the box" and beyond the scope of present commercialization.  An example of what we are looking for is:  It usually takes 5 bolts to put a widget together.  If you use 2 bolts to put it together, you are innovative; but if you put it together using no bolts, then you are revolutionary -you are using a new dimension in technology. b.Many of the areas of technology under investigation have commercial potential, the exploitation of which could lead to improved military performance in terms of:  significant increases in the affordability of military systems; the elimination of health, safety, and environmental hazards in manufacturing processes; the availability of commercial off-the-shelf items for use in military systems; or application of critical technologies from the federal laboratories, universities, or non-profit institutions.  The Munitions Directorate encourages the submittal of cost shared proposals in support of dual use applications. This BAA will remain open until superceded.  It will be reissued periodically and may be amended at any time. The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader will note some overlap between sections.  To contact an AFRL/MN staff member by mail, include branch or division symbol and write:  Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate 101 West Eglin Boulevard  Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810 B. MISSION  The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development.  The Munitions Directorate plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munition System Program Offices.  There are three divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development.  They are the Assessment and Demonstrations Division, the Ordnance Division, and the Advanced Guidance Division.  ASSESSMENT AND DEMONSTRATIONS DIVISION (MNA) The Assessment and Demonstrations Division is responsible for assessment of lethality, effectiveness, and utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation.  The division directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes (including innovative flight controls and range extension devices), submunition dispensing, and weapon carriage and release concepts.  The division also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. The division consists of the Computational Mechanics Branch (MNAC), the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (MNAL), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (MNAV). ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (MNG) The Advanced Guidance Division conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in guidance and control technology to support development of autonomous, precision-guided munitions. The relevant technologies are in two general areas: seekers and conventional guidance and control.  The seeker technologies include electro-optical, infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons, exointerceptors, and submunition guidance.  This includes signal/image processing algorithms and processors.  Conventional guidance and control includes inertial sensors, GPS receivers, antijam GPS technologies, and relevant information processing including guidance laws, state vector estimators, and autopilots.  The division performs laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts and conventional guidance and control concepts.  The division also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop closed loop guidance evaluation facility, an image processing laboratory, a radio-frequency measurement laboratory, a laser radar facility, an advanced navigation laboratory, and an electro-optics laboratory.  The division consists of the Seeker Image and Signal Processing Branch (MNGI), the Guidance Simulation Branch (MNGG), the Navigation and Control Branch (MNGN), and the Seeker Branch (MNGS). ORDNANCE DIVISION (MNM) The Ordnance Division directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development of fuzes, warheads, bombs, submunitions, and explosives.  Air launched munitions should consider fighter, bomber, and UAV aircraft as the launch platforms.  MNM operates high explosives R&D facilities that support munitions programs.  Further interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e., explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets.  Interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to research and development of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena.  MNM also provides technical evaluation and consulting services to other government agencies and industries concerned with munitions technology.  MNM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (MNME), the Fuzes Branch (MNMF), the Ordnance Integration Branch (MNMI), and the Damage Mechanisms Branch (MNMW). C.	PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREAS  The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the twelve prospective research areas mentioned in the ABSTRACT.  These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munition paradigms.  Further, these twelve topics are not intended as an all-inclusive list.  There are many other areas that may provide a fertile field for revolutionizing future Air Force weapons.  However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.  Proposals requiring yet-to-be be discovered/developed technologies are discouraged. TARGET LOCATION METHODS The goal of this work is to develop a means to allow the user to be able to precisely find and identify any target, no matter how well it is obscured, buried, camouflaged, or hidden.  This may require more than one sensing technology.  This technology may be integrated into discrete munitions, or it may be incorporated within other platforms.  The purpose of this research is to make a future battle space more transparent to air delivered munitions so that targets will be easier to locate. Mr. David Gray AFRL/MNGI (850) 882-3910, ext. 2373 gray@eglin.af.mil  MULTI MODE EXPLOSIVES The goal of this work is to develop warheads that are more flexible with regard to the targets they can destroy.  One of the main constituents of a warhead is the explosive.  Explosives may vary with energy release per unit weight and with ignition sensitivity.  Ideally, an explosive should remain insensitive to ignition until it is properly fuzed.  After ignition it should be able to provide the equivalent energy of other more sensitive (volatile), high-energy explosives.  The purpose of this research is to develop an explosive that has high energetics along with characteristics that prevent inadvertent ignition.  Binary explosives that, when separated, can be stored as non-explosives are also of interest.  Flexible or innovative use of energy stored within the warhead  (DC voltage or high explosive) is also of interest. Further, a propulsion unit that may double as a general-purpose warhead is also of interest. Dr. Alex Cash AFRL/MNMI (850) 882-0391 cash@eglin.af.mil   INTEGRATED GUIDANCE It is MN?s belief that the traditional "stove pipe" approaches of the past will not facilitate the leap forward in technology required in future conflicts.  Intelligent weapon systems need to become highly integrated, both at the component and system level, to afford the capability and autonomy required of future tactical weapons.  We define integration here as the interaction and interconnection of functions or components in a system, whereby the effectiveness of the system is enhanced by the combining, complementing, and sharing of the various functions of the system.  It is the overarching goal of this research to develop new and novel ways to enhance weapon system effectiveness through higher levels of guidance, navigation, control, and estimation integration, from the sub-system component level all the way up to the operation level.  One example of this is the loosely coupled, tightly coupled, ultra-tightly coupled evolution of GPS/INS systems for tactical weapon navigation. Dr. Rob Murphey AFRL/MNGN (850) 882-2961, ext. 3453 murphey@eglin.af.mil MUNITION SPEED/MANEUVERABILITY The goal of this work is to develop means or methods to efficiently impart increased velocity and maneuverability to air delivered munitions.  This capability can manifest itself as translational speed or as an enhanced ability to change direction.  Many traditional approaches such as integrated jets or rocket motors have drawbacks, not the least of which are added cost and weight.  There may be innovative ways to construct the jets and rocket motors so they are less expensive and lighter in weight.  Or, there may be other methods to increase munition speed.  Innovative ways to increase maneuverability other than conventional fins or reaction jets may also exist.  Methods may be developed which increase a munition?s velocity somewhat less than that associated with a rocket or jet motor.  But these methods may cost far less than those motors and thereby be practical for greater employment.  The purpose of this study is to develop an inexpensive, lightweight means to impart greater velocity to direct attack munitions.

<DESC>NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY The Navigation and Control Branch (MNGN) is interested in developing inertial sensor components, GPS anti-jam and antenna technology, and advanced guidance and control techniques. Inertial sensor technology should be focused on developing technologies with the goal of achieving at least tactical grade performance with the potential for significantly reduced costs and size (less than $2K and 15 cubic inches per inertial measurement unit respectively). Inertial sensor technologies of interest include micromachined and optical. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Advanced guidance and control technologies of interest include: guidance law and autopilot designs that minimize redesign with each new weapon application, methodologies capable of identifying and tracking dynamic changes in the attitude of air-to-air targets, and integrated weapon guidance. Integrated weapon guidance includes guidance-autopilot integration, guidance-seeker-fuze-warhead integration, guidance-seeker integration, and total system integration to include hardware sensor integration.

Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models.  Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, fragmentation, localized shear band formation, and high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, hydrodynamic ram, atomization, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales and advanced numerical methods.  Innovative theoretical, computational and experimental projects that specifically address the problems of interest and result in improved predictive capability are the goal.   Dr. Lawrence E.

Interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e. explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets.  Interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to research and development of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena. For Focused energy Warhead interests call:  Dr. David Lambert AFRL/MNMW 850 882-7991 Fax:  850-883-1381 e-mail david.lambert@eglin.af.mil    For Unitary Warheads interests call: Dr. Mary Hughes  AFRL/MNMW 850-882-7998 Fax:  850-883-1381  e-mail mary.Hughes@eglin.af.mil  FUZE RESEARCH The goal of this work is to perform research in the areas of:  shock hardened sub-munition fuzing and second safety environment for gravity released general purpose bombs.  The shock hardened sub-munition fuzing should be capable of time delay functions or advanced post impact environmental sensing.  The second safety environment for gravity released general purpose bombs.  The shock hardened sub-munition fuzing should be capable of time delay functions or advanced post impact environment sensing.  The second safety environment for gravity released general purpose bombs should replace the wind turbine fuze auxiliary unit (FZU-XX) providing a credible second environment after release of the munition.  The research should incorporate state of the art technology and innovative methods to improve performance.  Mr. Tim Tobik  AFRL/MNMF 850-882-2005 ext 2005  ADVANCED ENERGETICS 
The Energetics Materials Branch (AFRL/MNME) is interested in energetics research proposals.  This topic includes development of more energetic materials and/or combinations of materials including nanometric explosives as well as other high energy density materials.  Also included are reactive materials comprising metastable interstitial composites (MICs) and/or metal fuels in combination with oxidizers and explosives.  Constitutive modeling of these materials, including mesoscale descriptions of their dynamic mechanical response, initiation mechanisms and reactive equations of state are included as well.  Novel approaches for formulating, processing, enhancing the mechanical properties (i.e., strength, toughness) and characterizing the special features of reactive materials and functionally graded materials in terms of their performance and energy release benefits are also of interest. Mr. Danny Hayles  AFRL/MNME 850-882-4212 ext 106 e-mail danny.hayles@eglin.af.mil  PART II  PROPOSAL EVALUATION  A.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below. The factors are listed in descending order of importance. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. 1.  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MN mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this directorate?s overall research program.  2.  The offeror's capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives. 3.  The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives. 4.  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds. B.  Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MN technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered to have sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review. C.  It is the policy of AFRL/MN to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified scientists from within the Government. The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal.  D.  Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MN program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area. PART III  PROPOSAL PREPARATION  Each proposal submitted should consist of two volumes. Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal and Volume 2 should address the price/cost portions of the proposal. Volume 1 should be limited to a total of 50 pages, including resumes, charts, figures, tables, etc. Pages in excess of the specified 50 pages will be removed and returned to the offeror before evaluation starts. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper with information on it. Minimum print size is 10 point type, or 12 pitch.  Every proposal shall have at least one copy submitted on disk or via e-mail with a hard copy of the signature page sent via regular mail.  Proposals submitted on disk or sent via e-mail are to be submitted on Microsoft Office 97 format. Note: The preferred format for all proposals is via electronic means, whether on disc or via e-mail. The Government intends to work proposals and awards through electronic means.

The cost proposal should follow items one (1) through thirteen (13), above, as applicable for assistance instruments.  E.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, in lieu of a contract, will be considered and will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.  F.  The use of oral technical presentations is highly encouraged. Specific guidelines need to be followed for the use of oral technical presentations. For information regarding the use of oral technical presentations contact Brenda Soler at 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, 850-882-4294, ext.3206.  G.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. H.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. I.  The general scope for a program resulting from this BAA is a limited research program, generally a feasibility study. The program should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort.  Any significant testing is unlikely; however there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA.  The suggested guideline on price is up to approximately $300,000, but there is limited potential for larger awards depending upon the availability of funds, the scope of the work and the potential for a cost sharing contract or assistance instrument.  Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs will be considered under this BAA. J.  Refer to the "Proprietary Information" and "When and How to Submit" sections of Air Force Material Command Unsolicited Proposal Guide, AFMC Pamphlet 64-101. The AFMC Form 190 is not applicable to BAAs. The guide is available at the following AFMC Publications site:  http://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/pdl/afmc/.  K.  Responders should reference the above number (MNK BAA-02-0002) and a technical topic and contact name. Proposals should be sent to Ms. Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL. 32542-6810. This announcement is open and effective until superceded.  Proposers are warned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to obligate the government. L.  A National Agency Check will be required if it necessary for a Contractor to use Government computers.  M.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager identified above.  For any other concerns, interested parties may E-Mail AFRL/MN's Ombudsman, Lt Col Mary T. Quinn, quinnm@eglin.af.mil

<DESC>STAND OFF DISTANCE ENHANCEMENT The goal of this work is to develop methods and means to increase the combat radius of a munition after it has been released from the parent aircraft.  Traditionally, this has been accomplished by the incorporation of some type of rocket or jet motor.  Alternately, the integration of some high lift/low drag wing has also been used.  Both methods have disadvantages.  The rocket and jet motor are expensive and add significant weight to the munition.  Conventional, fold out wings may also be expensive and cumbersome. In addition, time to target increases linearly with standoff making mobile targets more difficult to engage.  Innovative advances in jet or rocket motor technology could make them lighter in weight and less expensive.  There may be ways to generate airframe lift by novel means that are less bulky and less expensive than current methods.  Reducing drag of the vehicle could also affect range.   The purpose of this study is to develop innovative methods to efficiently and inexpensively increase munition stand off distance. Dr. Mike Valentino AFRL/MNAV (850) 882-2220, ext. 3331 valentin@eglin.af.mil MUNITION COMPONENT PART REDUCTION (NUMBERS/SIZE) The goal of this work is to develop manufacturing technologies, design technologies, materials, assembly methods, assemblies, or subassemblies which individually or combined, reduce the number of component parts that comprise an existing or possible future munition.  The assumption is made that fewer parts translates into a finished product that may be less expensive to build, lighter in weight, more resistant to malfunction, and easier or quicker to maintain or repair.  Also, a parallel goal of this work is to reduce the size of the munition's component parts.  This contribution to overall size reduction would have inestimable value in both aircraft combat loadout and with regard to logistics.  The purpose of this effort is to develop innovative methods to reduce a munition's component parts (both in numbers and size) while lowering its production cost and increasing its mission?ready rate and combat effectiveness. Mr. Charles Cottrell AFRL/MNAV (850) 882-2220, ext. 3472 cottrell@eglin.af.mil   NETWORKED COMMUNICATION/INTELLIGENCE The goal of this work is to develop an efficient, secure means to share real time data among individual munitions, parent aircraft, surveillance assets (airborne or space borne), and command facilities (airborne or ground based).  This information may include such things as suspected target location, threat location, friendly force location, asset assignment, and possibly post strike battle damage assessment.  The purpose of this information networking is to more efficiently coordinate scarce combat resources to successfully conduct a military campaign. Dr. Rob Murphey AFRL/MNGN (850) 882-2961, ext. 3453 murphey@eglin.af.mil MUNITION KNOWLEDGE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) The goal of this work is to develop an artificial intelligence based "knowledge" that may be applicable to munitions including submunitions.  This artificial intelligence may be applicable to self-diagnostic maintenance, to optimal target selection, to a mid-strike analysis by remaining submunitions, real-time for path planning, or any other method which could enhance individual weapon or coordinated sortie effectiveness.  A munition that could modify its attack profile just prior to target engagement in order to optimize its impact effectiveness would represent an important advance.  A munition which could adapt its ingress path to the target to increase the number of targets and the probabilities of these detections and classifications, while simultaneously avoiding threats and jamming would also represent an important advance.  The purpose of this study is to develop a munition based artificial intelligence capability, which would enhance dependability and efficiency. Mr. David Gray AFRL/MNGI (850) 882-3910, ext. 2373 gray@eglin.af.mil   MULTIFUNCTIONAL DAMAGE MECHANISMS The goal of this work is to develop damage mechanisms that destroy or seriously degrade a target without resorting solely to blast, fragments, or high-speed projectile impact.  Advances in several scientific fields may offer suitable avenues for development.  The combining of one or more unconventional damage mechanisms along with conventional blast, fragmentation, and/or projectile impact mechanisms may prove to be appropriate for optimizing a future munition's effectiveness.  The purpose of this study is to develop unconventional damage mechanisms, which may be used independently or in concert with existing mechanisms to enhance munition effectiveness.    Dr. Alex Cash AFRL/MNMI (850) 882-0391 cash@eglin.af.mil  NON-LETHAL TECHNOLOGIES The goal of this work is to develop non-lethal technologies that are compatible or potentially compatible with existing or future air delivered munitions and are likely to be effective in situations where deadly force is not the best solution.  These non-lethal technologies can be used for facility denial purposes and/or for degrading the combat effectiveness of enemy vehicles and dismounted personnel.  Particular emphasis shall be placed on two areas: hard and deeply buried facility denial and usefulness in an urban environment against hidden or barricaded combatants.  It is understood that future air delivered weapons which employ non-lethal munitions may have to be deployed from unconventional platforms such as cargo planes and helicopters, though deployment from existing attack aircraft is preferred.  The purpose of this study is to develop a capability in this area for the Air Force. Mr. Charles Cottrell  AFRL/MNAV (850) 882-2220, ext. 3472 cottrell@eglin.af.mil   BATTLE DAMAGE INDICATION The goal of this work is to develop low cost, innovative methods to quickly determine the affect an air-delivered munition has had on its intended target.  This is especially important with regard to deeply buried targets where post-attack visual cues may be difficult to perceive.  An onboard munition data link may be appropriate for obtaining an indication of damage to this type of target.  Such a data link might be dependent on a trailing wire, or it might be completely wireless.  Conversely, the battle damage indicator might be totally independent of the penetrating munition.  The purpose of this study is to develop a low cost, efficient, and reliable means to quickly provide the warfighter an accurate determination, or at least a reliable estimate, of the damage inflicted on a target - particularly a hardened and/or deeply buried one. Dr. Alex Cash AFRL/MNMI (850) 882-0391 cash@eglin.af.mil  ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION PREVENTION One of the goals of the Munitions Directorate is to develop "Green Munitions" concepts.  These concepts would result in weapons that would not cause pervasive adverse environmental effects and would use environmentally friendly manufacturing materials and techniques.  The objective of this work is to develop processes, materials, recycling, or disposal methods that would minimize the amount and hazardous nature of pollutants in munitions concepts.  Concepts could span a wide range of topics from the development of composites with non-hazardous constituents, devices to detect underground unexploded ordnance, to recycling materials such as coolants and metal alloys.  Revolutionary proposals, for example, would be those that reduced the need for hazardous materials, recycled hazardous by-products, or reduced operational costs by using recyclable components.  Dr. Alex Cash AFRL/MNMI (850) 882-0391 cash@eglin.af.mil
D. TECHNOLOGY TOPICS The Directorate wishes to emphasize innovative research that may support the following four topics. These topics are of particular interest in that several synergistic revolutionary guidance and ordnance technologies may be combined to lend support.  Perhaps two or more of the twelve prospective research areas listed above could be combined in some fashion. 1. POSITRON ENERGY CONVERSION  The modern Air Force runs on energy.  The service has been using various forms of chemical energy to accomplish its objectives for the 50 plus years of its existence.  Recent advances in physics are opening the door to a new realm of energy usage based on the famous E = mc2 relationship.  Mass conversion to energy provides the densest source of energy known.  Exploration of the possibilities of applying this source of energy storage to solving the Air Forces' problems is important and primary to accomplishing future goals.  Whether in the form of antimatter research (positron production, containment and conversion) or in the area of advanced energetics, new, innovative, and efficient sources of energy are a must for future war fighting.   Mr. Ken Edwards AFRL/MNAV (850) 882-8876, ext. 3387 kenneth.edwards@eglin.af.mil 2. MICRO PLATFORMS The goal of this work is to develop technologies to support a "micro-bot" system that can, depending on its payload and operational requirements, act as means of attacking, tagging, tracking, and/or observing enemy operations.  The technology developments required to realize the micro-platform concept include advancements in sensors, micro-fabrication, micro-power, munitions, and communications.  The goal is to develop a micro-scaled device capable of satisfying three basic functional requirements regardless of operational function: (1) mobility ? the ability to move about autonomously or in coordination, (2) navigation - the ability to determine the appropriate direction of motion, and (3) payload delivery - the ability to autonomously, or in coordination, deliver its payload dependent upon its mission.  The purpose of this effort is to develop a micro-scaled platform capable of efficiently acting as a means of observing, tracking, tagging, and/or attacking mission targets.    Ms Carrie Fowler AFRL/MNAV (850) 882-8876, ext. 3383   carrie.fowler@eglin.af.mil  3. COOPERATIVE ATTACK The goal of this work is to develop a means whereby discrete weapons or submunitions can coordinate their attack.  The Directorate expects that many future weapons will be equipped with autonomous target acquisition (ATA) algorithms.  However, even with ATA, each munition selects a target based solely upon its own information.  The result is that many targets are completely missed, while more munitions than necessary to achieve a kill attack the highly visible targets.  The major objective of this research is to develop the technologies that will enable a group of autonomous munitions to communicate, cooperate, and adapt to battlefield dynamics such that the search and attack strategies are optimal. Dr. Rob Murphey  AFRL/MNGN (850) 882-2961, ext. 3453 murphey@eglin.af.mil   SUBTERRANEAN PLATFORMS   The Air Force is increasingly interested in servicing targets that are located underground and are often deeply buried.  Traditionally, these targets have been attacked with large, heavy-cased gravity bombs.  However, future weapon systems may be somewhat smaller in size and may be able to intelligently maneuver from the surface to a specific underground location.  A few of the issues that must be addressed include the means of underground navigation, the method of locomotion, the locomotive energy source, and the types of onboard payloads. Further, subterranean platforms may possibly be used as a means to accurately and surreptitiously place sensors that may monitor a given location. Mr. Fred Davis ARRL/MNA (850) 882-4401, ext. 3212  frederick.davis@eglin.af.mil PART II  PROPOSAL EVALUATION  A.Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below. The factors are listed in descending order of importance. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.  1.  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MN mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this directorate's overall research program. 2.  The offeror's capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives. 3.  The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives. 4.  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds. B.	Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MN technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review. C. It is the policy of AFRL/MN to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified scientists from within the Government. The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal. D. Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MN program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area. PART III  PROPOSAL PREPARATION A.	Each proposal submitted should consist of two volumes. Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal and Volume 2 should address the price/cost portions of the proposal. Volume 1 should be limited to a total of 50 pages, including resumes, charts, figures, tables, etc. Pages in excess of the specified 50 pages will be removed and returned to the offeror before evaluation starts. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it. Minimum print size is 10-point type, or 12 pitch.  Every proposal shall have at least one copy submitted on disk or via e-mail with a hard copy of the signature page sent via regular mail.  Proposals submitted on disk or sent via e-mail are to be submitted on Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Word 2000 format. Note: The preferred format for all proposals is via electronic means, whether on disc or e-mail. The Government intends to work proposals and awards through electronic means.  To do business with the Air Force Research Laboratory/Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN), you must have software packages that are compatible with Microsoft Office 97. B. The technical portion of the proposal, Volume 1, should contain the following: 1.  A title and abstract that includes a concise Statement of Work and basic approaches to be utilized. The Statement of Work should indicate the effort intended for each period of research. 2.  A reasonably complete discussion stating the background and objectives of the proposed work, the approaches to be considered, and the resources to be employed. Include also the nature and extent of the anticipated results, and if known, the manner in which the work will contribute to the accomplishment of the agency's mission. 3.  The names, brief biographical information, and a list of recent publications of the offeror's key personnel who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience of the proposer in the field is especially important.  4.  The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the Munitions Directorate, e.g. facilities, equipment, and materials. 5.  The names of federal, state, local agencies or other parties receiving the proposals and/or funding the proposed effort of a similar nature. If none, so state. 6.  The identity of facilities, specialized equipment, or other real property to be used for the work, if appropriate for an understanding of the technical work to be conducted. 7.  Identify all on-going Government contracts and related past contracts or assistance instruments. Provide a technical point of contact and telephone number for each contract cited. C. The cost portion of the proposal, Volume 2, should contain the following: 1.  Proposal Pricing Cover Sheet for total proposal. 2.  Summary by cost element and profit for each contract line and sub-line item and for the total proposal. 3.  Labor summary for total proposal by categories, rates, and hours. Include an explanation of how labor rates are computed, including base rates and escalation. Show that are level of effort, if applicable. For proposals from universities, the times and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. 4.  Identification of indirect rates by fiscal year and explanation of how established and base to which they apply. 5.  Bill of materials detailing items by type, quantity, and unit price, total amount, and source of estimate. Provide vendor quotes. 6.  Summary of all travels by destination, purpose, number of people and days, air fare, per diem, car rental, etc. 7.  Consultants by name, rate, and number of days or hours. Furnish copy of consulting agreement, and identify prior agreements under which the consultant received the proposed rate. 8.  Other direct costs by type, amount, cost per unit and purpose. Specifically identify any costs for printing and publication and computers. 9.  Subcontractor's proposal with prime offeror's price/cost analysis of subcontractor?s proposal. If subcontractor was not competed, include justification. 10.  Forecast of monthly dollar commitments for the proposed contract period. 11.  Type of contract or assistance instrument proposed. (We expect most awards to universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.) 12.  State whether you are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, nonprofit, educational, or historically black college or university. 13.  Other terms and conditions, if any. D. Grants, cooperative agreements, and other transactions are encouraged. Information regarding these can be found in the AFMC Homepage - site: http://www.afmc.wpafb.af.mil/organizations/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkt/jump.htm. The cost proposal should follow items one (1) through thirteen (13), above, as applicable for assistance instruments. E. Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, in lieu of a contract, will be considered and will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. F. The use of oral technical presentations is highly encouraged. Specific guidelines need to be followed for the use of oral technical presentations. For information regarding the use of oral technical presentations contact Brenda Soler at 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, 850-882-4294, ext.3206. G.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. H. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract, or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  I. The general scope for a program resulting from this BAA is a limited research program, generally a feasibility Study. The program should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA.  The suggested guideline on price is up to approximately $300,000, but there is limited potential for larger awards depending upon the availability of funds, the scope of the work and the potential for a cost sharing contract or assistance instrument. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs will be considered under this BAA.  J.  Refer to the "Proprietary Information" and "When and How to Submit" sections of Air Force Material Command Unsolicited Proposal Guide, AFMC Pamphlet 64-101. The AFMC Form 190 is not applicable to BAAs. The guide is available at the following AFMC publications site:  http://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/pdl/afmc/.  K. Responders should reference the above number (MNK-BAA-02-0003) and a technical topic and contact name. Proposals should be sent to Ms. Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL. 32542-6810. This announcement is open and effective until super-ceded. Those who propose are warned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to obligate the government.      L.  A National Agency Check will be required if it necessary for a Contractor to use Government computers.          M. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposal or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager identified above.  For any other concerns, interested parties may call AFRL/MN's Ombudsman, Lt Col Mary T. Quinn, (850) 882-2872 ext 3420.

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisy agency requirements." Boeing is the sole developer and integrator of the AMC&D; no other supplier has the knowledge, capability, or technical expertise to perform the tasks associated with this IDIQ procurement. Scope of work encompasses the continued analysis, design, development, integration and test of the AMC&D system developed under the existing sole source contract (N00019-00-C-0307) with McDonnell Douglas/Boeing. The IDIQ contract will support requirements that fall under the general scope of AMC&D development but are not covered under the contract CLINs for Engineering Manufacture and Development (EMD) or Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). It is anticipated that a one year plus two option years contract with T&M task orders will result from this procurement. A maximum level of effort is estimated at 365,500 hours. Award of the proposed contract is anticipated to be made on or before February 2003. This is an announcement only regarding a sole source acquisition; there is no solicitation available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Applanix Corporation, of Ontario, Canada, for acquisition of one (1) Position and Orientation System for Land Vehicles Applications, to be used in the Intelligent Systems Division (ISD), at NIST.*****Installation and training at the NIST laboratory shall be included.*****In addition, a one-year hardware warranty, on parts and labor, shall be included.  Repairs shall be made at vendor's facility.  Vendor shall provide an equivalent POS LV system on a no-charge, loan basis, while repairs are being made.*****Sole source determination is based on the Division's need for 100% compatibility between the System being purchased and the Applanix Corporation Position and Orientation System already in use in the Division.  The new system will serve both as the position and orientation measurement system for a Mobility Program test vehicle, and as a set of backup hardware for the Applanix POS LV that is currently installed on another Mobility Program test vehicle.  Such readily available spare components are required because of the high profile demonstrations in which the vehicles take part.  Applanix is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's needs, as it is the only vendor able to provide, within the required timeframe, a commercial system that will be completely plug compatible (electrically, mechanically, and functionally) with the existing system so that each major component may serve as a spare for the equivalent component in the other system.*****Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by July 1, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
USAID/CAR CIVIC ADVOCACY SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR UZBEKISTAN


I.  PREAMBLE

Over the past several months, USAID/Central Asia Republics (USAID/CAR) has witnessed what appears to be a greater openness on the part of Uzbekistan authorities to citizen input in decision-making processes.  Coupled with the success of USAID/CAR efforts to promote civic advocacy at the local level, the Mission is cautiously optimistic that these developments warrant the initiation of a civic advocacy support program at the national level in Uzbekistan. 

USAID/CAR is requesting applications for new civic advocacy support activities at the national level in Uzbekistan. Since civic advocacy at the national level is new territory for USAID/CAR assistance, as well as for most non-governmental, non-commercial organizations (NNOs) in Uzbekistan, recipients are invited to design both an assessment of opportunities for civic advocacy at the national level and an assistance program that supports such civic advocacy.  One winner will be chosen to implement both the assessment and assistance program.  Funding will be provided first for the assessment.  Based on the results of the assessment and the submission of a detailed annual workplan, incremental funding may be provided for the assistance program by the end of the Fiscal Year 2002.  USAID anticipates one approximately two-year award (cooperative agreement) resulting from this RFA.


II.  BACKGROUND

Uzbekistan is the most populous of the Central Asian republics and is situated in the geographic heart of the region, bordered by the four other Central Asian countries, as well as Afghanistan. After September 11, Uzbekistan suddenly found itself on the frontline of the war against terror with increased strategic importance to the stability of Central Asia. With its central location, fast growing population, a variety of natural resources, and a potential for a diversified economy, an open, prosperous Uzbekistan is central to economic growth in the region. However, its leadership remains entrenched in a closed and stagnant political and economic system. Part of the USAID strategy in Uzbekistan, thus, is to help build constituencies for political, economic and social change.

The unwillingness of the Government of Uzbekistan (GOU) to introduce market-oriented reforms in the financial sector continues to constrain economic development. The GDP per capita income is $488, with 10% official unemployment and rising inflation. According to some estimates, one-third of annual profits from small private enterprises is channeled as protection and bribes. Citizens remain poorly informed, and their participation in economic and political life is restricted, particularly at the national level. Political opposition is not tolerated, and interference with the independent media persists. Despite public statements from the highest level of the GOU promising legal and judicial reform and protection of the independent media, there is little tangible achievement. Nevertheless, progress does continue in building a vocal and effective NGO community, particularly at local levels.

Significant judicial reforms were instituted in 2001, stemming from USAID assistance to Uzbekistan?s judges? association. Reforms included the adoption of a new law on the Procuracy and the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers removed two of the largest obstacles to judicial independence, namely the prosecutorial right to suspend judicial judgements and the authority of the Ministry of Justice to appoint and remove judges. 

Over the past several years, the GOU has become more open to including NGOs in policy dialogue discussions. Three or four years ago, the GOU treated NGOs with suspicion and saw them as 'anti-governmental' rather than grappling with the nuances and importance of 'non-governmental' organizations as part of civil society.  In March 1999, the Oliy Majlis, the parliament of Uzbekistan, passed a law on Non-Government, Non-Commercial Organizations, commonly referred to as the NNO law. This significantly eased the registration process for civic groups and raised their visibility level in Uzbekistan.  Thick layers of bureaucracy hamper the NNO registration process, but in general most groups are eventually registered.

The vast majority of NNOs in Uzbekistan are vehicles for social service provision. Very few maintain agile advocacy skills; however, an increasing number of NNOs lobby local authorities on key issues. Local administrations are in turn more cooperative and open to suggestions from local organizations. In a few instances, city authorities requested civic groups to carry out assessment on certain social condition in the region, realizing that NNOs are often better equipped with assessment tools than government authorities. 

USAID supports advocacy, sustainability and mobilization efforts for civil society groups in Uzbekistan through a wide range of projects. Counterpart Consortium, for instance, works with community groups and NNOs through its network of seven civil society support centers in the country. The centers provide training to NNOs to improve their advocacy skills and financial sustainability. The American Bar Association/ Central and East European Law Initiative (ABA/CEELI) works with a wide range of legal advocacy groups including a student bar association, an association of judges and an Association of Advocates to improve advocacy on legal reform issues and judicial independence. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) carries out a program promoting NNO dialogue with government institutions regarding the development and implementation of NNO legislation. Through the ICNL program, civic groups are provided an opportunity to participate in advocacy at the national level. This opening represents a window of opportunity for a civic advocacy activity.


III.  OBJECTIVE

Work performed under this award will contribute to the achievement of Strategic Objective 2.1, Strengthened Democratic Culture Among Citizens and Targeted Institutions, as outlined in the USAID Assistance Strategy for Central Asia 2001-2005.   The primary objective of this Agreement is to strengthen democratic culture in Uzbekistan by assisting non-governmental, non-commercial organizations in their efforts to carry out civic advocacy campaigns at the national level.  Secondarily, this activity will serve to engage citizens in the democratic process by involving them in such campaigns.


IV.  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

USAID/CAR envisions an activity consisting of two main parts: (1) an assessment to determine opportunities for civic advocacy at the national level, including the identification of potential non-governmental, non-commercial organization (NNO) partner(s) and campaign issues, and (2) the development of national advocacy campaigns, including the provision of technical assistance, training, and financial support to NNO partner(s) in order to assist them with implementing such advocacy campaigns.

Though the advocacy efforts should be focused at the national level, namely ministries, parliament, and/or other government entities, NNO partners need not be restricted to those based in Tashkent.  For instance, the recipient could partner with an NNO or network of NNOs to conduct an advocacy campaign on issues specifically related to a particular region but that would be conducted at the national level.  

USAID/CAR expects 1-2 expatriates to work under this program. In combination, the one or two expatriates proposed must demonstrate considerable experience in civic advocacy and knowledge of the Central Asia region.  No later than 30 days prior to the expiration date of the Cooperative Agreement, USAID/CAR will determine the feasibility and usefulness of continued civic advocacy beyond the end date of the Cooperative Agreement.  At that point, determination will be made regarding extension of the Cooperative Agreement and any other changes within the scope of the program.

 The recipient will be asked to design a civic advocacy program suited to the intricacies of the environment in Uzbekistan.  The design will incorporate at least the following components in the two main parts of the activity.  The components are listed below. 

Assessment:
USAID/CAR envisions a maximum two-week feasibility/ design assessment, beginning at the latest in mid-August 2002, which will allow the recipient to identify specific potential partners and to develop a detailed annual workplan.  Based on the results of the assessment and upon the submission of an annual workplan, USAID/CAR will fund the remainder of the cooperative agreement for twenty-four months.

The assessment should address at least the following questions:

&#61623; Who are the potential NNO partners?
&#61623; Which NNOs are presently involved in civic advocacy at the national level and what kinds of issues do they advocate?
&#61623; Which NNOs have the potential to take the next step from advocacy at the local level to the national level?
&#61623; With which NNOs does the recipient expect to partner?  

&#61623; What are the potential partners? needs?
&#61623; What types of activities are the potential partners engaged in currently?
&#61623; What is their organizational structure?
&#61623; What training, technical assistance and financial needs are required for potential partner(s) to reach the point where they can develop advocacy campaigns at the national level?

&#61623; What other resources and assets could be drawn upon?
&#61623; To what extent is the local media interested in reporting on advocacy campaigns?
&#61623; Who are possible government counterparts?
&#61623; What type of collaboration is envisioned with other international organizations?

&#61623; What is the potential for success?
&#61623; What is the current environment for NNOs vis-&agrave;-vis the government?
&#61623; What constraints in the NNO-operating environment exist that may hinder activity implementation?
&#61623; What are potential strategies to deal with these constraints?
&#61623; Realistically, what can be achieved after one year, after two? 


Assistance Program:

USAID/CAR envisions at least the following three aspects to the assistance program:

&#61623; General training on advanced advocacy techniques open to all interested NNOs.  This aspect will be particularly important at the early stages of the activity because it will help identify/confirm specific partners.  It will allow the recipient to gauge the seriousness of interest on the part of potential partners identified during the assessment, identify new partners that may have been overlooked during the assessment, and make any adjustments as necessary.  These training activities could take of the form of seminars, workshops, conferences, and/or round tables.  To maximize the reach of the project, without losing focus on the main partner(s), and to explore the addition of new partners, subsequent general trainings open to various NNOs could be conducted occasionally (at least twice a year) during the course of the term of the Cooperative Agreement.

&#61623; Targeted technical assistance and training for the NNO partner(s).  Given the limited exposure that NNOs presently have to advocacy at the national level in Uzbekistan, considerable training and hands-on technical assistance will be necessary.  Training activities and consultations will need to be tailored for each partner and to the specific topics of the selected advocacy campaigns.  In addition, the recipient will be expected to provide organizational development training to the main NNO partner(s) to ensure that they not only are capable of conducting advocacy campaigns but also develop into strong NNOs that will be able to continue operations beyond the life of this Cooperative Agreement.   In this regard the recipient is encouraged to partner with existing NNO support projects to meet specific developmental needs of the partner(s).  Training activities could take the form of ?on-the job? training, seminars, workshops, or third-country trainings.  The recipient is also encouraged to develop a small cadre of trained individual members of the partner NNOs, who could train new members as needed.

&#61623; Development of advocacy campaigns.  The recipient will work closely with the NNO partner(s) to identify specific, issue-based topics for advocacy campaigns that have grassroots and broad-based appeal among the public.  The campaigns will involve not only the NNO leadership and membership but also volunteers and the general public.  Involvement of the public is key and could take the form of providing information, collecting petition signatures, holding town hall type meetings, or a variety of other forms.  The recipient will assist the partner(s) throughout the entire process, facilitating with the organization and implementation of the campaigns and the actual one-on-one advocacy with government officials in parliament, the Ministries, or other national bodies.  Funding for the campaigns could be provided either via sub-grants or by paying costs directly.  Campaigns could focus around a number of issues, such as consumer rights, environmental issues, student needs, condominium reform, education reform, children?s rights, agrarian reform, or other issues.  Two issue-areas where USAID/CAR is already heavily involved in Uzbekistan and would not want to focus on under this Cooperative Agreement are gender issues and human rights.  Likewise, USAID/CAR is not interested in supporting advocacy work with political parties or political movements in Uzbekistan under this Cooperative Agreement.

Special emphasis should be placed on affecting young Uzbekistan citizens, who hold the key to their country?s democratic future. 

The recipient will be expected to coordinate activities with other USAID democracy assistance providers, as well as with the activities of relevant non-USAID-sponsored international organizations.


V.  EXPECTED RESULTS

Work performed under this award will contribute to the achievement of Strategic Objective 2.1, Strengthened Democratic Culture Among Citizens and Target Institutions, as outlined in the USAID/CAR Assistance Strategy for Central Asia 2001-2005.  This objective reflects USAID?s emphasis on building an active constituency for democracy.  This activity will also serve to further the following intermediate and lower-level results:

IR 2.1.1 Stronger and more sustainable civic organizations
LLR 2.1.1.1 Improved advocacy skills
LLR 2.1.1.2 Increased institutional and financial viability of NGOs
LLR 2.1.1.3 Improved ability to find and represent constituency
LLR 2.1.1.4 Community-based civic action programs expanded/ initiated

The activity should also indirectly contribute toward the following intermediate and lower-level results:

IR 2.1.3 Enhanced opportunities for citizen participation in governance
LLR 2.1.3.2 Improved openness of public institutions to NGO and citizen involvement in the policy process
LLR 2.1.3.4 Increased transparency of government in target sector

As part of the proposal, the applicants should develop tangible results-oriented indicators that measure progress toward the SO 2.1 and the Intermediate and Lower Level Results noted above. In addition, USAID expects the following benchmarks to be met:

- Relationship with partner NNOs established within the first three months
- First trainings held within the first two months of implementation
- First campaign to start within the first five months
- At least three campaigns held in year one
- At least four campaigns held in year two


VI.  PARAMETERS FOR PROPOSALS

 Recognizing that various approaches may have merit, this RFA seeks an implementing partner that, on the basis of its experience, can propose cost-effective ways of strengthening democratic culture through civic advocacy campaigns at the national level.  

In sum, while exercising full creativity and innovation in program design, applicants are asked to address the following fundamental issues in their proposals:

1)	describe, in quantitative terms, the expected impact of the proposed program and relate this expected impact to the way the program will be structured;

2)	describe how client feedback is obtained and used including the methodology used for performance measurement and how the collection and analysis of relevant and reliable data are used for more effective management and better provision of services to customers;

3)	clearly define how the organization will maximize the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the program, including but not limited to programs of conferences, workshops, seminars, and round tables and efficient planning and scheduling of technical assistance and other inputs; and,

4)	describe how the program will actively identify partners for training and for advocacy campaigns.  

Following a maximum two-week assessment, the proposed life of the assistance program is twenty-four months, to begin on or about October 1, 2002.  Towards the end date of the Cooperative Agreements, USAID/CAR will determine the feasibility and usefulness of extending the agreement period.  Within a general twenty-four-month and two-week budgetary envelope of between $800,000 to $900,000, applicants are requested to present a budget that is results-based, includes costs covered by other entities (cost-sharing arrangements or matching funds), and links costs to projected impact.  The cost of the two-week assessment (up to a maximum of $50,000) must be included within the total budget of between $800,000 and $900,000.  Cost sharing is required.  USAID may reject all applications if they are not deemed sufficiently responsive or may determine after the assessment is completed that the activity is not feasible and terminate the agreement.

Introduction B. Mission C. Research Requirements Part II Proposal EvaluationPart III Proposal Preparation  ABSTRACT: The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin AFB FL is interested in receiving research proposals in the areas of:   Vehicles Integration Research  Biomimetic Signal Processing and Control  Autonomous Target Recognition Hardware-in-the-Loop Technology  Laser Radar and Components  Navigation and Control  Computational Weapon/Target Mechanics Damage Mechanisms Research Fuze Research Advanced Energetics Proposals should describe scientific study and experimentation to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas.  This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts:  PART I - Research Interests PART II - Proposal Evaluation  PART III - Proposal Preparation The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals.  PART I RESEARCH INTERESTS A. INTRODUCTION This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.  AFRL/MN contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MN should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/MN scientist identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MN may have in a specific research project. Proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open. However, prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are required to submit a two to three page white paper on their proposed research topic, identifying the key AFRL/MN staff members who have been identified and contacted for each area of interest.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms. Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, EglinAFB FL 32542-6810.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction). Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received. A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate. We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants. Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources. Our goal is to award ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and thirty percent (30%) to small businesses, which includes ten percent (10%) to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), over the life of the BAA. For the purpose of this BAA the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received, which are acceptable regardless of source. This BAA will remain open until superceded.  It will be reissued periodically and may be amended at any time.  The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader will note some overlap between sections.  To contact an AFRL/MN staff member by mail, include branch or division symbol and write: Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate 101 W. Eglin Blvd. Eglin AFB FL 32542 B. MISSION   The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions. The Munitions Directorate plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munition System Program Offices.  There are three divisions within the Munitions Directorate, which conduct research and development. They are the Assessment and Integration Division, the Ordnance Division, and the Advanced Guidance Division.  ASSESSMENT AND INTEGRATION DIVISION (MNA)  The Assessment and Integration Division is responsible for assessment of lethality, effectiveness, and utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. The Division directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, submunition dispensing, and weapon carriage and release concepts. The division also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. MNA maintains in-house facilities and capabilities in the areas of aeroballistics, weaponry aerodynamic performance analysis, and mechanical integration. The Division consists of the Computational Mechanics Branch (MNAC), the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (MNAL), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (MNAV).  ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (MNG)  The Advanced Guidance Division conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in electrooptical, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons and submunition guidance. The Division performs laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts. The Division also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop seeker evaluation facility, an image-processing laboratory, a radio-frequency signal processing laboratory, a laser radar facility, and an electrooptics laboratory. The Division consists of the Seeker Image and Signal Processing Branch (MNGI), the Guidance Simulation Branch (MNGG), the Navigation and Control Branch (MNGN), and the Seeker Branch (MNGS). ORDNANCE DIVISION (MNM) The Ordnance Division directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development of fuzes, warheads, and explosives. Air launched munitions ordnance should consider fighter, bomber, and UAV aircraft as the launch platforms.   Air launched munitions ordnance should be as small as possible but effective against fixed targets, mobile targets and air targets while limiting collateral damage.  MNM operates high explosives R&D facilities that support munitions programs.  MNM also provides technical evaluation and consulting services to other government agencies and industries concerned with munitions technology. MNM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (MNME), the Fuzes Branch (MNMF), the Ordnance Integration Branch (MNMI), and the Damage Mechanisms Branch (MNMW). C. RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS To support the missions of AFRL/MN, research is required in the areas described in this section. These descriptions are not meant to exclude other research topics, which are consistent with the mission of the Munitions Directorate and its Divisions. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas.  VEHICLES INTEGRATION RESEARCH  The goal of this work is to perform flight vehicles integration research in the areas of weapon airframe design, alternate flight control, submunition design dispensing technology, precision emplacement, and compressed carriage missile design.  Applications include high angle-of-attack missile and air-to-surface weapon airframe's rapid response weapon concepts for use on time-critical targets, hypersonic platform and space operating vehicle weapon integration/dispensing, uninhabited combat air vehicle (UCAV) weapon integration/dispensing and micro air vehicles for bomb damage assessment and persistent area dominance.  Research interests include modeling and design of advanced carriage and release equipment for application to both internal and external carriage, especially as applied to small size and weight munitions on  high speed advanced aircraft.  Other areas of interest include:  active and passive control of air vehicles through the use of innovative technologies such as adaptive smart structures, microelectromechancial systems (i.e. micro blowing, synthetic jets), application of weakly ionized gasdynamics (i.e., plasma aerodynamics), micro-parafoil technologies for precision emplacement, and innovative methods for munition strike performance (e.g., BDA). Dr. Mike Valentino AFRL/MNAV 850-882-8879 ext 3331 Fax: 850-882-4793 email: valentin@eglin.af.mil   BIOMIMETIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL  Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Therefore the Seeker Image and Signal Processing Branch has interest in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munition seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division.

Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest. Dr. Timothy J. Klausutis  AFRL/MNGI  850-882-3838 ext 2294 Fax: 850-882-3344  e-mail: klaus@eglin.af.mil  HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP REAL-TIME TESTING TECHNOLOGIES The Guidance Simulation Branch (MNGG) is interested in investigating technologies related to hardware-in-the-loop testing of advanced missile designs. MNGG exercises complete missile hardware-in-the-loop simulations to verify the signal processing, image processing, and guidance performance including terminal homing accuracy. Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) as well as Tactical Munition subsystems developed within WL/MN are tested. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Research emphasis will be placed on advancement of scene projection technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, and high bandwidth motion simulators as they apply to the test of advanced weapon guidance systems. Mr. Tony Thompson AFRL/MNGG 850-882-4446 ext 2273 Fax: 850-882-2363e-mail: thompsra@eglin.af.mil  LASER RADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH The Advanced Guidance Division has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems.  These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems.  Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components.  These include the following: Optical Sources:  Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (< 5 microns) are desired.  These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs).  The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz.  Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials.  Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest.  Detector systems:  Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired.  Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling.  Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors).  Beam pointing and beam scanning systems:  Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired.  Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired.  Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices.  Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest.  Detection schemes:  Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest.  Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation.  Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems:  Systems, which can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required.  These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty.  A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.  Capt Brian A.

Offerors responding to this notice must provide proof that their equipment will meet the requirements stated herein.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

All responses received from responsible sources must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer within ten calendar days of publication of this notice, and must include, at a minimum, equipment brochures, company literature, plus a list of at least three similar facilities who are currently using the suggested equipment.  Simple requests for the solicitation will not be honored.  Information can be sent to NOAA/EASC, Norfolk Federal Building, 200 Granby St., Norfolk, VA 23510 or via fax to (757) 441-3786.

<DESC>AMENDMENT.  THE DESCRIPTION OF WORK IS CHANGED TO INCLUDE REPAIR OF THE TEAK EAGLE FIGUREHEAD, AND GOLD LEAFING OF THE STERN WORK AS WELL AS THE FIGUREHEAD. QUOTE DUE DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL 1 JULY 2002.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A written solicitation will not be issued. This announcement is the solicitation, and quotations are being requested. The solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The RFQ number is DTCG80-02-Q-3FAF03.  The RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.  This is a small business set-aside procurement.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 339950, and the size standard is 500 employees. This requirement is to renew the wooden name board and decorative scrollwork mounted on the stern of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter EAGLE.  The wooden name board is mounted on the centerline of the stern and is approximately 10 feet long, 2 feet high and 6 inches thick.  It is wrapped in carved wood rope that extends approximately 15 feet in both outboard directions wrapping around the stern.  The teak rope is then intertwined with carvings of dolphins and waves.   The new name board and carvings must be identical in appearance to the existing name board and carvings.  The material shall be European Grade Teak with a moisture content of no more than 15 per cent.  Teak laminates may be used.  The contractor shall be available at the U.S. Coast Guard Yard in October 2002 to assist in removal of the old name board and carvings.  The new name board and carvings must be available for installation by March 1, 2003.  The contractor shall be available at the Coast Guard Yard during reinstallation to make adjustments necessary for final fit-up.  Potential offerors shall demonstrate their ability to produce woodcarvings of this quality by providing photographs and three references for similar work done previously.  Offerors shall also submit a manufacturing plan that describes the process for wood selection, laminate manufacture, wood carving, wood finishing and ship installation.  Digital pictures of the existing name board and carvings are available, however it is highly recommended that potential offerors visit the vessel for inspection.  The vessel will be available for inspection in New London, CT until May 13, 2002, in New York City 22-26 May, 2002, and Alexandria, VA 27 May ? 3 June, 2002.

The contractor shall extend to the government the full coverage of commercial sale warranty provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the government.  This will be a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order. Quotes shall address all requirements in this combined synopsis/solicitation, and shall provide clear evidence of understanding, and the ability and willingness to comply with the Government's requirement.  Failure to address a specification requirement will be construed by the Government as inability to meet the need, or the offeror's taking exception to it. The Government anticipates awarding one purchase order resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this synopsis/solicitation will offer the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)Subpart 13.106-2-Evaluation of quotations or offers. Award will be made based on vendors' (A) Manufacturing Capability of the offeror to meet the Governments requirement; (B) Past Performance; (C) Ability to meet Delivery Schedule, and (D) Price.

All interested, responsible, small business firms should submit their quotation no later than June 25, 2002, to U.S. Coast Guard, MLCLANT (vpl-4), 300 E.

<DESC>This is an Invitation to Pre-Qualify, not a request for proposal (RFP).
The U. S. Postal Service, in anticipation of issuing a solicitation for the rental and laundry services of mops (dust and wet), mats (indoor and outdoor), shop towels, uniforms, and related items (referred hereafter as ?custodial rental items?) on a national basis, is seeking to pre-qualify a limited number of suppliers. As a result of the solicitation, the USPS intends to award a single or multiple national contract(s). Subsequent contracts will require suppliers to provide, pick-up, clean, and deliver a full range of custodial rental items to as many as 28,000 USPS locations within the forty-eight contiguous United States, as well as Alaska, Hawaii and its related islands, Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The contracts will also require suppliers to design and implement cost reduction processes throughout the supply chain, applying the principles of Supply Chain Management (SCM). The preferred method of doing business will be to utilize electronic data interchange (EDI) through the Postal Service?s internal Web-Based Purchasing System, eBuy. The supplier must provide and maintain a hard copy, as well as an electronic, catalog. Orders placed through eBuy will be passed electronically to the supplier. Invoicing and payment will also be accomplished via EDI, utilizing, a unique, Postal provided, customer delivery address (FEDSTRIP) number. As all Postal buyers do not have Internet access, the supplier will also be required to provide traditional ordering methods including telephone, fax, and mail. Suppliers will be required to submit quarterly reports and to provide and coordinate all customer service training. The contracts will also require suppliers, if not small businesses themselves, to provide a sub-contracting plan that addresses sub-contracting with small, minority and woman-owned businesses. Suppliers seeking placement on the pre-qualified list must demonstrate that they possess the financial, technical, organizational and managerial resources, and have the experience, operational capability, and quality assurance programs necessary to perform a national contract of this size and scope. Only fifty (50) printed copies of the Invitation to Pre-Quality Package are available for mailing. The closing date for the submission of the Invitation to Pre-Quality package will be June 24, 2002. No Invitations will be accepted after this date. All interested parties are encouraged to participate. This is not a request for proposal (RFP).

<DESC>This amendment is issued to provide additional information in response to questions submitted and to re-establish closing date for quote responses to 24 June 2002.  The following information is provided in answer to various questions received concerning the requirement under this quotation:
Kilowatt Load Max - 96 KW/480V/3 phase
Shop plastisols many different size items which is why we have required a minimum 30" x 30" opening.
There are corrosive issues during curing; this is the reason stainless steel construction and stainless steel hardware is required.  The curing temperature is 500 degrees for this process.
Question:  Do we require a particular wattage in each zone.  Answer:  No, the operating temperature will be zero to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.  There is no "Not to Exceed" temperature.
Question:  Can we use a solid conveyor belt vs wire mesh?  Answer, we requested a wire mesh belt because when we burn off old plastisol it will fall ghrough the belt instead of building up on the belt which would result in high maintenenace and frequent replacement of the belt.  One day on site also includes installation.

The award of this contract is pending, and will soon be announced. This website requires that an award announcement be attached or referenced to a current (not archived) synopsis. Therefore, the previously announced sources-sought synopsis requesting SF-254 & 255 forms had to be un-archived in order to provide the necessary award synopsize with something to reference to. It is anticipated that the award announcement will be made within the next few days. Please do not reply to this mdofication, as its only purpose is to make a future award announcement.

<DESC>Contracting Point of Contact Mr. Alan Wall, Contract Manager, Phone 661-277-8592, Fax 661-275-7885, Email alan.wall@edwards.af.mil. Sources are sought for the anticipated requirement to develop and integrate a Millimeter Wave RF (radio frequency) signal simulation capability into the Radio Frequency Generation and Injection (RFG&I) system developed by Amherst Systems, Raytheon, and Boeing. The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential offerors with the capability of performing the proposed effort in Fiscal Year 2003.   This is a sources sought announcement only.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will not receive a response.  The current RFG&I system provides for the simulation of numerous radar and other RF signals in the 100 MHz to 18 GHz frequency range, with signal activity based on a computer simulation. Simulated signals are radiated into a free space environment using transmit amplifiers and elevated antennas. The current simulator models threat platform motion, threat emitter mode changes, signal pulse characteristics, and transmit antenna scan modulations. A variety of signal modulation types are possible (e.g., amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, phase modulation). The RFG&I system is used in conjunction with an RF monitoring system that allows characterization and identification of radiated signals. The scope of this activity is to extend the frequency range of the simulator to include the 30 to 40 GHz and 90 to 100 GHz millimeter wave bands. The resulting simulation capability will provide for radiating the same types of signals as are currently supported, in the above frequency bands. At least one radiation channel is required in each of these bands. The radiated signals in each band must be time correlated, on a pulse-by-pulse basis, with emitters in the other frequency bands. This upgrade activity will address upgrades to all facets of the system?s capabilities, including the ability to simulate emitters, generate correct RF signals, amplify and radiate signals into free space, and monitor the radiated signals. The expected technical effort includes: developing signal generation and amplification components in the applicable frequency ranges; assembling radiation components (e.g., moveable carts, masts and antennas); implementing upgraded calibration hardware and software; implementing all software, hardware, and firmware changes required to generate simulate signals and control system components; upgrading the existing monitoring capability to support the new frequency bands; installing and testing the system at Edwards AFB; and updating system documentation and drawings. Maximum integration with the existing simulator is required. Current system design information is limited, and access to documentation of certain components is not available due to the proprietary nature of documents and drawings. Government furnished equipment will be provided as available; however, impacts to facility operations using existing equipment will be minimized. The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining how this procurement will be acquired. In order to determine if your company can perform the effort, given the constraints of limited access to critical non-government owned specifications and drawings, we are requesting that each company provide a capability statement, evidence of past experience on related projects and/or existing systems, etc, and other information deemed appropriate to assist the Government in making this determination. This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  All documents may be faxed to Alan Wall at 661.275.7885 or mailed to the aforementioned address by 9 July 2002. You may contact Alan Wall at 661.277.8592 if you have questions about this announcement. If we receive no definite information that other offerors can perform this work, this procurement will be advertised on an other than full and open competition basis. Please be advised of the following: This program will involve technology acquisitions that have military applications and are subject to Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking businesses with the capability of providing in vitro antiviral screening systems for one or more of the following viral categories (This announcement is not a request for proposals):

(1)Herpes  viruses: herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, human  herpes virus-6, human herpes virus-7, and human herpes virus-8,
(2)Respiratory viruses: influenza virus type A and type B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, measles virus, adenovirus type 5, and representatives of rhinoviruses, 
(3) Hepatitis B virus, 
(4) Hepatitis C virus, 
(5) Human papillomaviruses, 
(6) Orthopoxviruses: vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and monkeypox virus, and 
(7) Biodefense pathogens (or their surrogates) that cause viral hemorrhagic fever and/or encephalitis. (For lists of biodefense pathogens, see http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist.asp and http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/bandc_priority.htm) 

 The businesses or organizations we are seeking must have the ability to provide viral screens for one or more of the categories listed and should have the ability to screen for all of the viruses within a  viral category.

The objective of these in vitro screens would be multi-faceted: (1) selective indexes of potential antiviral compounds are determined to guide the selection and prioritization of compounds for evaluations in animal models; (2) active compounds are further evaluated against additional virus strains including clinical and drug-resistant isolates to explore their clinical potential; (3) studies on mechanisms of action and drug combinations are conducted to better understand compounds' pharmacological properties, as well as potential utilization and limitations (e.g., virustatic vs. virucidal activity, systemic vs. topical treatment, synergistic vs. antagonistic drug interaction); and (4) research also is conducted to improve the current screening systems, to develop automated high-throughput screening systems, and to adopt new assays. 
 
There is no RFP available and the government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this Sources Sought Notice. Responses should not include cost or pricing information. PLEASE NOTE: if a solicitation were issued, NIAID would seek approval of a deviation to the standard text within FAR clause 52.227-11 Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997) from DHHS and would obtain clearance from OD, NIH to allow its use in any resultant contract. Also, NIAID would seek approval of a deviation to the standard text within FAR clause 52.227-14 Rights in Data - General (June 1987) from DHHS. The deviation to FAR 52.227-11 will allow those third party compound suppliers who permit the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases to test their compound under contract, to have the right to any subject inventions related to their compounds. The deviation to FAR 52.227-11 would delay the Contractor's publication of the research results related to third party compounds, thus allowing time for the compound supplier(s) to prepare and file patent applications. In addition, if a solicitation were issued and a contract were awarded, the Government may require the use of Screening Agreements or Material Transfer Agreements between the NIAID and providers of compounds in order to protect the intellectual property rights of third party compound suppliers. 

 The Offeror must provide documentation of its capabilities to perform the duties described below.
 
(1)Provide validated screening systems for all of the selected viruses. Conduct evaluation on experimental antiviral substances using proven assays.
a. Determine the inhibitory effect on virus replication and/or infectivity based on meaningful endpoints to determine effective and cytotoxic concentrations and selective indexes. 
b. Determine the inhibitory effect against other virus strains (e.g., clinical isolates, drug-resistant strains) in appropriate cell lines for compounds with reasonable selective antiviral activity.

(2)Perform special studies as directed by the Project Officer, which shall include, but are not restricted to, combination drug testing, mechanism of action studies targeting specific steps in viral replication, and other more detailed testing. Assays pertinent to special studies shall be designed, developed, compared to existing assays, standardized, validated and performed, as necessary.

(3)Evaluate and develop new in vitro testing systems at the direction of the Project Officer.

(4)Receive, Store, and Record substances for testing.
a. Maintain and store frozen stocks of compounds in a sterile manner.
b. Maintain a master list of compounds received for testing, freezer location, usage, and other pertinent information.

(5)Conduct work in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and Local safety and health guidelines and regulations         regarding to exposure to hazardous chemicals and potentially harmful and/or infectious biological materials.

(6)Provide appropriate biosafety laboratory (for reference see, Biosafety in Microbiological and biomedical Laboratories, 4th Ed., May 1999, by CDC and NIH). 

 (7)Provide qualified management and technical personnel.

The training program support to be provided is for two, five-hour sorties per day, five days per week, plus six weekend cross country flights (each with three Remain Over Nights; qualified Airframe and Power plant mechanic must accompany), per year. Aircraft availability is required in the first quarter of FY-04. The aircraft will be based and operated from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; ramp space and maintenance facilities will be provided at Tinker Air Force Base should the operator choose to operate from that site. Naval Pilots will operate the aircraft throughout the continental United States.  Each 737-700 airframe proposed for this effort must show compliance with the following: a current Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Certificate and be able to operate in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation Part 91; all Airworthiness Directives; and the ability to obtain a NAVAIR 4.0 airworthiness flight clearance per NAVAIR Instructions 13030.14 and 13034.1A (the NAVAIR instructions are available from the following web site "http://www.navair.navy.mil"). All organizational and depot maintenance will be the responsibility of the contractor and will be performed in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration approved maintenance planning document for the aircraft offered, tailored to fit the operating environment, approved by the E-6B Program Manager and Assistant Program Manager, Engineering. The Navy is exploring the establishment of a lease contract for a base period of one year plus four one-year options for a total of less than five years. The Navy requires the option to purchase the aircraft outright at any time prior to, during or at the end of the lease agreement. Responses to this sources sought are requested to provide a cost rough order of magnitude (ROM) to execute this contractual arrangement. Responses should provide ROM data to include: outright purchase of the aircraft prior to, during (at the end of each option) and up to 60 days after the end of the lease period; annual maintenance cost to maintain the aircraft in the event the Government purchases the aircraft; "dry" lease (no maintenance/no fuel) of the aircraft for the base year and each option year; "wet" lease (all maintenance/no fuel) of the aircraft for the base year and each option year; and, if required, preparation of the aircraft to qualify the aircraft for the NAVAIR 4.0 airworthiness flight clearance. Lease payments shall not contain equity interest. This request for information is NOT a contract; or a request for proposal; or a promise to contract; or a commitment of any kind. The Navy will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for any data offered for examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to review and use data at its own discretion. Upon request, NAVAIR will protect proprietary information from unwanted disclosure.

<DESC>NA This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS; there is no solicitation at this time.  No response will be provided for request for a solicitation.  This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a market research tool being utilized to det ermine the availability of sources prior to issuing an RFP.  Information any respondent submits as a result of this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse r espondents for information submitted. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH ONLY. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources capable of providing treaty escort/ transportation services and housing support for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) international inspectors and their U.S. Government escorts during their  extended stays for treaty inspections at eight chemical agent disposal facility (CDF) locations within the continental U.S.   The treaty escort/ transportation services primarily include the furnishing of full-time qualified arms control treaty escorts, drivers and vehicle(s). To be qualified escorts and drivers, contractor personnel must possess a SECRET security clearance, pass  an occupational health exam, submit to blood and urine tests, and complete US Government chemical weapons demilitarization, treaty orientation and safety courses, in addition to possessing valid state licenses.  Vehicles consist of a van and possibly up t o 5 additional vehicles at each of the eight CDF locations. The housing support primarily includes providing approximately 8 to 19 hotel-like lodging rooms in a low crime area that is within commuting distance of each of the eight CDF locations and near appropriate amenities and conveniences (restaurants, laundry &  dry cleaning services, etc.).   It also includes office space near the rooms for the lodging driver.  The rooms are for lodging a continual succession of treaty inspectors and escorts, each staying approximately 3-6 weeks. Inherent in performing these services, the contractor would conduct program management consisting of planning, establishing, managing and monitoring the transportation services and the housing support at eight CDF locations throughout the performance perio ds, to ensure quality support.  The CDF Locations, Projected Start Dates; Projected End Dates are as follows: Tooele, UT: Ongoing -- Mar 2008; Anniston, AL: Sep 2002 -- Sep 2011; Umatilla, OR: Feb 2003 -- Apr 2011; Pine Bluff, AR: Apr 2004 -- Apr 2011; New port, IN: Jul 2003 -- Dec 2004; Aberdeen, MD: Mar 2003 -- Sep 2004; Pueblo, CO: Oct 2008 -- NLT Apr 2012; and Blue Grass, KY: Oct 2009 -- NLT Apr 2012. Prior to initiation, the start dates are subject to frequent and often substantial changes.  Likewise, the end dates are subject to change based on the progress made in destroying chemical weapons at each location.  Normally, these changes have been slippa ge into the future.  Currently, the services described in this notice are being provided under two separate contracts (one for treaty escort/ transportation services, and one for housing support at one location).  However, DTRA is considering an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one contractor.  The single IDIQ contractor would either have the ability to perform all of the services at all locations, or would be the prime contractor that can lead a team of subcontractors with the collective ability to perform all of the services at all locations.  The type of contract contemplated is either cost reimbursable with incentives or a combination of fixed price and cost reimbursable with incentives.  Subsequent, task orders would be issued identifying the spe cific efforts, CDF locations, and periods of performance.  The total contract cost for the estimated ten-year period is estimated to be $55 million.  The estimated total cost for the escort services is  $24 million and for the housing is $ 27 million.  Prospective suppliers are requested to provide a capability summary not to exceed five (5) pages in length describing their relevant corporate experience as it relates to this requirement.  In addition, to aid in our acquisition planning for this effort, prospective offerors are asked to provide responses to the following questions, with no page limitation (Please identify service group and the question with appropriate response.):   Service Group #1: Combination of Treaty Escort/ Transportation Services and Housing Support 1.  Would you recommend that the Government award a single contract for both the treaty escort/ transportation services and the housing support requirements described?  What is the basis of your recommendation? 2.  Do you see any inherent problems with the concept of a single contract as set forth above?  If so, what are they and provide your recommendations/suggestions. 3.  Discuss how your organization would provide the required services/support for these CWC requirements?  Discuss whether the technical expertise is organic to your organization (expertise within your organization) or would you establish teaming relations hips?  Explain.  a.  If you would contemplate a teaming arrangement, do you visualize your organization serving as the prime contractor or a team partner subcontractor?  Explain.  b.  Discuss your organization's experience with providing multiple contract services at various locations under a single contract. 4.  Identify the size classification of your organization (i.e., large, small, 8a, women owned, etc.) 5.  What type of contract (cost plus award fee, fixed price, etc.) would you recommend the Government utilize? Explain your recommendation. 6. What kind (ID/IQ, completion, term, etc.) of contract would you recommend? 7.  Has the Defense Contract Audit Agency approved your organization's accounting system?  If so, has your current system been approved and give date of approval? 8.  Do you know of any existing Government contract vehicles (i.e., GWACS) that could support this effort?  Identify and provide agency name, name of contract vehicle, and point of contact. 9.  Would you recommend that the housing support, treaty escorts, drivers and transportation services be acquired under one contract, the services continue to be acquired under the current contract arrangement, or the services be broken out in a different fashion?  Explain your recommendation(s). 10. If you would contemplate a teaming arrangement, what problems would you anticipate in integrating a group of subcontractors either by function (escort, transportation, housing, and project management) at an individual location or by the locations thems elves that might make a single contract unfeasible? Explain.       11.  What technical and/or mission capability/support evaluation criteria would you recommend the Government utilize as the basis for selection of a contractor? Identify and explain your recommendations. 12.  This procurement would require contractor personnel with DoD Secret Clearances.  How would you provide this? Explain. Service Group #2: Treaty Escort/ Transportation Services 1.  Would you recommend that the Government award a separate contract for treaty escort/ transportation services?   2.  How would you locate experienced personnel needed to support treaty escort or other related purposes at remote sites?  Do you have access to personnel with Security clearances?  Explain. 3.  How would you oversee a fleet of vehicles at various sites given the likelihood of frequent and often substantial changes? 4. What type of contract (cost plus award fee, fixed price, etc.) would you recommend the Government utilize? Explain your recommendation. 5. What kind (ID/IQ, completion, term, etc.) of contract would you recommend? 6. What technical and/or mission capability/support evaluation criteria would you recommend the Government utilize as the basis for selecti on of a contractor? Identify and explain recommendations. Service Group #3: Housing Support Services 1.  Would you recommend that the Government award a separate contract for housing support services? 2. How would you locate hotel-like accommodations at the remote sites listed above? Discuss how recommendation(s) to the Government should be formulated and presented.  3.  How would you arrange hotel-like accommodations for groups on a long- term basis given the likelihood of frequent and often substantial changes?  Discuss how you should monitor the service at the various sites simultaneously. 4.  How would you periodically inform the Government of the activities/issues at the sites?  3.  What type of contract (cost plus award fee, fixed price, etc.) would you recommend the Government utilize? Explain your recommendation. 4. What kind of contract (ID/IQ, completion, term, etc.) would you recommend? 5.

<DESC>NA This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS; there is no solicitation at this time.  No response will be provided for request for a solicitation.  This SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This is a market research tool being utilized to det ermine the availability of sources prior to issuing an RFP.  Information any respondent submits as a result of this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse r espondents for information submitted. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH ONLY. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources capable of providing treaty escort/ transportation services and housing support for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) international inspectors and their U.S. Government escorts during their  extended stays for treaty inspections at eight chemical agent disposal facility (CDF) locations within the continental U.S.   The treaty escort/ transportation services primarily include the furnishing of full-time qualified arms control treaty escorts, drivers and vehicle(s). To be qualified escorts and drivers, contractor personnel must possess a SECRET security clearance, pass  an occupational health exam, submit to blood and urine tests, and complete US Government chemical weapons demilitarization, treaty orientation and safety courses, in addition to possessing valid state licenses.  Vehicles consist of a van and possibly up t o 5 additional vehicles at each of the eight CDF locations. The housing support primarily includes providing approximately 8 to 19 hotel-like lodging rooms in a low crime area that is within commuting distance of each of the eight CDF locations and near appropriate amenities and conveniences (restaurants, laundry &  dry cleaning services, etc.).   It also includes office space near the rooms for the lodging driver.  The rooms are for lodging a continual succession of treaty inspectors and escorts, each staying approximately 3-6 weeks. Inherent in performing these services, the contractor would conduct program management consisting of planning, establishing, managing and monitoring the transportation services and the housing support at eight CDF locations throughout the performance perio ds, to ensure quality support.  The CDF Locations, Projected Start Dates; Projected End Dates are as follows: Tooele, UT: Ongoing -- Mar 2008; Anniston, AL: Sep 2002 -- Sep 2011; Umatilla, OR: Feb 2003 -- Apr 2011; Pine Bluff, AR: Apr 2004 -- Apr 2011; New port, IN: Jul 2003 -- Dec 2004; Aberdeen, MD: Mar 2003 -- Sep 2004; Pueblo, CO: Oct 2008 -- NLT Apr 2012; and Blue Grass, KY: Oct 2009 -- NLT Apr 2012. Prior to initiation, the start dates are subject to frequent and often substantial changes.  Likewise, the end dates are subject to change based on the progress made in destroying chemical weapons at each location.  Normally, these changes have been slippa ge into the future.  Currently, the services described in this notice are being provided under two separate contracts (one for treaty escort/ transportation services, and one for housing support at one location).  However, DTRA is considering an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one contractor.  The single IDIQ contractor would either have the ability to perform all of the services at all locations, or would be the prime contractor that can lead a team of subcontractors with the collective ability to perform all of the services at all locations.  The type of contract contemplated is either cost reimbursable with incentives or a combination of fixed price and cost reimbursable with incentives.  Subsequent, task orders would be issued identifying the spe cific efforts, CDF locations, and periods of performance.  The total contract cost for the estimated ten-year period is estimated to be $55 million.  The estimated total cost for the escort services is  $24 million and for the housing is $ 27 million.  Prospective suppliers are requested to provide a capability summary not to exceed five (5) pages in length describing their relevant corporate experience as it relates to this requirement.

<SUBJECT>A--INTERNATIONAL SPACE RESEARCH PARK AT NASA’S JOHN F. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER – ANNOUNCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITY AND DRAFT USE GUIDELINES
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the State of Florida, Florida Space Authority (FSA), are pleased to announce to industry their intent to establish a 400-acre research and technology development park on a premiere location at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. KSC and FSA have concluded a year long Development Study to mature the concept of the planned International Space Research Park (TM) at NASA’s John F. Kennedy Space Center (ISRP) and to evaluate its feasibility.  Subject to the pending approval of NASA Headquarters, KSC and FSA plan to proceed with implementation of the park concept, and hereby invite the public and industry to express comments and interest in participation. This announcement invites comment on draft tenant eligibility and selection guidelines and anticipated types of permitted and prohibited uses.  In addition, KSC and FSA have scheduled an industry briefing for 9:30 a.m. Friday, June 28 at the Universe Theater, Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, to advise commercial developers, potential tenants, and other interested parties of opportunities associated with the proposed park project. The draft guidelines and uses published below are preliminary and subject to change. A detailed park implementation proposal is under review and is subject to approval by NASA Headquarters. Final guidelines and uses publication later this year is anticipated. In addition to opportunities for eligible tenant organizations there may be partnering opportunities for the private sector in park infrastructure improvements and the construction of facilities to be made available for eligible occupants. SYNOPSIS OF THE ISRP PROJECT AND INDUSTRY’S OPPORTUNITY KSC and FSA envision the International Space Research Park as a campus-like and ecologically friendly environment for world-class research and technology development. The ISRP concept anticipates a balanced mix of academic and commercial tenants contributing to the State of Florida’s intellectual capital, the position of the Cape Canaveral Spaceport as the world’s leader in spaceport technology, and the development and commercialization of space. The proposed site for park, currently undergoing environmental analysis, is directly south of the KSC Visitor Complex and west of State Road 3.  It includes a 40-acre site already under development as the Space Experiment Research and Processing Laboratory (SERPL) through a partnership of NASA and the State of Florida. This 100,000-square-foot laboratory will be the gateway for many of the experiments to fly on International Space Station, and will serve as the ISRP magnet facility. The SERPL has been fully leased.  In addition, a new access highway called Space Commerce Way has been largely completed. About 320 acres is available for additional research and technology facilities, university labs and classrooms, and commercial activities consistent with the draft use guidelines described in this announcement. The public partners anticipate establishment of an International Space Research Park Authority empowered to enter into long-term leases on individual parcels with qualified tenants. Qualified tenants may lease or own facility improvements upon these sites, and private developers may improve sites for prospective tenants or develop park infrastructure in partnership with the FSA. DRAFT ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES To be eligible for tenancy in the ISRP, an applicant shall meet at least one of the following guidelines: 1.  The proposed use involves an essential requirement for close proximity to the Cape Canaveral Spaceport’s facilities or personnel; 2.  The proposed use involves a direct relation to the Government’s space-related missions or to Kennedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral Spaceport strategic objectives; 3.  The proposed use involves Research and Development activities that integrate academia, industry, and government entities for the advancement of space, spaceport or range technologies; 4.  The proposed use offers a partnering initiative with industry or academia with mutual benefits to NASA or other Federal agencies and the State of Florida. In addition, the proposed use must substantially serve one or more of the following purposes: 	 1.  Performance of research or technology development at the ISRP, the Cape Canaveral Spaceport, or in space; 2.  Development and growth of space-based and space-related regional, national, and international commerce; 3.  Provision of educational services; including undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate education in spaceport technology or other scientific and technical disciplines applicable to space related activities; technical training and workforce development; educational activities and related outreach consistent with NASA’s vision and mission; or continuing education for space industry professionals; 4.  Creation of commercial products or services related to ISS activities, space experiments or space research/development processing; or licensing and application of technologies produced for or in collaboration with space-faring organizations (government, industry, or academic); 5.  Provision of laboratory or technical support services required by ISRP or Cape Canaveral Spaceport tenants; 6.  Provision of medical and wellness services, food services, office support, and convenience services for park tenants and visitors consistent with location criteria and scope limitations designated in the ISRP master plan. ANTICIPATED PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES NASA will retain the right to approve, disapprove, or approve subject to conditions all uses of the ISRP. In conjunction with FSA, NASA anticipates publication of a “permitted” and “prohibited” uses list to provide site developers and prospective tenants a guide to the types of uses which are desired and those which will not be considered. PROPOSED PERMITTED USES Subject to NASA use and user approval, the following types of uses may be permitted in ISRP facilities:  research laboratories; technical and scientific services laboratories; experiment processing laboratories and facilities; space flight payload and vehicle systems development and testing laboratories; space flight payload and vehicle systems processing and integration facilities; manufacturing of prototypes and components of space flight systems and subsystem elements; development and manufacturing of products and associated processing requiring materials produced or processed in space; development and manufacturing of products using spaceport technologies or other space-derived technology licensed by NASA or other space research and development organizations; offices and administrative services required to support or carry out other permitted uses; clean rooms; software development laboratories; academic facilities, classrooms; meeting rooms and auditoriums required to support or carry out other permitted uses; professional, technical, and business-assistance support service facilities incidental to other permitted uses or in general support of ISRP tenants; and any other use which is deemed consistent with the objectives of NASA’s mission and the ISRP and compliant with the ISRP Master Development Plan.
