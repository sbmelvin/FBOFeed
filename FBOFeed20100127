<SUBJECT>Genotypes for 700 commercial US boars 
<SOLNBR>AG-82HW-S-10-0003
<RESPDATE>021110

<DESC>Background
<p>The purpose of this project is to identify regions of the swine genome associated with female reproductive performance and rebreeding in first parity commercial pigs. DNA from 700 boars with performance data on daughters' reproductive performance will be genotyped with a set of 60,000 DNA markers that are evenly distributed across the genome (Illumina Porcine SNP60 Genotyping Beadchip). Because these boars are being supplied by the swine industry, US swine producers can quickly apply selection upon certain alleles significantly associated with superior daughter performance.</p>
<p>Identifying DNA markers associated with first parity reproductive performance in pigs supports the USDA, ARS Animal Production and Protection, Food Animal Production (NP#101) research plan. <br />This also supports USMARC mission to develop scientific information and new technology to solve high priority problems for the U.S. swine industry, and Reproduction Research Unit mission to develop genetic markers to improve swine production efficiency. Genetic markers for first parity reproductive performance and rebreeding will result in an increase in the average age of the commercial US sow herd. This change will increase production efficiency, and improve the health and well-being of commercial sows.<br /><br />Statement of Work</p>
<p>The provider must provide genotypes for 700 commercial US boars provided to USMARC by commercial swine producers for the same single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that are currently on the Illumina Porcine SNP60 Genotyping Beadchip. These SNP markers are currently the global industry standard for porcine DNA genotyping and have been previously used on a reference set of USMARC swine. All resulting genotypes must be returned to USMARC.</p>
<p>USMARC will provide the contractor the tissue, either in the form of blood cards or hair. These samples will be delivered to the contractor within 1 week after awarded. Delivery of the genotypes (the product the contractor will provide) shall be not later than weeks (to be delivered not later than 56 calendar days) after the tissue samples have been delivered to the contractor.</p>

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all challenges to this sole source determination received within three days after the date of the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Synopsis
<p>Proposals from all business concerns will be accepted for the Foothills Parkway Design-Build (D-B) Project PRA-FOOT 8E14, 8E16, 8E18, 8E19, 8E20, and 8E22, Solicitation Number DTFH71-10-R-00006, located in Blount County, Tennessee, northeast of the city of Townsend near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM). This D-B project consists of the design and construction of new roads and five new bridges. The construction work will include clearing, erosion and sediment control measures, site stabilization and revegetation, roadway excavation and embankment, aggregate base, hot asphalt concrete pavement (HACP), retaining walls, soil nailing, drainage improvements, stone masonry, and other miscellaneous work. The proposed project limits are within existing National Park Service (NPS) right-of-way.</p>
<p>The roadway work will include full-depth pavement structure design but will not include placement of the final surface course. The pavement structure constructed under this D-B contract must be capable of supporting future construction traffic. The design/construction of the asphalt base course may include a chip seal. Roadway sections are to be designed for the future installation of permanent traffic control and guardrail; however there is no permanent traffic control or guardrail to be constructed under this D-B contract.</p>
<p>Bridge approaches will be constructed to final profile and may include both cut and fill retaining walls. All new retaining walls, bridges, piers, abutments, etc., will be required to continue the aesthetic look of other similar structures along the Foothills Parkway.</p>
<p>The project will be split into multiple work schedules/bid options, with the cost of the entire D-B contract expected to exceed $20,000,000. This project will be partially funded through the American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act of 2009. Contract Award is subject to the availability of funding (SAF).</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 104-106 (41 U.S.C. 253m), the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration is conducting a "two phased" D-B selection process for the National Park Service. Solicitation documents for Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), should be issued in February 2010. Qualifications will be due as specified on the SF 1442 to the EFLHD office in Sterling, Virginia.</p>
<p>A selection committee will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select at least three of the most highly qualified D-B firms/teams based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process. During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements.</p>
<p>Please send all questions concerning construction projects to eflhd.contracts@dot.gov. <br />Include the solicitation number, project name and number, requesting firm and address, a point of contact and telephone number. Requests for 'faxing' or overnight mailing will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Use Internet addresses http://www2.efl.fhwa.dot.gov/Documents.aspx or https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=list&amp;tab=list to check for availability of bid documents. All bid documents can be directly downloaded from these websites. Documents will no longer be mailed.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Honeywell TechnologySolutions, Inc. (HTSI) pursuant to 10 U.S.C  2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source insupport of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center Flight Projects Directorate. This procurement is to extend the period of performance/effective ordering period ofcontract NNG04DA00C, Near Earth Networks Services(NENS), for a period of 1 year fromApril 9, 2010 through April 8, 2011.  Also, there will be an increase in the Core andIDIQ estimated values in order to allow for the continuation of services, themodification of existing services, and for new work until the Space CommunicationsNetworks Services(SCNS) competitive follow-on contract is awarded.  The contractextension and increase in Core and IDIQ values is necessary in order to ensure programcontinuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical andprogrammatic impacts to NASA programs.	  The scope of the existing work encompasses the following functional requirements: Project and Network Management, Planning, Management Reporting/Reviews, FinancialManagement, maintain and meet Performance Metrics, Property and Logistics Management,Configuration Management and Control, Security Management, Safety and Health Management,Quality Assurance, Environmental Management, Space Network Operations, TDRS FlightOperations, TDRS Console Support, Scheduling/Control/Status, NCCDS Operations, Schedulingof Non-customer Activities, Service Accounting, Engineering Configuration Management,Documentation Maintenance, Facilities Operations, and Maintenance, Custodial Services,Facilities Configuration Management and Documentation, SN Security, SN Logistics, WSCAdministrative Computing, Networking, and Telecommunications, System Engineering andDevelopment, Engineering Studies, Mission Networks Loading, Modeling and Analysis,Requirements Development, Testing Simulations, and Integration, Hardware and SoftwareDevelopment, Facilities Engineering,  Sustaining Engineering, Software Maintenance,Hardware Maintenance, Logistics, Ground Network Space Communications Services, SatelliteLaser Ranging Network Operations, NASA Integrated Services Network Interface support,Mission Unique Equipment support, Facilities Operations and Maintenance, and AlternateWide Area Network Services.  HTSI as the current incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of government facilities,networks and systems, management structure and personnel to provide uninterruptedcontinuation of mission critical support.  An interruption and restart of the servicescurrently being performed with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with the existingnetworks, facilities, and the specific requirements of the NENS contract, would greatlyjeopardize the success of space exploration goals and valuable on-orbit assets as managedby various NASA directorates.  Due to the time and substantial duplication of costsinvolved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, HTSI is considered the onlycontractor that can meet NASAs GSFC needs given the short period of performance for theextension.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon February 11, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The Acquisition and Grants Office, Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Norfolk, VA on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for at-sea monitors to collect information on marine fish. The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data for fisheries by placing at-sea monitors aboard U. S. domestic fishing vessels participating in the groundfish multispecies Fisheries Management Plan. This information is required in response to the implementation of Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (NEFMP). The at-sea monitors collect scientific, management, compliance, and other data at sea through interviews of vessel captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, photographing catch, and measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear. The primary responsibility of the at-sea monitor will be to collect accurate actual weights on the discard portion of the catch, as well as account for all catch (kept and discarded) on each tow. The work requires deploying trained at-sea monitors to meet coverage levels prescribed in Amendment 16. NEFSC will train the contractor's monitors once the contract is awarded as needed and at the Government's expense. The Contractor shall support, as specified, the at-sea monitors during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy monitors on board groundfish vessels, normally out of ports from New York to Maine. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for monitors, and reimbursing for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from New York to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 14 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and at-sea monitors live and sleep in close quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals. Monitors must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their primary ports.
<p>The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $7 million. This acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation and is being competed as a 100% small business set-aside. The Government anticipates awarding multiple fixed-price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts. Each contract will be for a two-year ordering period.</p>
<p>The contract award date is anticipated to be April 15, 2010 with an ordering period of two (2) years thereafter. Request for Proposal (RFP) EA133F-10-RP-0053 will be available on or about February 11, 2010 through the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The estimated due date for proposals is March 12, 2010. The basis for proposal evaluation will include, in descending order of importance: Technical Requirements, Past Performance, and Price. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than price. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps register to make use of the notification feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Change Division, Climate Economics Branch (CEB) intends to award a sole source Time and Materials contract to Dale Jorgenson Associates (DJA).   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620.  Market research was conducted in an effort to determine if other firms were capable and could respond to EPA?s technical requirements.   There was no response to EPA?s FedBizopps sources sought inquiry.   The lack of responses to EPA's notice contributed to the determination that currently, there is only one responsible source capable of meeting these unique requirements.
EPA requires analytical services in the form of model outputs from a specialized computable general equilibrium model.  The model must be capable of estimating economic impacts of emissions mitigation and must be flexible to track emissions and mitigation costs for various greenhouse gas and sequestration options.  The model needed must be econometrically estimated from data for the U.S. economy and must be at least as disaggregated as the two digit NAICS data.   The work under this award is a continuation and expansion to the current work performed by DJA.   There is NO SOLICITATION for this requirement.   The contract award will be for a 12 month base year and four, 12 month option periods for a total of 60 months (5 years).  Interested parties can find the identical Statement of Work on the EPA office of Acquisition Management website, at the following address:  
http//www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/1010489/index.htm.  Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting these requirements will be considered.  Written responses must be submitted via email to the sole point of contact, Margaret Kline, Contract Specialist at kline.margaret@epa.gov no later than 2:00 pm EST 12 February 2010, No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

U.S. EPA?s Coalbed Methane Outreach Program (CMOP) is a voluntary program within the Climate Change Division (CCD).  CCD works to assess and address global climate change and the associated risks to human health and the environment.
The intended work will require assistance to EPA to prepare analyses and assessments of coal mine methane project opportunities, technologies, and end uses to facilitate EPA development and implementation of projects in the US, other industrialized countries, countries with economies in transition, and developing countries, with particular focus on key Methane to Markets Partnership (M2M) Partner countries (i.e., China, India, Ukraine, Poland).  Assessments shall encompass mines both with and without significant experience in methane recovery and use, and shall also consider commercially available as well as new and emerging technologies.  
Most work performed shall focus on reducing Coal Mine Methane (CMM) emissions including methane emitted from active underground and surface mines, abandoned mines (AMM), and from mine ventilation systems (ventilation air methane VAM).  Broad work areas include but, are not limited to: Project Development and Implementation Support; Technology Transfer Support; Outreach Support; Technical and analytical support; Coal Mine Methane Emission Inventories; and Policy and Regulatory Support.  The Contractor will provide all related services, direct and indirect, domestic and international to support the mission of CCD with respect to CMM and the Methane to Markets Partnership.  The purpose of this notice is to notify potential offerors of EPA?s forthcoming requirement.  Note that Offerors with financial and/or business relations with power generating companies, natural gas providers, developers of emerging CMM technologies, and other point source emitters of methane may have an organizational conflict of interest.  This may result in elimination of the offeror from further consideration.  EPA intends to issue a solicitation for fixed rate, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with at least one award to a large business, and with a partial small business set-aside for at least one small business.   
The North American Industry Code (NAICs) is 541330 Engineering Services for the small business size standard.  Each contract award is expected to have a twelve month base period and four, twelve month option periods for a total performance period of up to five years.  The issuance date for the solicitation is expected to be released on or about February 28, 2010.   
All contract awards will be issued from one solicitation.  Interested parties will be able to find this notice, the Solicitation, any amendments, and other information related to this procurement on the EPA office of Acquisition Management website, at the following address:  http//www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/1011067/index.htm.  Interested parties must monitor the internet site for the status of this solicitation and shall download the solicitation and any related documents from the internet site.  All information regarding this procurement will be available at this internet site until the date of contract award. 
Documents will not be mailed to interested parties unless an offeror provides written certification that internet capability is unavailable.  The anticipated award date for this procurement is anticipated on or about September 2010.   Contract award will be made using best value determination where technical merit is more important than cost.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  All questions related to this procurement must be directed via email to the sole point of contact to Margaret Kline, Contract Specialist, at kline.margaret@epa.gov and Debbie Miller, Contracting Officer, at miller.debbie@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPERTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO FIRMS WHO HOLD A GSA SCHEDULE 70 CONTRACT.

THIS PROCURMENT WILL BE FUNDED VIA THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.


The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation intends to issue two competitive task order contracts, entitled Leveraging Health Data for Rapid Comparative Effectiveness Analysis Pilot Test, using the GSA Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services Contracts, Group 70. These two contracts are part of the Office of the Secretary comparative effectiveness research (CER) portfolio from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The purpose of these two contracts is to pilot test the ability to link healthcare data and utilize next generation analytical applications to query the data.  This pilot test, if successful, would substantially increase the yield of database investments and other Federal data resources. The Federal government seeks to establish a rapid-prototyping environment to pilot test the potential to link health care data.  It also seeks to utilize next generation analytical applications to answer specific CER questions. The offerors should use existing technology platforms and customize their application for use in a rapid pilot test environment of analytic tools for CER. The environment and tools will be used to integrate, analyze, and visualize data from diverse data sources.  The contractor will need to maintain appropriate security and privacy safeguards.  The contractor will be required to pilot test use of the analytical platform to:

A.	Link data from Federal data sets and other sources, which may include databases of patient, provider, and demographic data.
B.	Design and create a user interface to query the linked database.
C.	Use the linked database to perform sample analyses based on specific CER questions in cooperation with the Federal government. 

The estimated Period of Performance for these requirements is 2 years.

Interested vendors with a valid GSA Schedule 70 Contract may find this solicitation on GSA eBuy, https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov, under RFP 10-233-SOL-00062.

The purpose of this RFP is to obtain warehouse services for USAID Title II Food Aid Pre-position program commodities. Such commodities will consist of packaged agricultural products to be used to respond to humanitarian emergencies worldwide, with an emphasis on the Horn of Africa. This RFP will seek proposals for warehouse services at one or more locations within each of the five regions specified below. Contractor will be required to provide warehouse space at the offered warehouse locations upon request by USAID. However, contractor need not maintain open warehouse space when not required by the USAID food aid program. Contractor will be required to have warehouse space available in any/all proposed warehouse locations at the request of USAID with 30-day notice. It is anticipated that two locations will be maintained throughout the duration of the contract, although USAID may require greater or fewer warehouse locations be opened as program requirements dictate. USAID anticipates one warehouse location in the United States Gulf Coast region; and one near the Horn of Africa with preference for Djibouti. Other proposed warehouse locations should be based on historical data of Food for Peace responses to emergency food aid requirements, which will be included in the RFP. Warehouses will be maintained on behalf of USAID for a required period of time. At the end of the required time period, USAID will request that the warehouse(s) services cease at that location.<br /><br />Regions:<br />Horn of Africa: Supporting areas from Algeria to Somalia<br />Central and Southern Africa: Supporting areas from Kenya to South Africa<br />South East Asia: Supporting areas from Afghanistan to Japan<br />West Africa: Supporting areas from Northern Mauritania to Angola<br />United States Gulf Area: Supporting areas from Central America to the Caribbean<br /><br />This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. The USAID authorized geographic code for this activity is 935.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More than one award may be made by the government.<br /><br />The RFP is expected to be published during February 2010, and will be distributed through this website.

<DESC>MCMG Operational Improvements, Strategic Planning, and Support<br />Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
<p>Introduction: This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of certified Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) contractors that can provide support services to the Medicare Contractor Management Group (MCMG) in areas relating to the procurement needs assessment, implementation, administration and performance assessment of all Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims processing contractors. This support requires a special focus on the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). The contractor will perform activities associated with the analysis, documentation of, and improvement plans for the current and future program design.</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help CMS plan its acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract or a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.<br /><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 (Public Law 108-173) enhanced the mission of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to foster excellence in the design and administration of CMS's programs through the authorization of changes in CMS's contracting authority for critical functions related to reimbursement of medical providers for services rendered under the original FFS Medicare program. Many of Congress's mandates for the extensive overhaul of Medicare's administrative structure are contained in Sections 911 and 912 of the MMA, collectively known as "Medicare contracting reform." When implementation is complete, the FFS Medicare claims administration operations now carried out by the fiscal intermediaries and carriers will be performed by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs). The transition of claims processing operations to the MACs must be completed by October 2011.</p>
<p>CMS's Medicare Contractor Management Group (MCMG) is responsible for both the management of the current FFS contractors and the acquisition, implementation, and management of the MACs. As the transition to MACs moves from initial contract acquisition through implementation and administration, MCMG has a greater need to develop and manage standard processes, policies, information delivery, and communications related to the technical review of the program administration structure. Program administration areas include procurement needs assessment, implementation, administration and performance assessment. The purpose of this effort is to obtain support services to perform activities associated with the analysis and documentation of current and future MCMG program design, as well as to identify areas for process improvement. The results of this project will ensure the following outcomes in MCMG:<br /><br />&bull; Program administration technical review knowledge will be retained and transferable.<br />&bull; Documentation of business processes will be current and reflective of actual processes in use.<br />&bull; Consistent and predictable processes and expectations among program stakeholders will ensure effective and efficient program administration.<br />&bull; Critical and high value business priorities in need of optimization will be identified.<br />&bull; High value improvement initiatives will be implemented successfully.<br /><br />This project is anticipated to be performed during a 12-month period with one 12-month option period. The level of effort is estimated to be approximately 1900-2000 labor hours during the base year and approximately 900-1000 labor hours during the option year.</p>

<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />For<br />Medical/Surgical Navy Fleet Prime Vendor Contract<br />Defense Supply Center Philadelphia</p>
<p><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia Medical Directorate has been tasked to solicit for and award a Tailored Logistics Support Prime Vendor contract to service the United States Naval Fleet, which includes all Navy ships, all Naval Field assets, etc. within CONUS (continental United States) and OCONUS (outside the continental United States), such as the hospital ships (while in reduced operating status and after activation status), Seabee Units, Special Warfare Units, Special Operations Units, and Military Sealift Command Shifts. The Prime Vendor will be required to supply approximately 7,000 medical/surgical line items under this program, including, but not limited to, the following federal stock classes: 6510 surgical dressing materials; 6515 - medical and surgical instruments and supplies; 6530 - hospital furniture, equipment, utensils, and supplies; and 6532 - hospital surgical clothing, and related special purpose items. The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price contract. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of the 8(a) the Small Business Community to include to compete and perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Government is seeking to determine if there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive 8(a) contractors.<br />Estimated dollar value is $1,604,000.00<br />Duration of project is a maximum of 6 months.<br />North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this acquisition is 339112, Medical, Dental, and Hospital Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers. The small business size standard for this acquisition is 50 employees.<br />Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under the sources sought synopsis.<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />1. SCOPE: The Prime Vendor (PV) shall provide all identified medical/surgical products required by the U.S. Navy fleet units.</p>
<p>ORDERING PATTERNS AND PROCESSES: The ordering patterns of the fleet are as follows:<br />A. The Routine Fleet items will be ordered from the Routine Fleet Ordering List (RFOL) for which the PV has been authorized as a distributor under DSCP Medical Distribution and Pricing Agreements (DAPAs) or under Indefinite Delivery-Type Contracts (IDTCs). In addition, the PV is authorized to supply an item(s) appearing on the RFOL that is not covered by a DAPA or IDTC; however, the PV shall not charge a distribution fee in connection with said item(s) where the Government and the PV have entered into either a firm fixed price or cost -plus-flat-fee contract for the same item at its delivered cost. Routine ordering, order confirmation, and invoicing will be via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), using the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 transaction sets (850,855, and 810). Each delivery order issued will list an individual requirement for ONE item - i.e., a single part number/Universal Product Number UPN) and/or National Stock Number (NSN). The quantity of each item per order shall be as the customer demands. The PV shall individually package and mark each item with the UPN/Manufacturer Part Number and deliver to the ISSOT Hampton Roads address (shown on page 10).</p>
<p>B. The Government estimates that 1,250 orders per month will be transmitted to the contractor, <br />covering approximately 2,500 individual items. This order estimate may be adjusted (increased or decreased) as a result of changes in either the Department of Defense or world conditions. The Government reserves the right to support other deployed forces during contingency operations through delivery orders placed against this contract.</p>
<p>2. ITEMS COVERED: Only items appearing on the RFOL as STOCKED items are required to be available for ordering and immediate delivery under this contract. All items are brand name specific or generic commercial products, which are identified by the manufacturer's commercial item description and part number/UPN, and conform to the manufacturer's commercial specifications. The annual fleet requirements will cover approximately 3,000 different line items. The estimated sales volume reflects the annual estimated requirements based upon available usage figures. The Government reserves the right to add and delete items, as required, during the term of this contract.</p>
<p>3. ITEM LIST AND USAGE DATA RFOL: Separately provided list of items used by the fleet on an annual basis. This list is subject to change by item additions or deletions as required by the Government. Not all items are currently covered by DAPA agreements.</p>
<p>A. STOCKED items: Items identified with usage data of 5 units per year or more. Items with usage data of less than 5 units/year may be added only with the agreement of the PV. The fill-rate requirement will be in effect thirty days after the Contracting Officer provides written notification to the PV that a DAPA-covered item is added to the RFOL.</p>
<p>B. NON-STOCKED items: Items with either no identified usage data or usage of less than 5 units per year. These items are not subject to specific fill-rate calculations but are targeted for delivery to the ISSOT within 15 days of order placement. The PV will provide to the Contracting Officer periodic (annually as a minimum) usage reports on all NON-STOCKED items with recommendations for establishing a monthly or annual usage quantity for purposes of transferring it to STOCKED item status.<br />4. SUBSTITUTES: Demand data will identify a primary UPN/Manufacturer Part Number for each National Stock Number (NSN) ordered. Data MAY also identify a secondary or tertiary item as an authorized substitute. The delivered item shall be that with the quantity that matches or comes closest to the quantity ordered, giving preference to the primary, then the secondary, and lastly the tertiary item. (Examples: [1] Order is for 10 units. The primary item has 9 units in stock; the secondary has 10 units; no tertiary. The secondary item shall be shipped. [2] Order is for 5 units. The primary has 5 units in stock; the secondary has 5 units in stock; and the tertiary has 6 units in stock. The primary item shall be shipped.)</p>
<p>NOTE: Commingling of items is not authorized. (Example: An order is for 10 pairs of scissors. The contractor has 5 pairs of the primary item, and 5 pairs of the secondary item in stock. The order can be partially filled for 5 pairs of the primary item. The balance of the order will be "killed.")</p>
<p>5. ORDERING OFFICE: All orders will be issued centrally by the ordering activity, i.e.: Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, unless otherwise authorized by a DSCP Contracting Officer. Routine and emergency orders may be placed up to and including the last day of the contract period.</p>
<p><br />6. MINIMUM PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. Fill Rate: Maintain, at a minimum, a 90% fill rate for STOCKED item orders. The fill rate will be individually calculated on a monthly basis for each fleet unit, as identified by the DODAAC (6-position alpha/numeric characters transmitted on each order), as well as for the contract overall. The Government intends to monitor the items to track substitution of the primary Manufacturer Part Number/UPN, the importance of supplying the primary item, except in the case of a manufacturer backorder cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>B. Fill/Partial Fill: Supplies will be furnished on a "Fill-Partial Fill" basis. When an order cannot be filled in its entirety, the PV must partially fill an order for an item and the remaining quantity must be canceled.</p>
<p>C. Backorder: If the full quantity of an item is on backorder, the PV will backorder the item and notify the ordering activity (DSCP) with the expected "get well" date as long as it is 30 or less days from order placement. An order for a backordered item with a projected release date of more than 30 days from order placement will not be placed on backorder; it will be "killed". The PV will receive a maximum of 75% credit for the Fill Rate Calculation for backordered items (excluding manufacturer backorders).</p>
<p>D. Manufacturer Backorder: Manufacturer's backordered items are excluded from the fill rate calculation. This includes all lines that are completely unfilled or only partially filled due solely to a manufacturer backorder. For completely unfilled items, if a manufacturer's backorder is expected to exceed 30 days the order will always be "killed". The PV must clearly indicate to the ordering activity that the unfilled order is the result of a manufacturer backorder for credit under the fill rate calculation.</p>
<p>E. Fill Rate Calculation:</p>
<p>An order is submitted to the PV via EDI 850 transmission. Successful order placement (start time) is determined by the receipt of functional acknowledgment 997. Orders received after 0000 hours (midnight) and before 17:00 hours (5 P.M.) will be considered received that day and due within 3 business days thereafter. Orders received after business hours 1701 hours (5:01 PM) through 2359 hours (11:59 P.M.) will be considered received on the following business day and are due within 3 business days thereafter.</p>
<p>Example: An order is received at 1400 hours on Tuesday, January 24th, 2006; the order must be delivered by close of business (COB), Friday, January 27th, 2006. An order is received on Wednesday, January 25th, 2006 at 0030 hours; that order must be delivered by COB Monday, January 30th, 2006. An order is received at 1800 hours, Wednesday, January 25th 2006; that order must be delivered by COB Tuesday, January 31, 2006. Any order not having a corresponding functional acknowledgment (997) will be adjusted accordingly to reflect a revised start date. Delivery date (end time) will be determined by ISSOT reported receipt date. Receipt date will be reconciled with the vendor-supplied proof of delivery data.</p>
<p>Stocked items filled within three (3) business days receive 100% credit. Stocked items filled within 30 business days that have been placed on a valid backorder by AMD will receive 75% credit. For example, orders placed that cannot be filled resulting from usage spikes or delayed shipment from supplier, for which status expected delivery date is provided are considered a valid backorder. Stocked items not received within 30 days that were on a valid backorder status receive no credit. The Contracting Officer has the option to validate backorders.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>Valid Backorder: An item on the agreed upon stockage list that does not have sufficient quantities on hand to fulfill the requested order, but to be sold or delivered when it becomes available at a later date.</p>
<p>Total Stocked Lines Ordered: The total number of stocked line orders placed minus any manufacturer backorders. This total includes supplier or supply chain backordered items.</p>
<p>Total Stocked Lines Unfilled: The total number of stocked items not filled within three business days. This total includes supplier or supply chain backordered iems.<br /><br />Total Stocked Lines Unfilled Within 3 Business Days<br />Total Stocked Lines Ordered</p>
<p>Plus</p>
<p>Total Stocked B/O Lines (Excluding Manufacturer B/Os) Filled Within 30 Business Days Of Order <br />Placement x 75% Credit Factor<br />Total Stocked Lines Ordered</p>
<p>Sample Stocked Item Fill Rate Calculation<br />Total Stocked Lines Ordered = 2000<br />Total Stocked Lines Unfilled Within 3 Business Days = 200<br />Total Stocked Backorder4ed Lines Filled Within 30 Business Days = 100</p>
<p>200 = .10 or 10%<br />2000</p>
<p>100 x 75% (.75) = 75__ 3.75%<br />2000 2000<br />Stocked Fill Rate % = (100% - 10%) + (3.75%) = 93.75%</p>
<p>F. Routine Order Delivery: The PV shall deliver all routine orders within 3 business days after order placement to the consolidation point address (sometimes called the "Ship To") shown below:<br />Prior to 1 Mar 2010: Beginning 1 Mar 2010:</p>
<p>ISSOT Hampton Roads Defense Distribution Depot Norfolk Virginia<br />1860 Leutze Blvd. Receiving Officer DDNV <br />Bldg SDA 216 1968 Gilbert Street<br />Norfolk, VA 23511 Norfolk, VA 23512-0001</p>
<p>G. Dated/Shelf Life Items: The PV shall provide only dated/shelf life products bearing an expiration date/shelf life with at least 12 months remaining upon delivery to the Government. For items with 12 months or less expiration dating at time of manufacture, at least 75% of the original dating must remain at time of delivery. The PV shall recommend which items on the RFOL should be designated "dated/shelf life" items based upon industry practice. The Government shall make the final determination of which items are "dated/shelf life" items, and is responsible for providing this list to the ISSOT.</p>
<p>H. Packing Slip/List: Two copies of the packing slip/list shall be enclosed with each order and at a minimum will contain the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Vendor's Name<br />(2) Contract Number<br />(3) Delivery Order Number<br />(4) Date of Order<br />(5) Requisition Number (Government's 14-position number transmitted with each order)<br />(6) Description of Item<br />(7) Manufacturer Name &amp; Part Number/UPN<br />(8) National Stock Number<br />(9) Quantity Ordered<br />(10) Quantity Shipped<br />(11) Unit of Issue<br />(12) Delivered Unit Price [This is composed of the DAPA price; the PV's distribution <br />fee, plus the applicable DSCP cost recovery factor (CRF).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I. Emergency Orders</p>
<p>(1) The PV shall accept and process emergency orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. DSCP may place such orders with the PV by any means available, including telephone. The PV will provide DSCP with the telephone number and/or pager number of the PV representative responsible for providing this service. The PV will provide an unlimited number of emergency orders with transportation/handling charges invoiced separately. The following is provided for clarification of emergency-order shipments:</p>
<p>Each requirement to a single DODAAC will be assigned an individual delivery order number. All delivery order numbers (up to a maximum of 25) placed simultaneously for a single DODAAC, for delivery to one location, will constitute a single emergency-order shipment for the following transportation/handling expense assessment:</p>
<p>East Coast Delivery: Amount per pound (to be determined) plus flat fee (below) <br />West Coast Delivery: Amount per pound (to be determined) plus flat fee (below)<br />Alaska/Hawaii: Amount per pound (to be determined) plus flat fee (below)</p>

(2) below).</p>
<p>(2) Emergency order delivery shall be made within 24 hours of order placement anywhere within the fifty United States.</p>
<p>7. MINIMUM ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE CAPABILITY</p>
<p>Note: DSCP will not use a PV's electronic order entry system in conjunction with this contract.</p>
<p>A. The contractor shall accept receipt of routine orders, via its Value Added Network (VAN), on a daily basis. Notwithstanding the proceeding, DSCP will transmit orders to the contractor's VAN in accordance with DSCP's normal business process. Orders may be transmitted to the PV's VAN multiple times daily, at any time of the day, including weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>B. For routine fleet ordering, the PV shall have the capability to receive, via a VALUE-ADDED-NETWORJK (VAN), all orders electronically transmitted by DSCP in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12, 850 Purchase Order transaction set. DSCP will transmit each order to the vendor's VAN mailbox. DSCP's sample ANSI X12 Purchase Order transaction set mapping has been provided separately.</p>
<p>C. The PV shall transmit to DSCP's VAN an acknowledgment of each order in accordance with the ANSI X12 855 Purchase Order Acknowledgment transaction set. The acknowledgment shall be provided within four business hours following placement of the order with the PV's VAN.

Item status must also be provided, when appropriate (e.g., manufacturer backorder). DSCP's sample ANSI X12 855 Purchase Order Acknowledgment transaction set mapping has been provided separately.</p>
<p>D. After shipment of the order the PV shall submit an electronic invoice, using the ANSI X12, 810 Invoice transaction set, to the payment office. Only ONE electronic invoice per delivery order shall be submitted.</p>
<p>(1) Routine fleet order invoices will show an exact quantity matching the quantity shipped, and since every order will only contain one line item, the dollar value will be the total dollar value of the order.</p>
<p>(2) For emergency orders (which may be composed of many delivery orders), the transportation/handling expense shall be entered in the appropriate data element on one 810- transaction set. DSCP must be advised telephonically which delivery order 810 transaction set will incorporate the transportation/handling expense.</p>

<p>E. An individual delivery order number will be assigned by DSCP at the time of order <br />placement. Each delivery order number will contain 17 characters of the 13-character contract number (e.g., SPM20010D7000), plus a 4-character supplementary identification number (Delivery Order Number), (e.g., A001). The 13-character contract number will remain fixed for the entire term of the contract. The supplementary number will be unique for each order and may be any combination of alphas and numerics.

<p>B. All issues involving discrepant orders will be handled by either the DSCP Contract Administrator or the Contracting Officer's Representative (CORF) located at the Consolidation Point.</p>
<p>C. Normally the PV shall replace returned products. If the ordering activity does not need replacement of the returned products, the PV shall issue an "open credit" which can be used against a subsequent order in accordance with applicable laws and regulation. The PV will not include this "open credit" amount in its invoices. Credit accounts shall be based on each individual Fleet Unit (DODAAC); however, only the ordering activity (DSCP) can coordinate the application of these "open credits" with the PV.</p>
<p>10. LOW UNIT OF MEASURE (LUM)</p>
<p>The PV will be required to fill orders for various items in less than case quantities, but the PV will have the right to accept or reject the addition of individual items to be supplied in low unit of measure.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE</p>

After 5 days, the receiving facility shall return the materiel to the PV at the PV's expense.</p>
<p>B. The Government will pay the PV only for materiel the receiving facility has received and accepted.<br /><br />12. PACKAGING, PRESERVATION AND MARKING</p>
<p>A. The PV shall package and identify each order separately while maintaining item integrity. For delivery purposes, multiple orders may be combined in an exterior container; however, EACH order within the container shall be packaged separately and have two copies of the packing slip/list attached. Dated or shelf life items shall not be mixed with non-dated, non-shelf life items. The exterior shall indicate that the product is dated, if appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, preservation, packaging and packing shall be to a degree of protection needed to preclude damage to containers and/or contents thereof under normal shipping conditions. It must also conform to normal commercial practice and comply with applicable carrier regulations involving shipment from the PV to the receiving location cited in the delivery order. Commercial markings not interfering with the clarity or positioning of required markings on the container must be maintained.</p>
<p>B. When an order contains an item requiring special handling and storage, the PV shall appropriately mark each package and annotate the packing list with the following statement: "REQUIRES SPECIAL HANDLING AND/OR STORAGE". (Examples of the special handling and storage requirements requiring this statement are: "STORE BETWEEN 2 DEGREES - 8 DEGREES C (35 DEGREES - 46 DEGREES F)," "KEEP FROZEN", and "FLAMMABLE".)</p>
<p>C. The PV shall appropriately package and mark, in accordance with industry standards, all refrigerated, flammable, hazardous, and other materiel with special shipping requirements.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARD AND TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT DIVISION TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. The Government is soliciting information to determine the availability of all socioeconomic small business groups capable to perform the requirement indicated below. 

Background:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, Manufacturing Extension Partnership (NIST/MEP) seeks to capture business data on its clients which will be used to augment MEPs client/project information and will be used to analyze and evaluate MEP product and service delivery and MEP center performance. NIST MEP is a network of roughly 59 centers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico and serves roughly 8,000 clients annually. This includes a third party validation of the establishment NAICS code (and tertiary NAICS codes) and other establishment level information.
The MEP is seeking detailed data on U.S. based establishments (and Puerto Rico), primarily small and medium-sized establishments, in the manufacturing industry. Information provided must include corporate relationships, contact information (address, phone, email), company size (employment and sales), and financial information such as credit ratings.  This information is needed for the analysis and evaluation of  the effect that MEP delivered services have had on the company as well as to validate the existence of the company and assess the accuracy of the company size and industry code (NAICS) identified with the company business activities. Data must be current and establishments not in the database need to be added if they are not currently listed and a process for validating and modifying NAICS codes should be available to quickly add clients and correct NAICS codes if needed.

VI. SCOPE OF WORK
NIST MEP is seeking detailed data on U.S. based establishments (and Puerto Rico), primarily small and medium-sized establishments, in the manufacturing industry. Information provided must include corporate relationships, contact information (address, phone, email), company size (employment and sales), and financial information such as credit ratings. This information is needed for the analysis and evaluation of  the effect that MEP delivered services have had on the company as well as to validate the existence of the company and assess the accuracy of the company size and industry code (NAICS) identified with the company business activities. Data must be current and establishments not in the database need to be added if they are not currently listed and a process for validating and modifying NAICS codes should be available to quickly add clients and correct NAICS codes if needed.
VII. SPECIFIC TASKS
Access to data shall be provided by using one of several modes 
	Through subscription to media (for example, CDs or downloadable files) that NIST MEP can load and use at its own facilities. No network connectivity to the vendor's system is necessary in this case. If a proprietary data format is utilized in response to this request appropriate data base search and query software must be included. Formats should be fully explained and documented and information on updates must be provided. 
	Through accessing vendor's databases and related application using remote clients (for example, a Web browser or proprietary client that can be installed on users' personal computers with authorized accounts). A network connection is required to the vendor's system in this case. Access to data stored already in vendor's information system must be provided at minimum during normal business hours (between the hours of 8:00AM and 9:00PM eastern standard time, Monday through Friday).
	Through an Application Programming Interface (API) to the vendor's system. This approach should allow MEP for (1) creating and using its own interface to access vendor's data and (2) tight integration of data and services provided by the vendor with MEP's own information system (for example, while processing submitted to MEP is information about client, MEP would be able to validate immediately the industry code submitted with client data). Ideally, such offering should rely on widely used technologies such as Web Services.
	Custom requests for data not readily available (that may require additional analysis and processing by the vendor itself (for example, a request to establish a unique id that may not exist currently). Such service can be made available though traditional methods of communicating (for example, email or phone) and must be provided within 2 business days of submission of the request.   In addition, NIST MEP also seeks to have the vendor respond to requests to validate and/or assign a manufacturing NAICS code to a firm that is not currently classified as such if data and information would support such an assignment. 
VIII. Detailed Requirements
	The following data must be provided by the proposed vendor system  (Unique ID  at the establishment level known to both the company and the proposed vendor,company name (or other trade names), address, phone, email, fax, FIPS, Company Executive names, annual sales, employee levels, and year established).  
	Automatic check and validation of company data submitted to MEPs proprietary information system (MEIS) will include company existence, location, size and NAICS code (one of many possibly NAICS codes identified for the client).
	MEP will need to process at least 20,000 of these validation checks in a year since clients may be submitted more than once in a year.
Ad hoc queries to the vendor database will target researching industry, geographical, corporate and trends up to 100,000 records annually.
	The vendor must be able to provide unique IDs and a company profile known to the company, the proposed vendor, and MEP Center in a timely manner (within 2 business days). Timeliness is very important to ensure that MEP Centers are able to efficiently submit client and project data to MEP. Also, the process of how often data are updated to reflect changes needs to be highlighted. 
	Requests for unique ids/ company profile may come from the client and/or the MEP Center.    
	Licenses to access the proposed vendor database will be purchased by NIST MEP and will be distributed to various users at our 59 centers throughout the US and Puerto Rico. At a minimum, MEP requires 100 licenses/accounts for access with at least 10 simultaneous users.
	As part of the vendor proposal, the vendor must provide a detailed description of how accounts will be distributed and maintained including vendor contact information for support (password changes, browser compatibility issues, etc).
	As part of the vendor proposal, the vendor must provide a detailed description of all data items provided including a description and field length.
	As part of the vendor proposal, the vendor must provide a description of possible technologies to be used by MEP to validate data submitted to MEPs database against data provided by the vendor database.
	As part of the vendor proposal, the vendor must provide an overview of the work flow depicting how the vendors process to handle instances where a unique id/company profile and NAICS code assignment needs to be made or investigated.
	As part of the vendor proposal, the vendor must provide detailed information as to how information is gathered by the vendor and maintained to ensure accuracy and currency.
	As part of the vendor proposal, the vendor must provide detailed information for licenses (number/cost), queries (standard/adhoc), system/database integration, other incidental costs and any volume discounts. 
	Provide training and technical assistance to NIST MEP and centers in terms of how the databases can be used through webinars and other training formats, how investigations into assigning a unique ID, NAICS code, or modifying NAICS codes will be handled.  
	In addition, the vendor should identify the processes used to validate data collected and how often the data are refreshed and revised.

<DESC>Purpose of this Announcement: This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses;  8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.  This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees or less.

Background and Project Requirements: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) seeks to acquire valid and reliable data from a cohort of women with a history of gestational diabetes to:  
1).Investigate the role of genetic variants important for glucose homeostasis in the progression of gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes; 2)To quantify the role of selected environmental factors (e.g., body weight and weight history characteristics, dietary factors, or physical activity) in the progression of gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes; 3)To assess the interactions of genetic and environmental factors in the progression of gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes; and 4)To identify biochemical markers (in blood, urine, or toenails) for type 2 diabetes and for subsequent use in predicting the development of type 2 diabetes among women with a history of gestational diabetes.  A secondary goal of this study is to obtain baseline data on the children born from a pregnancy complicated by GDM and evaluate the feasibility of studying their long-term health conditions, possibly by establishing a new cohort comprising offspring. 
To achieve these goals, the offeror shall identify a historical cohort of 2,500-5,000 women with a history of gestational diabetes who have been followed for a minimum of 10 years after the index pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes or for whom there are updated medical data available for the 10 or more years after the index pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes.  Existing data for cohort members during the historical follow-up should at least include information on the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and related co-morbidities, time of the diagnosis, medical history, reproductive history, and anthropometric characteristics before type 2 diabetes developed in the years after the index pregnancy.  Women with pre-gestational diabetes and evidence suggestive of undiagnosed diabetes before the index pregnancy (i.e. women diagnosed with diabetes within one year following a diagnosis of gestational diabetes are often regarded as having had undiagnosed diabetes prior to pregnancy.) are not eligible for the cohort.  After the cohort of women were identified, they will be re-contacted, recruited, and evaluated at recruitment and followed for a minimum of an additional four years (i.e. active follow-up).  Data collection for the prospective component (i.e. active follow-up) of this retrospective cohort design includes: 1) completion of self-administered questionnaires to collect information including, but not limited to, detailed medical and reproductive factors, socio-economic status, diet, physical activity, lifestyle and behavior factors annually; 2) anthropometric assessment using a standardized protocol annually, and 3) collection of timed bio-specimens including blood, urine, toenails, and other types of media as may be defined in the protocol at baseline and the end of follow-up.  Minimal requirements for the processing of blood specimens include separation of plasma and serum, isolation of buffy coat, and red blood cells.  Type 2 diabetes diagnosis (identified either during the historical follow-up or active follow-up) must be validated by clinical information (i.e. medication, blood glucose levels, etc.) and/or biochemical assays subject to finalization of the protocols.  Newly collected data will be appended to the relevant existing data for the creation of a new database needed for answering the studys research questions. 

Anticipated Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance is five years from September 2010 to September 2015.

Capability Statement/Information: The NICHD is seeking Small Businesses capable of meeting the following criteria.  Small Business organizations must submit Capability Statements in response to this notice and these will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: 1. Accessibility to the study populations as supported by the following evidence. a) Documented evidence of capacity of identifying and recruiting at least 2,500 and up to 5,000 women with a history of gestational diabetes for a minimum of 10 years before the enrollment into the present study to address study questions. b) Documented past and current and anticipated future number of type 2 diabetes events in the targeted population by years after the index pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes to demonstrate the capacity of having at least 1,000 type 2 diabetes events by the end of the contract.  Moreover, among the approximately 1,000 type 2 diabetes cases, evidence should be provided that a minimum of 200 women as incident cases can be identified during the 4-year active follow-up.  A higher proportion of incident type 2 diabetes cases is desirable. c). Documented validated data or documented evidence of capacities to validate the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and co-morbidities (e.g. hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular diseases, etc.), and time of diagnosis of these events in the years after the index pregnancy during the historical follow-up. 2. Availability of data resources and adequacy of the offerors data resources for major exposures in the historical follow-up to address research questions, in particular, the role of gene-environment interactions. Documented evidence of the availability and complexity of data on major environmental and modifiable factors that have been significantly related to the risk of type 2 diabetes, in the years after the index pregnancy during the historical follow-up (i.e. body weight characteristics, dietary factors, physical activity status).  These factors are crucial for the investigation of gene-environment interactions. Evaluation will also be made based on documented evidence regarding how these data were validated and how comprehensive the dietary and physical activity measurements are in characterizing study participants habitual lifestyle before type 2 diabetes developed.  3. Qualifications of offeror, personnel and expertise. a). Demonstrated relevant qualifications, capabilities and experience of the investigators, research staff, and the research organization in successfully conducting and coordinating large longitudinal studies with long-term follow-up including the recruitment and retention of study participants, collection and processing of data, in particular medical, dietary, and lifestyle data and management of large numbers of biological specimen.  These shall be documented by a full CurriculumVitae for the Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators, and other key research personnel, biographical sketches for all other named study staff, and position descriptions for personnel not yet designated for the study. b) Documented prior experience and/or research expertise in the conduct of genetic and/or molecular epidemiologic studies, which are helpful for participation in protocol development and sampling design and oversight of the study.  Such expertise and/or experience can be demonstrated in a number of ways, that is, as measured by education, relevant peer-reviewed publications, funded grants or contracts, etc.. Experience in diabetes research is desirable, but not required. c). Ability to recruit and train research staff for recruitment, data collection and bio-specimen processing. 4. Understanding project requirements and ability to retain.  The offeror should show adequacy of the offerors demonstrated ability and adequate strategy and personnel to a)recognize the complexities in identifying and recruiting eligible study participants with required data available in the past years after the index pregnancy, prospectively following them up for additional years or linking their data with other available health database, and collecting baseline data on the children born from a pregnancy complicated by GDM to evaluate the feasibility of studying long-term health conditions of the children; b)follow up study participants in longitudinal and long-term studies with minimal loss- to-follow-up and collect, process, store, and ship bio-specimens (blood, urine, and toenails) per protocol; c) employ adequate facilities and equipment for data and specimen collection and storage and other aspects of the study.  5.  An understanding of adherence to Federal regulations pertaining to human research, and requirements for security and confidentiality of research records, as documented by reporting to a responsible IRB.

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.
<p>Background. The CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study was awarded in September 2002, under contract N01MH22005, to the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) to examine the presentation and predictors of neurologic complications of HIV in the era of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). In addition to this primary objective of the contract, UCSD has established, characterized, and stored samples from the CHARTER patient cohort and made them available to scientists conducting HIV-related central and peripheral nervous system studies. The program has accumulated invaluable clinical and research data on approximately 1,600 participants and longitudinal data has been collected on a subset of 600 participants.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The goal of the new CHARTER Resource contract is to further utilize and expand the data and specimens collected beyond the original contract period, to serve as a resource to the broader NeuroAIDS research community. This collection will be an ongoing and is an important resource that has been requested by NeuroAIDS research investigators as they continue to study the pathophysiology of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). If a follow-on study to CHARTER is approved by the NIH, new samples and data will be added to the collection over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. The key work to be continued includes:</p>
<p>1) Enhancement of the web-based communication suite, publications tracking system, and imaging utility in place at UCSD under the current contract;</p>
<p>2) Development of a system for collecting data generated from ancillary investigations and a mechanism for "freezing" digital datasets which are used for analyses and publications;</p>
<p>3) Providing scientific investigators access to all stored clinical samples that have been collected under the current contract, and samples that will be accumulated under the follow-on contract, if approved;</p>
<p>4) Establishment and maintenance of a scientific review system to determine whether exhaustible clinical samples should be sent to ancillary research investigators;</p>
<p>5) Providing other specialized services, such as assays or complex data analyses, possibly on a re-charge basis such that the requestor pays actual cost for services rendered;</p>
<p>6) Providing expert advice in the form of interpretation of results, analyses planning, assays, project design, and collaboration with Resource Specialists from each core to assist investigators with complex data and/or sample requests;</p>
<p>7) Reporting on structured feedback and indicators of the CHARTER Resource program success.</p>

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement. <br />
<p><br /><strong>Background.</strong> The CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study was awarded in September 2002, under contract N01MH22005, to the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) to examine the presentation and predictors of neurologic complications of HIV in the era of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). In addition to this primary objective of the contract, UCSD has established, characterized, and stored samples from the CHARTER patient cohort and made them available to scientists conducting HIV-related central and peripheral nervous system studies. The program has accumulated invaluable clinical and research data on approximately 1,600 participants and longitudinal data has been collected on a subset of 600 participants.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong> The goal of the new CHARTER Resource contract is to further utilize and expand the data and specimens collected beyond the original contract period, to serve as a resource to the broader NeuroAIDS research community. This collection will be an ongoing and important resource that has been requested by NeuroAIDS research investigators as they continue to study the pathophysiology of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). If a follow-on study to CHARTER is approved by the NIH, new samples and data will be added to the collection over the next 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements.</strong> The key work to be continued includes:</p>
<p>1) Enhancement of the web-based communication suite, publications tracking system, and imaging utility in place at UCSD under the current contract;</p>
<p>2) Development of a system for collecting data generated from ancillary investigations and a mechanism for "freezing" digital datasets which are used for analyses and publications;</p>
<p>3) Providing scientific investigators access to all stored clinical samples that have been collected under the current contract, and samples that will be accumulated under the follow-on contract, if approved;</p>
<p>4) Establishment and maintenance of a scientific review system to determine whether exhaustible clinical samples should be sent to ancillary research investigators;</p>
<p>5) Providing other specialized services, such as assays or complex data analyses, possibly on a re-charge basis such that the requestor pays actual cost for services rendered;</p>
<p>6) Providing expert advice in the form of interpretation of results, analyses planning, assays, project design, and collaboration with Resource Specialists from each core to assist investigators with complex data and/or sample requests; <br />7) Reporting on structured feedback and indicators of the CHARTER Resource program success.</p>
<p><strong>Other important considerations.</strong> In order to perform this work, qualified sources <strong>MUST</strong> have:</p>
<p>1) Access to the resources collected and developed under Contract N01MH22005, including clinical samples and databases; <br />2) Access to CHARTER subjects for a follow-on initiative, to continue collection of samples and data;<br />3) Expertise in neuromedical, neurobehavioral, neuroimaging and virology.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance.</strong> The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement.</strong> Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should describe (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information (f) any other resources available to support this project.</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this notice. There will not be a solicitation, specifications or drawings available at this time.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC MIDLANT) is seeking Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform the proposed contracts. 
NAVFAC MIDLANT anticipates awarding a Multiple Award Contract(s) for Remedial Action Construction (RAC), Remedial Action Operations (RAO), and Long Term Management (LTM) for projects within the Hampton Roads Integrated Product Team (HRIPT) Area of Responsibility (AOR), located in the State of Virginia. The AOR for this requirement include the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg, and Yorktown. The contract will be awarded to a maximum of five (5) contractors. The contract will be for a five year duration: base year plus four option years, with an estimated contract value of $50,000,000.
General Work Requirements: 
The Contractor shall provide the personnel, tools, equipment, materials, transportation, and management to perform Remedial Action Construction, Remedial Action Operations, and/or Long Term Management services as required and negotiated in each individual task order. 
Remedial Action Construction (RAC) is the phase of the CERCLA process where the site remedy is constructed either as an interim or final action. This phase may include the construction of various soil, sediment and/or groundwater remediation systems that function as containment (e.g. soil cover, RCRA cap, slurry wall, pump & treat systems); in-situ treatment (e.g.natural attenuation, soil vapor extraction, enhanced bio-remediation, air sparging) or ex-site treatment (air stripping, constructed wetlands, off site disposal, stabilization, solidification).
Remedial Action Operations (RAO) is the phase of the CERCLA process when the remediation system (possibly constructed under the RAC phase noted above) is in place and is operating, or the chemical or biological processes are occurring leading to the cleanup objective. RAO may include active remediation, monitoring, operation, and optimization for extended periods of time to reduce contaminants to site cleanup standards; along with implementation & management/maintenance of Land Use Controls (LUCs). 
Long Term Management (LTM) occurs when the selected remedy has achieved the cleanup goals (possibly done under the RAC or RAO phase noted above), and hazardous substances remain at the site above levels that would allow unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. LTM may include long term monitoring, implementation and/or management of land use controls (LUCs), maintenance of the final remedy, and preparation of five year reviews. 
In addition to performance of the specific services listed above, the contractor will generally be responsible for maintaining records and preparation of written documents such as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan modifications, work plans, health & safety plans, sampling and analysis plans (SAP), and waste management plans connected with such services. The contractor may also be required to provide proposed solutions to technical problems and optimization. The work also includes performing indefinite quantity work such as maintenance, repair, and /or construction directed by the Contracting Officer via issued Task Orders.
Proposed Contract Task Order (CTO) ordering procedures: 
Each CTO will be initially awarded on a "fair opportunity" basis as outlined in FAR 16.505. Because the initial contracts will be awarded through a rigorous Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) process, we intend to make maximum use of the latitude allowed by the FAR to streamline CTO awards. Typically, only price and past performance will be considered. When required, we will maintain the ability to employ more rigorous evaluation criteria for CTO awards.
Follow-on CTOs will be ordered as an "exception to the fair opportunity process" as outlined in FAR 16.505. Because O&M/Long Term Monitoring (LTM) requires consistent management, it would be impractical to re-compete each CTO at its completion. Each awardee will have a fair opportunity to be considered for the original orders; however, we will attempt to negotiate subsequent follow-on CTOs on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency. If we are unable to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, we will reserve the right to compete the follow-on work on a "fair opportunity" basis to all contract awardees.
The range for individual task orders $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.
All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to respond. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone Small Business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement. If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals. All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The Government anticipates a contract award for these contracts in September 2010. The appropriate NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.
It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package not to exceed 5 pages. This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:
(1) Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated. Knowledge of the state regulations within the AOR. Indicate whether your firm worked as a prime or subcontractor, contract value, brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the work described, and a Government / Agency point of contact.
(2) Company profile, to include number of offices and number of employees per office, annual receipts, office location(s), available bonding capacity in excess of $16,000,000 per contract, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
(3) Please indicate if you are an 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, and Veteran Owned.
(4) In order to assist us in determining the geographic boundaries of the contract(s) necessary to cover the services of the proposed requirement within our AOR, please identify the geographic area in which you can operate in an efficient and economical manner.
The capabilities package for this sources sought notice is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing, or developed, expertise and experience in relation to this contract. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the capabilities package. Submission of a capabilities package is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. 
Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall be mailed to the following address: 
Commander NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic, HR IPT, 9324 Virginia Ave., Bldg. Z140, 1st Floor, Room 117 Attn: Patricia Lathan Norfolk, VA 23511-3689.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) requirement to provide a Collaborative Learning Model for the Patient-Centered Medical Home Collaborative (PCMHC).  This involves face-to-face sessions and requires involvement of improvement teams. Involves activities such as identifying team members, gathering and analyzing relevant data, developing Aim (measurable goal)  statements, and potentially other actions related to the improvement work such as flow mapping the process, identifying areas of constraint, measuring demand for a service, measuring supply for a service, etc.  This PCMHC is a comprehensive collaborative that focuses on a redesign of the healthcare delivery process, focusing on the patient as the center.  It requires knowledge of Access and flow principles such as balancing supply & demand, Queuing Theory, Theory of constraints and other principles that relate to flow of patients through the continuum of care in the VHA healthcare system.

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) Program Office, intends to release a solicitation to acquire additional Satellites and ground stations for the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) program to the incumbent contractor, Boeing Satellite Systems, Inc., 2260 Imperial Hwy, El Segundo, CA 90245-3501. The period of performance for this sole-source contract will be from July 2010 - September 2022. Classification code 18, identified at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, applies.</p>
<p>The original WGS contract was competitively awarded to Boeing Satellite Systems in Jan 2001. The purpose of the contract was for the development and production of one satellite with options for satellites 2 through 6 and the associated ground control segments, Global SATCOM Configuration Control Elements (GSCCE). The options for satellites 2 &amp; 3 and GSCCEs were exercised. The funding required to exercise the remaining satellite options was not available prior to the option "exercise no-later-than dates" and subsequently, the options expired. A second WGS contract was awarded sole source to BSS in Feb 2006; this contract was for production and launch of satellites 4-6. As part of the Fiscal Years 2010-2015 Program Decision Memorandum (PDM) III, the Air Force was directed to procure additional WGS satellites to support and maintain an eight-satellite constellation and to begin launching in FY15. Under the contemplated contract, BSS will provide non-recurring engineering and long-lead hardware for satellite 7. The contract will also include priced options for the production and launch of satellite 7 as well as advanced procurement, production and launch for satellites 8-12 based on producing one satellite per year.</p>

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services, Portland, Oregon intends to award using other than full and open competition to Floy Tag and Mfg Inc., Seattle, WA  according to FAR 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Completion procedures.  This acquisition is required to support the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery, Gardnerville, Nevada for fish tagging operations.   FloyTag & Mfg. is the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.
The requirement is to procure 300,000 (green) fine fabric anchor tags.  These fabric tags are specifically designed to prevent harm to fish species and durable enough to remain on the fish for its lifespan. It is necessary to use the same type of tags as prior years so that there is consistency with the scientific data recorded from captured fish. It is necessary to have green tags for this particular order as the color corresponds with where the fish are released into the wild.  Different release areas have different color tags.  Tags are numbered consecutively on one side and a listed phone number on the other side. 
This is not a request for quotes and no written solicitation will be issued. Nevertheless, any firm that is capable of meeting the requirements described herein may submit a response not later than close of business on 2/11/2010.  Response to this posting must be submitted in writing via email.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Linda Askew at linda_askew@fws.gov

<DESC>Contract No. 70181AM083
TAS: 14 16620000
United States Department of the InteriorJustification of Other than Full and Open Competition Under $25,000
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.A division within the Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska Region recently experienced a leadership change. Because of this change, it is imperative some team building exercises are provided for the staff, as it faces time without a permanent leader. The office has not had such training in many years and over the last year has experience significant personnel and personal challenges within the office.  It is imperative that the office function effectively going forward and that personnel work as a team to accomplish the agency's mission.  
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition.  Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title.  FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). This purchase will allow work already commenced to continue, as the need for team building is immediate. Delaying an award of a purchase order would jeopardize progress already made, causing further harm to the staff.  
Initially, The Growth Company was contacted to provide initial interviews and the team building exercises. After holding the initial interviews and the first session, the contractor indicated that the challenges were more significant than initially outlined and subsequently she suggested that she will not be able to successfully intervene and stay within the original budget of $2,500. This revelation was unanticipated. In order to continue progress and the services, additional funds are required. Since the challenge is more than initially anticipated and it is imperative that we do what is necessary to create a fully functioning team, we must establish a contract with The Growth Company.
Engaging with a different vendor will incur additional costs and risks to the government.  Initially, bringing a new vendor would require scheduling individuals so they can assess the issues that must be addressed.  This will take time and cause confusion and concern among staff because of having to be interviewed again.  Since some of the issues are sensitive, there could be confidentiality issues because we are expanding the circle of individuals' knowledgeable of the situation.  The new vendor would have to start anew, establishing a rapport and trust with the group before progress could be made.  Essentially, the investment made thus far may be compromised and destined to be redone.   There would also likely be additional emotional stress among the staff of the organization that would only hinder the team building that is necessary.   
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical.  Recognizing the need to initiate the team building efforts quickly, I solicited information from potential vendors from the USFWS, Alaska Region's Diversity and Civil Rights Office. They provided the names of two Anchorage vendors that they were familiar with that had experience in conflict resolution/team building initiatives, Wordwright LLC and The Growth Company.  In an effort to expedite the process, each vendor was called and provided with a description and nature of the work. Upon discussing the matter, under the micropurchase threshold limitations, The Growth Company was selected based on their approach of an initial 3-hour session to set the stage and start to implement strategies to enhance teamwork.  Several weeks later they would schedule a second 3-hour team building session and check-in with folks to see whether progress was being made. Wordwright indicated they would follow-up the interviews with one 8-hour team building session that they thought would start the process of team building, which was not seen as beneficial for the situation at hand. 
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. Based upon the efforts cited above no market survey was anticipated, or necessary, when this effort was initiated.  Only after we initiated the intervention did it come to light that the effort would be more complicated than originally envisioned. As such, to ensure progress and confidentiality are not compromised, it is in the Government's best interest to continue with a contract with The Growth Company. All steps to remove or overcome barriers to competition have been taken.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, FL intends to increase the ceiling on contract N65886-07-D-0001 with Tyonek Services Corporation. This increase is necessary due to continued escalation in work due to the Global War on Terror efforts and will allow for uninterrupted performance until a follow-on contract can be awarded. The contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Time and Material Provisions for support services to augment the Government workforce performing Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) work on aircraft and rework of associated components/materials. The current ceiling price will be exhausted in August 2010. This increase will cover a period of 2 months until the follow on contract is awarded in October 2010. Therefore, the requirement being synopsized here would be a 4 months effort when including the 2 months mobilization needed for a new contractor to assume the work. This sole source action is being requested in order for the FRCSE to have uninterrupted services until the recompeted contract is awarded.

Any firms believing they can provide these services may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. It must clearly show the firm's ability to be responsive without compromising the quality, accuracy or reliability of the services provided and without causing an interruption of critical services. The firms response should also illustrate how it can overcome the start-up costs necessary to assume this effort in the short period of performance that this synopsis represents.

The contract was originally solicited as a competitive procurement action pursuant to Section 8(a), of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637 (a)) and FAR 19.805. The NAICS Code is 336413 and the FSC/PSC Code is J015.
The procurement was a 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms whose numbers of employees did not exceed 1000. 

If firms are interested in the follow-on effort, a Sources Sought was completed on 29 June 2009 and the synopsis for this effort is expected to be published in March 2010. The resultant contract will be set-aside for an 8 (a) Small Business.

<CONTACT>Herbert B. Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-883-0180, Fax 850-883-0543, Email Herbert.Hill@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Control Section Modification (HCSM) limited production units and the full rate production (FRP) Lot 1 and Lot 2 options. The 693rd Armament Systems Squadron (693 ARSS), 328th Armament Systems Group (328 ARSG), 308th Armament Systems Wing (308 ARSW), Eglin AFB, FL plans to award two sole source limited production contracts. The limited production contracts call for the contractors to produce modified HARM control sections that: (a) add a Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance capability, (b) increase the current control section Inertial Navigation Set (INS) accuracy, and (c) restructure the current AGM-88C seeker software to migrate the guidance function from the seeker to the control section. The modified control sections must meet the requirements of Weapon System Specification 2261672, dated September 18, 2006; Missile Prime Item Development Specification 2261673, dated September 18, 2006; and the Control Section Prime Item Development Specification 2261674, dated September 18, 2006, while maintaining the missile interface as defined by AS-5186C, dated April 8, 2003, and AS5108D-C, dated August 10, 2001. The HARM with a modified control section will be employed on the F-16 Block 50/52 aircraft utilizing the current LAU-118 launcher, which includes the Aircraft Launcher Interface Computer (ALIC). No modifications to the aircraft or ALIC hardware and software will be allowed. The contractors will be required to utilize existing Field Level Support Equipment without modification. Under the limited production contracts, the contractors will be required to deliver two engineering evaluation units (one 6 months after award and the other 10 months after award) and five modified HARM control sections for performance verification (12 months after award) and the test support and data analysis during the six-month performance verification period. The limited-production contracts also contain options for two production lots, with not-to-exceed pricing for a quantity range of control sections, warranty and special tooling and test equipment. <br />
<p><br />The Government anticipates awarding the FRP options based on a limited competition between the two contractors utilizing Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection procedures after performance verification is complete. The total number of modified HARM control sections the Government will purchase under the two FRP lots is approximately 500. The Government's intent is to purchase as many as the budget allows. Inasmuch as Raytheon and Alliant Techsystems, Inc (ATK) are currently performing work on the HARM, the Government will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment to any prospective new source. Therefore, the fulfillment of the supplies listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture. Anticipated date of the RFP for limited production is on or about 15 Dec 09; date of closing response is on or about 15 Feb 10.</p>
<p>This acquisition is contemplated under the authority of Title 10, United States Code 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources." The limited production contracts will be awarded on a sole source basis and the full rate production options will be awarded on a limited competition basis. The sole source awards are to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems, 9000 S. Rita Road, Bldg 9022, M/S R117, Tucson, AZ 85744 and ATK Mission Systems, Advanced Weapons, 21301 Burbank Blvd, Woodland Hills, CA 91367. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the 693 ARSS.</p>
<p>The date for response to this synopsis for HARM Control Section Modification is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication. Facsimile responses or requests to the Contracting Officer at (850) 883-0543 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt. Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Ms Corletta (Nicky) Wilson, Contract Specialist, (850) 883-0309 or Mr Herbert (Bo) Hill, (850) 883-0180, 693 ARSS/SYKA, 207 West D Ave, Suite 622, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6844.</p>

PURPOSE.  This QASP is a Government developed and applied document used to ensure that the Contractor performs all requirements of the Contract/Order, that the Government receives quality services, and that the Government pays only for services actually provided.  The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish. <BR>2.  SCOPE.  The Contractor is responsible for management and quality control necessary to perform the required services. The QASP provides for the Governments oversight of the Contractors quality control efforts to assure timely, responsive services are provided IAW the Contract/Order. The contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to perform quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. <BR>3.  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.<BR>Contracting Officer (KO): A duly appointed individual with the authority to enter into, administer and terminate contracts on behalf of the Government. Only the KO can legally commit the Government and, as the Governments agent, modify the Contract/Order. The KO is the final authority for determining adequacy of the Contractors performance. KO decisions arising under or relating to the contact are final.  The KO has not appointed a Contracting Officers Representative (COR); the function is retained.   The KO will ensure performance of all necessary services.  A Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) in the requiring activity will support the KO by ensuring services are provided IAW the Contract/Order.  The TPOC must advise the KO of any/all performance deficiencies.<BR> Technical Point of Contact (TPOC): A government employee designated by the requiring activity to provide oversight of the Contractors performance and to accept services on the activitys behalf.  <BR><BR>4.  METHODS OF SURVEILLANCE. Simplified methods of surveillance will be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance. The primary methods of surveillance are periodic assessments of service and/or customer feedback.<BR>Periodic Assessment of Services  Periodic assessment of services will be conducted.  For services which occur over a number of months, the TPOC will evaluate services on a monthly basis and upon completion of the services.<BR>Customer Feedback  Customer feedback is typically obtained via telephone or email.  Telephonic customer complaints must be followed up in writing/email. To be considered valid, the customer complaint must clearly articulate the nature of the complaint, time, date, etc.   The TPOC will investigate the complaint; if determined valid, the TPOC will advise the KO to notify the Contractor of the deficiency.  Copies of valid complaints and the resolution must be retained in the official contract file. <BR><BR>5.  QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) SURVEILLANCE TASKS. <BR>a. The TPOC will evaluate and assess the contractors performance measured against contract performance standards as defined in the PWS, and will ensure all services of the Contract/Order are properly performed.<BR><BR>b. The TPOC will immediately report any noted deficiencies to the KO to include date, type of deficiency, and the KO will request corrective action from the Contractor.  <BR><BR>c.  The TPOC will re-examine services that were found deficient. Failure to complete corrective actions will be reported immediately to the KO for further action.<BR><BR>d.  Upon satisfactory completion of the work, the TPOC will accept the services provided and authorize payment, by approving the Contractors invoice in Wide Area Workflow.<BR> <BR>8.  DOCUMENTATION.  Based on the low dollar value and the low complexity and/or duration of the Contract/Order, documentation will be kept to a minimum. No documentation is expected when services are provided IAW the Contract/Order.  It is not uncommon for a low dollar value and low complexity and/or duration service to be performed without any remedial actions required by the Government.  In such cases, only approval of the invoice is required, signifying satisfactory completion of the Contract/Order. Should performance problems be encountered, documentation is required, to include, notes of surveillance, notification to the Contractor of performance problems, and re-examination/final resolution.  The TPOC must forward any records they maintained to the KO after accepting the Contractors services for use in the event of a future contract claim/dispute<BR><BR><BR>EXECUTIVE LEVEL AGENCY PROTEST<BR><BR>Local Clause 5152.233-4000, AMC-Level Protest Program (Nov 2008)<BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

<DESC>The U.S. Government Ships bunkers Easy Acquisition Card Program (SEA Card) is the Defense Energy Support Centers (DESC) worldwide marine fuel procurement program used by the Department of Defense (DoD) and federal civilian agencies.  SEA Card   is designed to make marine fuel procurement and the resulting payment process more efficient for both vessels and merchants.  The program is based on the SEA Card Order Management System (DoD-SCOMS), a web-based platform which eliminates the need for paper-based processes and can be accessed at https://www.seacardsys.com. 
One feature of the SEA Card program is our Open Market purchase program which allows for marine fuel purchases by the U.S. Government in over twenty-six hundred ports worldwide.  In the event that fuel is requested at a non-contract port, or a merchant is unable to supply against an existing contract in a port, an Open Market purchase can take place.  Registered vessels can use the SEA Card system to create an open market fuel request and input the specification requirements, special terms and conditions for the specific request, and all feasible modes of delivery.  Once a request is established, a competitive quote process in which quotes are submitted by multiple merchants will commence and an award is made to the merchant who submitted the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.   After fueling occurs, merchants input the transactions details into DoD-SCOMS.  The transaction details are then routed to the approving official for approval before processing for payment.  This ensures that the appropriate purchasing policies are followed and purchase details are correct.
There are many benefits of using DESCs Open Market Sea Card system to process orders.  The SEA Card system eliminates paper based processes as all communications regarding an Open Market SEA Card order are electronic.   The SEA Card system provides 24-hour customer support and detailed management reports which DESC customers and participating merchants are entitled to use.   
 
Vendors interested in participating in the program must register with DESC by sending an email to the DESC point of contact below with the following information: Name of Company, Point of Contact, Point of Contact information (i.e. phone, and email address).  
For those merchants who have additional questions about the Open Market SEA Card program please contact the primary point of contact;  Joseph Teye-Kofi, contract specialist at extension 703-767-8496, or via email  Joseph.Teye-Kofi@dla.mil.  The secondary points of contacts are Francis Murphy, Contract Specialist, at extension 703-767-8479, Francis.C.Murphy@dla.mil and Ditu Kasuyi, Contract Officer, at extension 703-767-8495, Ditu.Kasuyi@dla.mil

SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas, is seeking a Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, and incidentals required for tree planting and herbaceous weed control of approximately 455 acres consisting of two (2) sites for the NRCS Texas Wetland Reserve Program (WRP).   All work shall be done in accordance with the Statement of Work Forest Stand Improvement Texas  Bryan Zone, the tree/shrub establishment Statement of Work, the Tree Planting Plan, and the Herbaceous Weed Control for Hardwood Seedlings Bryan Zone Job Sheet  490B.  

BACKGROUND:  Restoration projects on these two (2) sites include the planting of hardwood seedlings and herbaceous weed control.  
 
SCOPE OF WORK:   
1.  Pre-Planting Conference:  A pre-planting conference will be held between the contractor, owner (or his agent) and the NRCS to discuss planting operation.  Planting and Herbaceous Weed Treatment will not begin before this the Pre-Planting Conference. 

2.  Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be machine planted on a 10 X 10 spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 455 acres.  The planting for the area, except for strips around water impoundments, will consist of one mix described in the Tree Planting Plan attachment to this solicitation. 

3.  Species:  Refer to the attached Tree Planting Specifications.  The contractor is responsible for the ordering of the seedlings, their delivery to the site, their care, and, if necessary, cold storage.  The species for 	most of the site are grouped as preferred and secondary.  At least four species will be planted.  Each referred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and secondary species will make up no more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around impoundments.  In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be 	used. 
	
4.  Species Substitution:  If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one.  Contractor must acquire approval from the NRCS for any species substitution.  
	
5.  Spacing and Planting Rate:  Hardwood will be planted on a 10 X 10 spacing (436 seedlings per acre). The number of satisfactory planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 370 seedlings per acre.   Areas along the shores of impoundments and natural slough and wet depressions will be planted with the proper species and to the extend that the water depth will allow.  In these areas, spacing will be increase to 15 X 15.  

6.  Species Mixes:  Mixes will be achieved through bag-mixes and/or matching the species to the site.  Unless otherwise specified in the Tree Planting Plan, row or block plantings of single mixes will be avoided.  Further explanation will be provided at the Pre-Planting Conference. 
	
7. Seedling Quality:  Seedlings will meet the standards listed in the Tree Planting Specifications.  Both the 	contractor and the NRCS will determine quality and count by opening one bag of each species being planted.  It is the contractors responsibility to discuss seedling quality with the NRCS representative to determine the responsibility to cull seedlings according to the standards stated in the Tree Planting Specifications 

8.  Seedling Care:  It is the responsibility of the contractor to assure proper care of the seedlings during the planting operation.  Planting will begin immediately after receiving the seedlings.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to secure cold storage.  Contractor must ensure that only then number of seedlings that can be planted in a day will be taken to the site and will be kept shaded and moist at all times.  

9.  Pruning:  
a.  Roots:  The tap roots may be pruned to a minimum length of 8.  Lateral roots may be pruned to facilitate planting.  Prune by pulling the laterals down along the tap root or cut to its (the taps roots) length.  Pruning will done only with shears or a sharp knife.  All care must be taken to prevent tearing of roots. 

b.  Tops: Tops may be pruned to a minimum height of 16. 

10.  Planting Methods:  Seedlings will be machine planted.  Seedlings will be planted with the root collar slightly below the soil surface.  Roost will be not be balled, twisted or planted in a J or U shaped manner.  Steps needed to ensure the compacting of the soil around the seedling, leaving no air pockets in the planting slit, will be taken.  When optimum site and soil moisture and/or temperature conditions are not available, consult with the NRCS before planting. 

11.  Quality Control:  The Control will be ultimately responsible for quality assurance.  Quality control will be explained during the Pre-Planting Conference.  In addition, NRCS representatives will be available during the first day of planting and will occasionally visit the site during planting.  They will also be available for consultation, but they will not serve as daily inspectors.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide daty-to-day oversight of the planting crews.  NRCS will conduct an inspection at the completion of the planting to determine the acceptability of the planting.   

12.  Herbaceous Weed Control:  Contractor will consult with the NRCS to ensure the proper herbicide is used.  Contractor will acquire approval from the NRCS, beforehand to identify the proper application methods for applying herbicide.   

13.  Environmental Concerns:  herbicides should not be applied within any Streamside Management Zone or any open water.  Some herbicide application rates are tied to soil texture and moisture.  Most have restrictions concerning applying on or near water.  Again, follow the label instructions as well as the Texas Best Management Practice (BMPs).

<span style="COLOR: black">REQUEST FOR PRICE QUOTES</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price Quotes are requested for a one-year renewal support agreement for RealSecure Network software maintenance.</p>
<p>The existing maintenance service expired on 29 October 2009. Price Quotes should include reinstatement fees if applicable.</p>
<p>A justification for specific make and model is listed below.</p>
<p>The part numbers, quantities and estimated costs for this purchase are reflected below: <br /><br />IBM Part # Qty # of Users<br />RNE-1-PB-M 1 13<br />RNE-1-PB-M 1 8</p>
<p>The software maintenance agreement will be initially delivered to the following Fairfax, Virginia location:</p>
<p>Raytheon Inc, H98291 (EBOM 1728)<br />4601 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 711 Attn: Paul Foresta<br />Arlington, VA 22203-1524</p>
<p><br />The purchase of this one-year renewal maintenance support for RealSecure Network software maintenance is needed to support the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System Global Counter-Terrorism Force and Multinational Coalition Forces Iraq (CENTRIX-GCTF/MCFI) services. A justification for specific make and model is attached for reference. This maintenance agreement will provide needed software updates necessary to maintain the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />SPECIFIC MAKE AND MODEL</p>
<p><br />Description of Action(s):</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to purchase a one-year renewal maintenance agreement for RealSecure Network software. This acquisition is in support of Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System Global Counter-Terrorism Force and Multinational Coalition Forces Iraq (CENTRIX-GCTF/MCFI) services. This maintenance agreement will provide needed software updates necessary to maintain the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The products and quantities required for this RealSecure Network software maintenance are:</p>
<p>Part number RNE-1-PB-M, quantity of 1 (includes 13 users) <br /><br />Part number RNE-1-PB-M, quantity of 1 (includes 8 users).</p>
<p>The manufacture of this software is IBM.</p>
<p>Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: The specific make and model required is already accredited in the facility. A change in the product would mean modifying engineering drawings, changing accreditation paperwork and require re-approval from the Designated Approval Authority (DAA), causing a detrimental delay in operation. The specific make and model was tested extensively such that a confidence factor of 100% is assigned to the probability of this product's integration into the over-riding system. The product is required to ensure the timely update of the intrusion detection system's signatures. If the selected specific make and model is not purchased, signatures can not be updated and the latest security threats can not be detected. The purchase of this specific make and model is more economical than purchasing a different brand that would require the system to be retested and approved.</p>
<p>Abandoning this software would significantly increase the cost and time it would take to convert to a new software. Selecting alternative software products would require the PMO to incur a minimum of 12 months of development effort and an estimated additional program cost (excluding new COTS licensing costs) to develop, integrate, test, secure, and maintain a replacement for this software.</p>

(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
6.302-1 (2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  Requirement shall be posted Brand, Model and Specifications Specific, there is no restriction on the selection of vendors.

(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  
Many of the requested items are available on GSA schedules.  For those items not available from GSA schedules, market research using the internet has identified the most economical sources. 

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
Technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work and purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition are not available because the CFE is called out in the COR and the hardware and software required by the DISA application is dictated by the DISA.

(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
Many of the requested items are available on GSA schedules.  For those on the GSA schedules, Internet searches have been conducted and the most economical one found has been listed.  Have any sources written to be included in this purchase? I believe we have initiated all communications. This may be a No answer. 

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
None required.  Any current vendor that can meet the specific brand name, model, and specifications called out in the FRC COR is acceptable.

(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 
(a)  The requirement to purchase precise brand, model, and specification equipment for development of GFI for installation on CFE is valid.  This requirement restricts competition to those vendors capable of providing the exact equipment specified but does not prohibit competition between similar vendors.

(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel. 
The FRC COR requirement has been certified and accepted by the Coast Guard Acquisitions directorate, CG-9; as the specifications and performance standards for the Fast Response Cutter.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-851)<br />2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-267-2285<br />Fax: 202-267-4011</p>

This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), for a firm fixed type contract. The Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC/PKEA) at Tinker Air Force Base Oklahoma intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (best value).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Number of Contracts to be Awarded <br />The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals/quotes and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal/quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>

<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s).

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Questions and Answers:

1.  I printed the maps of the area but it doesn't have a scale.

The Project location map is not to scale it is meant to provide location of sites in relation to the road system.  

2.  I need to know how far apart the tanks are?

Tanks are located within the San Bernardino National Forest.  Distance between the two farthest sites is 95 miles (Mormon Rocks Station to Keenwild Station). The reminder of the sites within that distance.

3.  How much sediment is expected?

Half inch to one inch.

4.  How much water can be pumped into the tanks per minute? This question is very important if the walls are covered in sediment. If you can't pump at least 150 gallons per minute into your tanks you will run out of water before we can clean all the walls.

Most of these sites are low flow systems and they vary from 5-40 gal. per minute.

<p>Title: Education Services for the Exhibition Program at the National Library of Medicine's History of Medicine Division (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/index.html).<br /><br />A. Background Information<br />The Exhibition Program of the National Library of Medicine presents lively and informative exhibitions that enhance the public and scholarly awareness and appreciation of the National Library of Medicine's collections. The exhibitions cover a wide range of topics, reflecting the Program staff's scholarly research in science, medicine, technology, and history.</p>
<p>The Program creates two types of exhibitions-major exhibitions for onsite display at the Library and banner-style traveling exhibitions. The onsite exhibition occupies 4000 sq ft of space and contains artifact, graphics, and multimedia elements, similar to museum displays. The traveling exhibitions consist of six 2'X6' banners that provide flexible display options at host sites. The current major exhibition on display is "Against the Odds: Making a Different in Global Health." The list of the banner exhibitions currently on travel is available at the "Traveling Exhibitions" web page (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/travelingexhibitions.html).<br /><br />B. Purpose and Objectives:<br />The Exhibition Program requires education services from a K-12 curriculum/instructional expert to develop education resources related to its exhibitions. The education expert will also be able to present in an online environment and promote those resources to professional audiences. <br /><br />C. Scope of Work:<br />The Exhibition Program develops companion web sites-i.e., online exhibitions-in conjunction with both major and banner exhibitions.

<p>The vendor, as a active practitioner in museum and/or K-12 education communities, will be qualified to aid in the Program's outreach to those communities by reviewing existing online education resources and developing a reconfiguration plan that promotes ease of access and use of the resources by targeted audiences-i.e., educators. In addition, the vendor will be capable of developing an outreach plan for enhancing awareness and recognition of our education resources among education professionals in K-12, higher education, and other cultural/scholarly institutions.<br /><br />D.

This is an ammendment issued to this combined synopsis/solicitation to modify the response date based on receipt of un-conforming bids by qualified vendors.   Please note amplifiying information found in paragraph 1.6 of the attached Statement of Work and updated primary and secondary points of contact for inquiries and bid submissions.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number H92257-10-Q-0004 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 200538 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20091229.  The proposed acquisition is restricted to total small businesses. The associated NAICS code is 314999 with a standard business size of 500 Employees. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated.  Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure:  

CLIN 0001: Flame-Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) Suits
 
This requirement is for the supplies for Flame-Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) Suits
to be delivered as soon as possible but no later than 30 days ARO.  The contractor shall provide all FROG suits according to the Statement of Work (SOW) attached (Size and quantity are included in the SOW).  

Delivery Locations: Camp Lejeune, NC and Camp Pendleton, CA

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are technical capability, delivery and price. The Government intends to make award based on best value. Best value means the expected outcome of the acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of offers, received.

<DESC><p>This acquisition is to provide cost-effective C4I and Munitions test support for the 46th Test Wing's Range Group Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.&nbsp;<br /><br />CIMTIC III will&nbsp;provide for urgent development and modification of AAC C4I and munitions test and evaluation (T&amp;E) systems and facilities under the responsibility of the 46th Test Wing's Range Group. The contract is intended to meet customer test requirements that cannot be timely met by a separate procurement action. The capabilities for rapid response, surge capacity and flexibility to unforeseen events are critical requirements to meet the short lead-time and dynamic test requirements inherent in the testing of modern weapon systems and rapidly changing defensive technologies and tactics. In support of this objective a high level of technical expertise is required in system analysis, system engineering, and in particular, continuous participation in the technological evolution of C4I, munitions, directed energy (DE), and other T&amp;E systems, facilities, and infrastructures necessary to keep pace with corresponding technological advances in advanced state-of-the-art C4I, smart munitions, surveillance, reconnaissance, and Electronic Combat (EC) systems as required to satisfy future AAC customer needs and requirements. In addition, this contract will provide AAC with T&amp;E systems, facilities, and infrastructure which support the implementation and realization of the C4I Test Process (AF Manual 99-111), Munitions Test Process (AF Manual 99-104), and EC Test Process (AF Manual 99-112). Thus, this contract will support development/ modification/upgrades to digital simulation models (DSMs), hardware in-the-loop (HITL) test facilities, measurement facilities, installed system test facilities (ISTFs), open-air range (OAR) facilities, and networked test facilities. Other areas requiring a high level of technical expertise include test engineering and analysis; test support hardware and software design, development, modification, fabrication, calibration, and integration and test transition support for sub-systems/systems/test facilities/infrastructure/networks, and supportability planning, installation, and training.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 1 to DARPA-BAA-10-20 Deep Sea Operations (DSOP) is to make the following changes to the solicitation and provide answers to questions received at the Proposer's Day conference 19 January 2010.
<p>1. Section 5.1 Evaluation Criteria is replaced in its entirety with the following:</p>
<p>5.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific/technical review of each proposal using the following criteria: (a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit; (b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; (c) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition; (d) Proposers Capabilities and Related Experience; (e) Cost Realism and Schedule. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons. The following are descriptions of the evaluation criteria in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>5.1.1 Overall Scientific and Technical Merit</p>
<p>The proposed technical approach is feasible, achievable, complete and supported by a proposed technical team that has the expertise and experience to lead and to accomplish the proposed tasks. Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final product that achieves the goal can be expected as a result of award. The proposal clearly identifies major technical risks and clearly defines feasible planned mitigation strategies and efforts to address those risks. The proposal clearly explains the technical approach(es) that will be employed to meet or exceed each program goal and system metric listed in Section 1.2. and provides ample justification as to why the approach(es) is / are feasible. Other factors to be considered will include the structure, clarity, and responsiveness of the statement of work; the quality of proposed deliverables; and the linkage of the statement of work, technical approach(es), risk mitigation plans, costs, and deliverables of the prime contractor and all subcontractors through a logical, well structured, and traceable technical plan.<br />5.1.2 Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission<br />The potential unique contributions of the proposed effort to the national technology base will be evaluated. Specifically, relevance to DARPA's mission to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their application.<br />5.1.3 Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition <br />The objective of this criterion is to establish that the capability and plans to transition or to expedite the transition of the technologies and products resulting from this program to the program(s) of record or to the operational military community is reasonable and achievable for the technology(ies) being developed.<br />5.1.4 Proposer's Capabilities and Related Experience<br />The proposer's prior experience in similar efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to deliver products that meet the proposed technical performance within the proposed budget and schedule. The proposed team has the expertise to manage the cost and schedule. Similar efforts completed/ongoing by the proposer and by key members of the proposed team in this area are fully described including identification of other Government sponsors. Further, on any cited similar efforts, the proposer shall provide the Government an assessment of performance, including the team's ability to control technical, cost, and schedule against what was originally proposed.<br />5.1.5 Cost Realism and Schedule<br />The objective of this criterion is to establish that the proposed costs and schedule are realistic for the technical and management approach offered, as well as to determine the proposer's practical understanding of the effort. The proposal will be reviewed to determine if the costs and schedule proposed are based on realistic assumptions, reflect a sufficient understanding of the technical goals and objectives of the BAA, and are consistent with the proposer's technical approach (to include the proposed Statement of Work). At a minimum, this will involve review, at the prime and subcontract level, of the type and number of labor-hours proposed per task as well as the types and kinds of materials, equipment and fabrication costs proposed. It is expected that the effort will leverage all available relevant prior research in order to obtain the maximum benefit from the available funding. Company commitment to the success of the proposed program, including management involvement, commitment of key personnel and other non-monetary company resources, risk sharing and for efforts with a likelihood of commercial application, appropriate direct cost sharing may be a positive factor in the evaluation. Any limitations in rights to deliverables may be considered in the evaluation. This evaluation criterion recognizes that undue emphasis on cost may motivate proposers to offer low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel in order to be in a more competitive posture. DARPA discourages such cost strategies. The proposer's abilities to aggressively pursue performance metrics in the shortest timeframe and to accurately substantiate that timeframe will be evaluated, as well as proposer's ability to understand, identify, and mitigate any potential risk in cost or schedule.</p>
<p>2. The following solicitation questions and answers are provided:</p>
<p>Q1. Are concepts based on deploying "shallow" water sensor(s) from the deep ocean of interest or must the sensor(s) be located in the deep ocean?<br />A1. Sensors operating in the deep ocean are of greater interest. From the BAA, concepts "should exploit the unique propagation and signal advantages afforded by operating in the deep ocean."</p>
<p>Q2. What is the expected duration of actual ASW "sensing" as opposed to deployment life?<br />A2. This depends on your concept of operation(s) and is not specified.</p>
<p>Q3. Many organizations in the room have great capability in one or two subsystem areas - but are not inclined to do the whole system. Is there interest/desire to receive subsystem architecture/trade studies or do they all have to be total system solution/conops?<br />A3. The BAA calls for system studies. The introduction of ambitious and new technology or subsystems is of high interest, but offerors need to provide the trade analysis and context of a system study to justify their subsystems.</p>
<p>Q4. Are only system studies eligible? What about leap ahead technology as a stand-alone in Phase I?<br />A4. Same answer as A3.</p>
<p>Q5. Are the proposer conference slides available?<br />A5. Yes. These will be sent to requesting offerors capable of proposing to the BAA. Slides will be sent with the BAA addendum.</p>
<p>Q6. Why mobility/UUV vice large number of fixed expendable nodes (if cheap enough) to achieve operational flexibility?<br />A6. Both are within the DSOP solution space, and both carry their own challenges with regard flexibility. For example, speed and cost of UUV versus storage and deployment of expendables.</p>
<p>Remaining questions and answers will be sent via the BAA Addendum package.</p>

<DESC>AMENDED TO UPDATE EXPECTED RFP ISSUANCE DATE&nbsp;AS APPROXIMATELY MID TO LATE FEBRUARY, 2010.<br /><br />AMENDED TO INCLUDE NOTICE THAT THERE WILL BE A PREPROPOSAL CONFERENCE FOR THIS EFFORT. DATE AND LOCATION TBD.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>A full and open competition is anticipated with a request for proposals expected to be issued <strong>APPROXIMATELY</strong> <strong>MID TO LATE FEBRUARY</strong>, 2010&nbsp;with proposals due approximately 30 days later.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   Amendment 1 to RFQ-DC-10-00053
The purpose of this amendment is to provide an estimated value, answer one question, and direct all interested parties to the EPA website. 
1) EPA estimates orders placed under the Basic Ordering Agreements to total approximately $500,000 annually. This estimate is not guaranteed and represents the aggregate value of potential  work ordered from all BOA holders together.
2) Question: May vendors reply to this announcement to analyze only DLM02.2 and the 12 dioxin-like PCBs for CBC01.2? Our laboratory is not interested in performing analysis for all 209 congeners.
Answer: Vendors may be awarded a BOA for DLM02.2 and a subset of PCB congeners, as long as the subset includes the WHO list. However, the laboratory will not be eligible to bid on individual projects that require one lab to perform both the dioxin and full list of PCB congeners.
3) It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/1000053/index.htm for future updates to this procurement.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 10:<br /><br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) SUBPART 9.2- Qualification Requirements; The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is establishing a Qualified Products List (QPL) for the Next Generation checked baggage Explosives Detection Systems (EDS) which serve as a primary screening device of airline passenger checked baggage. The establishment of the QPL will be based on current market-ready systems which must provide detection performance in accordance with TSA Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) Requirements for Automated Detection of Explosives Revision/dated 5.8 dated January 20, 2010.<br /><br />The items that are included under this QPL are:<br />1. Checked Baggage Screening Technology Reduced Size EDS<br />2. Checked Baggage Screening Technology Medium Speed EDS<br />3. Checked Baggage Screening Technology High Speed EDS<br /><br />Each EDS machine listed above shall constitute a separate category under a single QPL<br /><br />The Qualification process will consist of the following steps: <br /><br />1. Vendor submission of the Certification Readiness Testing Qualification Data Package (CRT-QDP) in accordance with the Certification Readiness Testing Qualification Management Plan (CRT-QMP ). <br /><br />2. Upon successful completion of the CRT-QDP vendors systems will enter into the Technical Testing which requires vendors to provide three systems for technical testing and submission of a Certification Data Package.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Upon successful completion of the technical testing (which includes initial operational testing) vendors will be "Qualified" and listed on the QPL.<br /><br />4. Qualified Vendors will receive subsequent Solicitation (s); specifically the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Fiscal Year 2010 Checked Baggage Inspection System (CBIS) . The RFP is currently planned to be released in August 2010. <br /><br />The Qualification program represented by the steps listed above is described in greater detail in the CRT-QMP. Details provided include hardware delivery requirements, due dates, the program schedule and Government Point of Contacts (POCs). It is imperative that interested vendors request the CRT-QMP in a timely fashion as the CRT-QDP is required to be submitted by 1 March 2010. <br /><br />This requirement necessitates that vendors have access to documents Classified as SECERT and Sensitive Security Information (SSI). In order to obtain these documents vendors must have an approved DD 254 on file with TSA. If a vendor has previously registered and has been approved for a DD 254 under the RFI HSTS04-09-R-ST2180, the DD 254 is still in effect for the Qualification process. <br /><br />In addition to needing a DD 254, in order to obtain any documents classified as SSI, vendors are required to be a registered vendor and all personnel who will need access to this data must have a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) on file, and must be pre-approved by TSA to have access to classified information. <br /><br />All interested vendors are required to submit a request for documentation to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov . The request for documentation MUST contain the following information:<br />&bull; Company Name, <br />&bull; Mailing &amp; Street address (NO PO Boxes ) <br />&bull; Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code &amp; Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS number)<br />&bull; POC and contact information for :<br /><strong>Program Manager (main POC)</strong><br /><strong>Facility Security Officer</strong> <br /><strong>Sensitive Security Information POC</strong>: This person is required to be a senior corporate official who will serve as the single POC for SSI. This official must certify that SSI will be protected in accordance with policy and procedures. This official is required to notify the Contracting Officer of staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information. <br />&bull; A signed statement from the SSI POC certifying that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information, and that the Contracting Officer will be notified of any staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information.<br />&bull; List of all personnel that will need access to Classified and SSI documents related to this requirement. Please identify to which level of access. (TSA may require the submission of additional personal information, if necessary.)<br />&bull; State whether the vendor is interested entering into a lease with TSA for the required systems. (TSA is currently researching options to help defray the costs which include allowing vendors to use Government-Owned EDS and or entering into a lease with the Government to fulfill testing requirements.)<br /><br />The Government will review the request and if approved provide the necessary documentation, if disapproved the Government will contact the identified POC for final disposition.<br /><br />For vendors not participating in the initial round, there will be additional opportunities to be placed on the QPL. <br /><br />Qualified vendors will compete with other contract holders for delivery orders. Vendors should be aware that TSA intends to award delivery orders based on Best Value, which will take into consideration an offeror's ability to meet non-minimum requirements. TSA reserves the right to require re-certification and/or perform additional testing, if deemed necessary. <br /><br />The procurement will be announced on the FedBizOpps.gov website, but only qualified vendors on the QPL will receive the solicitation.<br />

<DESC>THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) AWARDED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ANDREINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 A TASK ORDER FOR ENGINEERING SUPPORT SERVICES UNDER THEPREVIOUSLY AWARDED, COMPETITIVE 8(a) CONTRACT NNC06BA07B WITH ASRC AEROSPACE CORPORATION. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) represent new vehicle and operational concepts in civilaviation.  These new concepts are evolving as the nation moves toward the Next GenerationAir Transportation System (NextGen), which is under the leadership of the Joint Planningand Development Office (JPDO).	The desire and ability to fly UAS in the National AirSpace (NAS) in the near term has increased dramatically.  Although unmanned aircraft havethe ability to support a number of dull, dirty and dangerous missions required by thenations science community (NASA, NOAA), emergency management (FEMA, DOA) and nationalsecurity and defense organizations (DHS, DOD), existing federal air regulations,procedures and technologies do not allow routine UAS access to the NAS. The currentprocess of requesting a Certificate of Waiver of Authorization (COA) to operate a UAS inthe national airspace today is extremely resourceintensive and lengthy.	These COAs are restrictive and often lack the flexibility to meetthe full mission needs.  The UAS project provides NASA support to this multi-agencyobjective of enabling safe, routine access for unmanned aircraft systems in the nationalairspace.  Over the course of the next 12 months, the UAS Project will focus onsupporting a multi-agency effort to develop and implement a national plan to successfuladdress the challenges of UAS access to the NAS (National Air Space) in a safe and timelymanner.  In order to support this activity, the UAS Project will develop two Concept ofOperations (ConOps) documents.	From these documents, overall Research and Development(R&D) needs will be identified.NASA/GRC has issued a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B to developdocumentation on research and development requirements that will guide how futureunmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can safely operate in the national airspace. Specifically, the research for this task focuses on how unmanned aircraft systems cansafely communicate with ground controllers using existing communication systems, as thenumber of UAS continue to increase in the future.  This task also focuses on weatherhazards as they impact UAS during flight.  The result of this task is analysis andidentification of research and development needs for UAS communication systems, includingweather hazards that impact UAS during flight. THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. A CPAF order is appropriate for this procurement because of the uncertain nature of theresearch/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<BR>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<BR><BR><BR><BR>1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Omaha District (USACE).<BR><BR>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The Omaha District proposes to procure a Firm Fixed Price Contract, not to exceed $30,000.   The contract acquisition strategy is a Sole Source contract to MJ Harden Associates Inc.  The contract will acquire geographic data sets for further technical refinement and use in a proposed digital computer simulation of nonstructural flood risk reduction techniques.<BR><BR>3.  BACKGROUND: The National Nonstructural Flood Proofing Committee (NFPC), which is an extension of the Planning Directorate of HQUSACE and has member affiliation through the Omaha District, is pursuing the development of a digital computer model to visually illustrate the effectiveness of nonstructural flood proofing techniques for urban floodplain areas.  The NFPC digital model, utilizing existing and available basin hydrology and hydraulics, would replace existing physical models which have become cost prohibitive for storage, transport, set-up, and maintenance. The digital computer model would utilize Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) imagery and a bare earth digital terrain model (DTM) with three-dimensional building footprints and facades to illustrate the potential for flood risk reduction by implementing nonstructural techniques such as elevation, relocation, and barrier construction.  The digital model would be used nationally in conjunction with the Corps National Flood Risk Management Program to illustrate comparisons of pre-project and post-project nonstructural techniques and promote the cost-effectiveness of implementing such techniques in an urban environment.  <BR> <BR>4.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The services required under the proposed Firm Fixed Price Contract would be for acquisition of all unclassified LIDAR Return Data (Raw Data) in LAS, X, Y, Z ASCII, or ESRI Shape file format for a 2,400 foot corridor of Brush Creek, in Kansas City, Missouri. The Contractor would provide a bare earth DTM in ESRI grid 1-meter, ESRI file formats, generated from bare earth randomly spaced points. Approximately 95% of elevation points related with vegetation, buildings, and structures will be removed from the data set to produce the bare earth DTM. Breaklines will be incorporated into the surface of the DTM.<BR><BR>Three-dimensional building footprints in ESRI shapefile format will be generated from the existing LiDAR and digital imagery. All buildings within 2,400 foot corridor of creek centerline will be collected and provided with true surface heights in ESRI shapefile format. Building faade templates will be placed on sides of buildings. Rooftops will be flat, monopoly shaped buildings.  As part of the contract, initial three-dimensional buildings with true surface heights in ESRI shapefile format will be modified for nonstructural flood risk modeling.  Foundations will be colored by type to represent elevation of structures, removal, or protection by barrier.<BR><BR>Metadata will be provided once for the entire project and will include GPS base station survey point description and date and time of data acquisition. Data file format description and file naming convention along with map coordinate system, vertical and horizontal datum, and units of measurements used will be provided.<BR> <BR><BR>5.  AUTHORITY CITED:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a) (iii) (A) Only One Responsible Source. <BR><BR>6.  BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  <BR><BR>     a. Background:  The basis for this requirement is that the services being requested are unique and require specificity relative to LiDAR DTM development knowledge, skills and capabilities to provide bare earth terrain data with three-dimensional ESRI shapefile format for all commercial and residential buildings and the ability to retrofit the initial building shapefile with nonstructural measures.   Through market analysis conducted over a two-year period by the NFPC committee, no contractor or entity was determined to be available, other than MJ Harden Associates Inc, that currently meets the unique qualifications of having existing data available, and the ability to perform the services identified in item 4, and who could immediately perform this work without causing significant delay or cost increases to the government.<BR><BR>     b. Justification:  A contractor providing the services under the proposed contract must posses significant geographic computer capabilities, experience, expertise and knowledge and refined techniques to provide the computer DTM which will form the nucleus of the nonstructural digital computer model.  MJ Harden Associates Inc currently possesses existing LiDAR data, they have staff experienced with the preparation of three-dimensional digital imagery and personnel are trained in the computer generated processes of retrofitting three-dimensional shapefiles to interact with floodplain engineering modeling.  The Brush Creek Basin data set meets the needs of the NFPC by representing an urbanized digital terrain model, with three-dimensional commercial and residential building footprints, which may be enhanced by utilizing existing hydrology and hydraulic engineering data for this location made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.    <BR>    <BR>     c. Impact:  The nonstructural digital model is being developed by the NFPC through the Omaha District to be used as an educational tool for the implementation of nonstructural flood risk reduction measures.  The final model will utilize digital terrain data for the Brush Creek Basin through Kansas City, Missouri along with existing hydrological information to illustrate the performance of nonstructural engineering techniques within an urbanized basin.  Failure to procure the necessary data sets will prevent the development of this educational tool and result in noncompliance with Section 73 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974, which requires consideration of nonstructural alternatives in all flood damage reduction studies.  Lack of knowledge of nonstructural flood damage reduction techniques during the plan formation process could result in overall higher project costs and less effective results due to study emphasis and implementation of structural measures only.     <BR><BR>     <BR>7.  MARKET RESEARCH:  The NFPC has investigated the availability of interested and capable sources for providing the required computer data and services without success.  Several companies had existing LiDAR data sets available, but either there was no three dimensional structure data available, no hydrologic information available, they did not have the capability to modify the three dimensional structure data set in accordance with NFPC committee needs, or a combination of all three. The NFPC has examined whether the required services can be structured in such a way as to provide opportunities for competition or Small Business concerns.  This is not cost effective or technically feasible because of the integrated nature of the LiDAR data to the digital terrain model and the three-dimensional building inventory.  Subdividing the data acquisition from the baseline three-dimensional building imagery and building shapefile modifications could result in invalidation of the data, preventing the successful development of  a digital computer model for educational purposes.  Currently, the Brush Creek Basin LiDAR data set, the digital terrain model, the three-dimensional building imagery, and the hydrologic elements are a matched set, which enables the NFPC to achieve their objective of developing a computer model illustrating nonstructural flood risk management techniques.   <BR><BR>8.  TIMELINE COMMITMENTS:   The NFPC has been charged with the development of a digital computer model illustrating the effectiveness of nonstructural flood proofing techniques for urban floodplain areas.  During the past two years the committee has investigated the availability of urban terrain data, three-dimensional building inventories, capabilities for modifying three-dimension building shapefiles, and the hydrologic data associated with the terrain.  Funding was provided to the committee during fiscal year 2009 for the acquisition of data and development of a digital computer model.  The timeline proposed for the completion of the digital model is May 2010, at which time the model would be presented at the Association of State Flood Plain Managers at their national conference in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This event would be followed with presentations during the National Association of Flood & Stormwater Managers conference and a presentation to members of  USACEs Planners Associates class.
