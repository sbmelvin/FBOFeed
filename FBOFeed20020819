C.1.19	Should the contractor and/or Jim Dawson, BLM, locate any archaeological artifacts, the site will be protected and the BLM, Ukiah Field Office Archaeologist notified.  C.2.0	Project Start and Completion Dates:  The objective is to have the fuel break cutting and mastication begin after November 1, 2002, and be completed on or before March 14, 2003.  This period will permit the contractor to operate the equipment outside of the declared fire season, as well as, the nesting period for most avian species.

<DESC>This notice is the official pre-solicitation notice under the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) solicitation #DTFR53-02-R-0008. The Department of Transportation, FRA, has a requirement to acquire contractor support services capable of evaluating the Guided Lamb Wave (GLW) approach of the Acoustic Emission Testing (AE) when applied to tank cars. The contractor will evaluate a refined AE inspection in its present state.  AE testing is considered a passive technique due to the fact that the sensors just "listen" and any sound that is detected is usually generated by a defect under load.  If a pulsar were to be added to the AE setup, the equipment being tested could be periodically pulsed to determine the state of the material between the pulsar and the AE receivers.  This form of active monitoring can be categorized as a GLW approach and will be the basis of the
Request for Proposal (RFP).  The following tasks are to be performed.  Task 1 - Kick off meeting, Task 2 - Determine Sensitivity Requirements, Task 3 - Develop Inspection Standards, Task 4 - Data Collection, Task 5 - Data Analysis, Task 6 - Software Development Part I, Task 7 - Software Development Part II, Task 8 - Field Testing, Task 9 - Further Data Analysis, Task 10 - Demonstration & Evaluation.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) award is anticipated. The period of performance will be 14 months from date of award. The solicitation for this proposed contract will be available to interested parties via the internet at www.FEDBIZOPS.gov.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.  Potential offerors shall be responsible for monitoring the Internet site for the release of the solicitation, amendments (if any), and responses to any questions submitted in accordance with the solicitation.  Issuance of the Request for Proposal is anticipated on or about September 1, 2002. This is an unrestricted solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the FRA.

EMAIL  ADDRESS: meltesen@mail1.monmouth.army.mil or harperk@mail1.monmouth.army.mil  This is a market survey to locate additional commercial sources for the procurement of Transponders.  The RT-1471A/APX-100 is part of the AN/APX-100(V) family of Legacy Transponders that has been manufactured exclusively by Raytheon (formerly) Allied Signa l, and therefore, there already exists complete provisioning, logistics and maintenance support in place.  This sole-source solicitation is not meant to be used as a vehicle for the Army to procure an upgraded/updated replacement for the current legacy AN/ APX 100 Systems.  Replacement of the legacy Transponder Sets is a tri-service objective that will be satisfied with the acquisition of the new AN/APX-118(V) Digital Transponder starting Fiscal Year 2003. The solicitation shall be for a firm fixed price tw o(2) year IDIQ contract for a minimum quantity of 15 to a maximum quantity of  115 transponders.  There are currently no detailed Technical Data or hardware available from the Army.

CECOM will not want to spend the time and money to AIMS qualify new Transponder sets or incur any  additional cost  due to new/additional provisioning, logistics and maintenance support for a different AN/APX-100 configuration. Production Lead Time of 6-9 months is required.  Meet the requirements of MIL-R-81876B.  The current commercial source for Transponders that me et all the above criteria is Raytheon Systems Company.  Detailed Technical Data and updated/current drawings are not available from the Army.  Potential suppliers capable of providing these these Transponders must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USA CECOM,  ATTN:  AMSEL-LC-IEW-C-CM, Building 1201E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.  The response must include documentation such as test results and Technical Data, demonstrating compliance with the above.

<DESC>The government has a requirement for 6000 lbs of a nitramine based feedstock for use in current facilities at IH. The material is a granulated EX99 formulation which has been successfully demonstrated in the past 5 years under sole source contracts to Nexplo Explosives. It is manufactured via a patented process, patent # 4 983235, held by Nexplo Explosives.  The material has been previously purchased from Nexplo and manufactured into a final form at IH. Under special license agreement from Nexplo the Navy is currently designing and building a facility to manufacture this material at IH.  Due to delays the facility will not be online in time to manufacture the material to meet the Navy's qualification time schedule.  Therefore the material must be acquired from Nexplo to prevent qualification time schedule slippage.  The Navy anticipates awarding a sole source contract to Nexplo E xplosives to acquire the material to continue qualification.  The NAICS Code is 325920, Size Standard is 750 employees and FSC Code is 1375. The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price contract. Negotiation being conducted using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1). Questions should be directed to Samantha Gray, Contract Specialist who can be reached at (301) 744-6747 or email graysm@ih.navy.mil

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Flow Cytometry Unit (FCU) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Beckman Coulter, 8920 Route 108, Columbia, Maryland 21045, for cost per test for immunophenotyping reagents.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  Part I. Reagents.  The Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Flow Cytometry Unit (FCU) requires a more proficient mechanism for the preparation of biological materials and other fluids for flow cytometric immunophenotyping. Currently the laboratory performs tests manually. This requires 100% concentration and is laborious and time consuming as well as being a major focus of laboratory errors.  The laboratory receives more requests for their services than they can perform with current personnel and technology.  Specimens are being sent out at great expense to NCI protocols.  Currently the reagents being used are; CD3 PC5, Flow Check Fluorospheres, Flow-Set Fluorospheres, Whole blood lyse kit 300T, Isoflow, Coulter CLENZ, CD10 PC5, and CD5 PC5 reagents. The laboratory currently has a Government owned flow cytometer to aid in the preparation of these immunophenotyping tests.  Therefore, the need for reagent supplies to operate the existing flow cytometer and to produce more tests, the use of a new flow cytometer stainer and laser are required.  The laboratory currently tests approximately 900 specimens annually, setting up anywhere from 1-22 4 color tubes (4 different antibodies in each tube). With a 10 tube panel, 40 different antibodies in may combinations. Minimum Requirements: REAGENTS; Antibodies and other supplies must be of high quality and are extensively tested prior to use in the laboratory.  The antibodies must be of; 1) a particular clone type, 2) specificity and; 3) have a low antibody to fluorochrome ratio.  These particular antibodies/clones are used as therapeutics in our patient protocols.  Other reagents are fine with normal cells but fail to react with malignant cells and would fail to find tumor if they were used.  Therefore, each clone is tested and compared to certain standards.  Part II:  As a result of the cost per test, NCI will receive use of a Robotic sampler  which will allow the FCU to (1) provide accurate flow cytometric immunophenotyping service in the diagnostic evaluation of Clinical Center patients for hematopoietic neoplasia; (2) instruct residents and fellows in interpretation of clinical flow cytometric immunophenotypic results; and (3) plan and conduct research on human and animal diseases. Minimum Requirements: Equipment;  1) robotic pipetting and RBC lysing system, 2) allow precise, accurate and timely measured aliquots of expensive reagents to be pipetted into multiple tubes.  Presently these antibodies are measured by hand creating documented multiple problems with inappropriately measured and pipetted tubes. 3) allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple complex parameters so that cell size, granularity, DNA content, viability (including the presence of apoptotic cells), cell kinetics, apoptotic markers and the presence of multiple intracellular and surface proteins can be determined for each cell in a sample studied, 4)  data produced is both quantitative and objective, thus reducing bias in diagnostic evaluation. This highly sensitive technique, coupled with the ability to rapidly analyze multiple parameters in large numbers of cells, allows the detection of small sub-populations of neoplastic cells.  Flow cytometry is a sensitive technique for the analysis of benign and malignant tumors. The results of minimal residual disease detection can in some disease processes surpass molecular testing (sensitivities of one in ten to the third [1in 103] routinely achieved and on in ten to the sixth [1 in 106] achieved with special techniques). The Flow Cytometry Unit is required in the study and refinement of this technique and its application to diagnosis and measurement of prognostic indicators in different systems. Beckman Coulter is the only source known to NCI that can provide the reagents and instruments that are required to perform the procedures to prepare flow cytometric immunophenotyping. The reagents are proprietary to Beckman Coulter as well as the instruments, they are designed to be compatible with the Flow Cytometer currently located in the laboratory. The Government will be the direct beneficiary of a contract for reagents and supplies because it will maintain and improve the quality of patient care and further cancer research.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of experiments in progress.  Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through twelve (12) months, with four (4) twelve (12) month option renewals if exercised;  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Service (November 1999),  FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  The requirement will be a fixed price order.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 3, 2002.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB) intends to procure  
Contrast Agent; catalog number OXo63  (EPR-Line substance, 92 grams), for Phillips Overhauser Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (OMRI) for Studying Tumor Physiology from Amersham Health, R&D AB Medeon, SE-205 12, Malmo Sweden.  The supplies and services herein are being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees. The Radiation Research Branch has a research interest in the treatment of malignant tumors by non-surgical modalities, like radiation or chemotherapy, which may be influenced both by the genetic properties of the tumor cells and epigenetic factors of the tumor micromilieu.   The proposed research involves the use of Overhauser Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (OMRI) to obtain functional/physiologic information in tumors using, which treatment regimens will be adjusted depending on the oxygen status of the tumors and appropriate therapies can be instituted.  While extensive research is presently ongoing to develop gene therapy strategies targeted to tumor cells, the development of therapeutic regimens to exploit the physiological differences between normal and malignant tissue might also provide options for improved treatment. Some of the physiological differences between normal tissue and tumors include oxygen status, redox status, and intracellular pH. These differences, at least in part, can result from the physical architecture of the tumors with compromised blood supply. Methods that can detect subtle differences in the above physiological parameters would greatly aid in devising appropriate treatment strategies. Redox status and tissue pO2 are two factors, which are hypothesized to be different in normal and malignant tissues. Techniques that enable rapid and noninvasive measurements of these two parameters in individual patients, therefore, would extend our knowledge and clinical acumen. This technique can be effectively used to gain information regarding tumor physiology. This is relevant to several ongoing preclinical and clinical studies being conducted at NCI.  There are two components in this technique: 1) The low field OMRI scanner; 2) Suitable contrast agent which can provide optimal Overhauser Enhancements.  NCI has a custom built OMRI scanner from Philips Medical Systems.  The contrast agent is a crucial aspect of this study and the requirements in terms of amount is in range of 100 grams/year. Information obtained from OMRI is unique with respect to the physiological information it provides which can be co-registered with standard MRI data. Therefore it becomes now possible to characterize a tissue on the basis of important functional information such as tissue pO2, which would otherwise be not possible by most radiological techniques. The non-invasive nature of OMRI in providing such information holds significant promise in clinical radiology, particularly in tumor physiology characterization by non-invasive means and develops optimal treatment protocols. Current methods to characterize tumor pO2 to decide the radiation treatment planning are highly invasive leading to issues regarding patient comfort and compliance making such studies difficult. Amersham Health Biotech is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the contrast agents. The Phillips OMRI is the only machine, which can provide readings as such a low level (10Mt). This technique has the potential of providing both functional as well as physiological information using spin probe tracer using the low field OMRI.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on September 3, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax (301) 402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Contracts and Controls Review Department (CCRD) has a requirement for professional audit services in support its Premium Compliance program. It is anticipated that the PBGC may award one or more contracts on a labor-hour basis in support of this program. There is an estimated 9,225 hours of effort to be performed in the base year and similar quantities in each of four option years. The primary objective of the Premium Compliance program is to assess compliance with PBGC premium regulations and filing requirements. Reports issued by contractors will provide input as to whether plan sponsors have paid PBGC the appropriate amount of premiums and met other filing requirements. In doing so, the contractor will be responsible for complying with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Government Auditing Standards as they relate to application of agreed-upon procedures and examinations, as appropriate.  As PBGC has the burden of proving that plan sponsors did not pay the appropriate amount of premiums and the work of the contractor may be subject to review in court proceedings, it is critical that all work be performed in accordance with the referenced auditing standards. Firms interested in this requirement may view additional information regarding the PBGC at its web site: www.pbgc.gov. The solicitation will be made available through the FedBizOps.gov web site. The estimated release date of the solicitation is February 8, 2002. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration by the agency.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This combined synopsis/solicitation replaces Sole Source synopsis RFQ2-38187-MSC which was canceled August 13, 2002. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This document provides specifications for the procurement of a set of software tools to be used in the development of a flight simulation system aimed at synthetic vision research. Two main capabilities are needed: 1) generation of terrain databases, models (airports, buildings, vehicles, etc), and displays (panel mounted, cockpit gauges, head up, symbology superimposed on out-the-window, etc.), and 2) a simulation runtime capable of loading the resulting models and running near real time with data generated by external vehicle models. For the terrain and model generation tool, the ability to easily create terrain databases from NIMA DTED (elevation) and DFAD (feature) data and texture the resulting terrain with detailed satellite/aerial photos is required. The software should also have the capability to read the currently popular model and terrain database formats, such as OpenFlight, so that existing databases can be used and modified. Additionally, the software should be able to easily stitch models into terrain databases without the need for extensive hand editing. For the simulation runtime, the ability to load models and databases in the currently popular formats, such as OpenFlight, is a must. The runtime should be in the form of an API with C language bindings (C++ only bindings would not be acceptable). The desired operating system for both the terrain generation and the simulation runtime software is Red Hat Linux version 7.2 or above. However, any Microsoft Windows operating system is deemed acceptable for the terrain generation software since it's only used for offline database generation. The simulation runtime, however, has to be capable of running under Red Hat Linux. In the current application, the procured software will be used to develop a helicopter primary flight display (symbology superimposed on out-the-window scenery) and a navigation display, including real time information sharing between the two displays, as described in this document.  The simulation software is targeted to Quantum3D GraphiteVZ computers with the Sentriris Graphics board. Display resolution shall be supported from 640x480 through 1280x1024.  The update rate for the simulation described in this document shall be 30Hz, minimum, 60 Hz preferred. For the bottom most layer of the primary flight display, the terrain generation software shall be able to import, prior to simulation, digital terrain elevation data (DTED), Space Shuttle STS99 radar mapping data, and digital feature analysis data (DFAD) from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) archives to create a 3D terrain database.  Also prior to simulation, the terrain generation software shall have the tools to allow the user to create new 3 dimensional objects in the terrain database, such as roads, buildings, and trees.  During simulation with the runtime software, the rendering of the terrain database with the user-added objects, shall be performed from a 3D perspective view of the current location and orientation of the pilot's aircraft and head (for a head-mounted display).  The aircraft and head orientation information shall be received using TCP/IP sockets on an Ethernet network.  The field-of-view of the rendered terrain database shall be user selectable prior to and during the simulation.	During the simulation, the rendering of the terrain database with user added objects must include a user selectable (in real time) amount of simulated fog with both linear and exponential variation of the fog density.  This layer will be output as NTSC from one Quantum3D Sentiris Graphics Board for input into a second Quantum 3D Sentriris Graphics Board, which will add the remaining layers.  The terrain generation software shall be capable of  automatic (at least partially automatic) photo-texturing (using ortho-rectified or raw photos from the NIMA  database) or random texturing, as set by the user prior to simulation.  The rendering shall be both color and monochrome.  A simulated infrared rendering of the terrain database is desired, but not required.  Compatibility with the existing OpenFlight file format is required. For the second layer of the primary flight display, the procured software shall render a mesh of the terrain database.  The mesh shall be colored, with a black border.  The software must support the changing of the density of the mesh during the simulation, as a function of pilot command or aircraft altitude.  The mesh shall not be displayed on hidden surfaces, such as the back-sides of hills.  The mesh shall not be subject to fog.  Compatibility with the existing OpenFlight file format is required. The third layer of the primary flight display shows earth-referenced symbology rendered as dynamic 3D objects at locations specified with respect to the terrain database.   The location and orientation of these objects change during the simulation, and are provided using the TCP/IP sockets on the Ethernet network.  The dynamic 3D objects shall not be hidden by intervening terrain.  Examples of dynamic 3D objects are predicted aircraft locations a few seconds in the future, and pilot-designated off-airfield landing sites.  In addition to any software tools provided by the vendor, the user must be able to render 3D objects using C language calls to OpenGL libraries. For the fourth layer of the primary flight display, the procured software shall render 2D objects, which will be non-earth referenced aircraft state symbology.  Examples of symbology include a ground speed indicator and engine torque indicator.  In addition to any software tools provided by the vendor, the user must be able to render 2D objects using C language calls to OpenGL libraries. For the navigation display, the bottom most layer shall show 2D, geometrically corrected, monochrome, satellite photographs from the NIMA database.  The scale on the photographs shall be pilot selected during the simulation.  The photographs shall scroll with aircraft location and rotate with aircraft heading, as provided on the TCP/IP sockets on the Ethernet network, such that user selected location on the screen indicates the location of the aircraft, and the top of the screen is in the direction of the aircraft's current heading. The second layer of the navigation display shall show color shading.  The color shading layer shall be generated from the 3D terrain database.  One possible color shading layer shall indicate terrain on the navigation display that is within a user-selected slope limit.	This layer may be generated prior to simulation.  Desirable, but not required, are color shading layers generated during the simulation, such as terrain with altitude above the aircraft's current altitude.  The color shading layers shall not obscure the satellite photo on the bottom layer. The third layer of the navigation display shall show 2D symbology.  Some of the symbology is referenced to, and move with, particular locations on the satellite photographs.  Examples include way-points, and landing sites.	Other 2D symbology are not referenced to the satellite photographs.  In addition to any software tools provided by the vendor, the user must be able to render 2D objects on the navigation display using C language calls to OpenGL libraries. The geographic coordinates of the terrain and dynamic objects rendered on the 3D primary flight display shall correlate with the geographic coordinates of the satellite photo rendered on the 2D navigation display.  Both displays will have touch-screens.  The procured software shall support having the pilot designate locations on the navigation display, and having mobile 3D objects placed at that geographic coordinate on the primary flight display.	An example is the pilot will designate a landing site on the navigation display, and a landing target will appear on the primary flight display.  The pilot on the primary flight display may use the touch-screen to move an icon over the terrain, and expect to see the corresponding location on the navigation display.  Geographic coordinate sharing between the two displays shall be via the TCP/IP sockets on the Ethernet network. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-08.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for services in support of its Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) to find data and, when necessary, perform experiments and analysis to add such data to the NIST MS Database.  The specific areas for which the MSDC is seeking data are in the areas of medically relevant compounds (both volatile and nonvolatile), pesticides, metabolic by-products, drug candidate compounds, new drugs of abuse, and performance enhancing drugs.  For each of these areas, data is sought for both the pure compound when volatile and the derivatized compounds when not. The specific derivatized compounds are the trimethylsilyl derivatives (TMS), the tertbutylldimethylsilyl derivatives (TBDMS) and the methyl derivatives (Me).  The data, so developed, should aid in the identification not only of the compounds specifically examined in these experiments, but also in the development of algorithms for the identification of classes of compounds in complex mixtures.  This is a small-business set-aside, NAICS Code 541710, size standard of 500 employees. The contract will be for a base year and 2 option years.

Support Leg Structure- Legs provide 48 inch clearance below the hopper discharge flange and are designed for seismic zone 4, 100 mph wind load, and 30 lbs per square foot roof load. Dust Laden Air Inlet- A high inlet creates a general downward air flow pattern in the filter section to optimize filter performance. Top and front inlet locations are standard on each module. Each filter column is protected from direct dust impingement by an internal baffle plate. Fibra-Web Filters- cartridges feature an open pleat banded design which improves pulse cleaning effectiveness when fibrous particles are present.  In addition, Eon Fine Fiber Technology by Donaldson Company intercepts small particles at the surface of the media. Each cartridge contains 120 square feet of media for a total of 960 square feet in the collector. Filter Cleaning- Cartridges are automatically cleaned by periodic pulses of compressed air flowing in the opposite direction of normal air flow. The proprietary ExtraLife cleaning system provides a uniform pulse for maximum cleaning effectiness. Cleaning Controls- Torit Delta P Control which provides digital indication of differential pressure and initiates compressed air cleaning at a preset filter restriction. The Torit Delta P Control also indicates when the system is cleaning and when the filter restriction reaches a preset high level indicator light. Filter Access-cartridges are accessed from outside the collector through round access ports on the front of the unit. Each port provides access to two filter cartridges. No tools are required for filter removal installation. Filters are angled 15 degrees for easier servicing.

Explosion Relief Vents  One 24 inch by 47 inch explosion relief vent is located on the top side of unit. Explosion vents limit overpressure in the event of a deflagration in order to maintain the structural integrity of the collector. Bag In/Bag Out Filter Access- The bag in bag out feature allows the removal of filter cartridges while isolating the cartridges and dirty air side of the collector from the operator. This feature includes bagging rings on each access port, security straps to secure the bags, and factory modifications at the cartridge support yoke. UltraLok- 1 high by 2 wide housing with two HEPA filters and two pre-filters. Includes magnehelic gage. Bin Level Indicator-Electromechanical point level control for use with dry materials.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Progressive Health, 9105 Paddock Ln., Potomac, MD.  This procurement will provide scientific and technical writing on the development of reports, speeches, and other relevant written documents related to cancer health disparities.  The Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities is responsible for coordinating and directing implementation of NCI?s strategic plan to reduce cancer-related health disparities as the Institute directs its research efforts and resources to understand the causes of cancer health disparities and to develop effective interventions to reduce them.  The NCI Strategic Plan to Reduce Health Disparities is part of a major national commitment to identify and address the underlying causes of disease and disability in racial and ethnic communities.  Because these communities carry and unequal burden of cancer-related health disparities, NCI is working to enhance its research, education and training programs that focus on populations in need.  The Center was created to provide NCI with the leadership required to coordinate trans-NCI efforts to examine the disparate burden of cancer, build a comprehensive portfolio to support and conduct research needs in cancer health disparities, and to provide a forum whereby NCI can contribute in the translation of research to application for reducing cancer health disparities.  Suzanne Reuben of Progressive Health Systems has the sophisticated levels of critical thinking skills and scientific background, including outstanding science writing and editing skills, that are required to organize, analyze and formulate reports on the complex scientific, socio-economic issues that have impact on cancer health disparities.  She has an understanding of the research activities of the NCI through a broad range of experiences in developing documents for a variety of cancer-related programs and for a variety of audiences.  This experience includes work on a series of reports published by the President?s Cancer Panel since 1993, including seminal reports dealing with cancer health disparities.  Further, she has worked on the NCI Bypass Budget to the President of the U.S. for fiscal years 1997-2001, developed the final report of the NCI Breast Cancer Progress Review Group which was a major component of the report on NCI?s women?s health activities, and as a writer for the President?s Cancer Panel Special Commission on Breast Cancer. These unique experiences with writing in cancer-related topics, and her organizational and analytical skills required to handle these complex issues are critical to the specialized and highly respected reports required by the Center.  There is no other science writer as well qualified for this work as Suzanne Reuben of Progressive Health Systems.  Ms. Ruben?s experience in working with NCI, and the President?s Cancer Panel make her uniquely qualified to meet the needs of CRCHD for science writing, editing and research assistance. It is anticipated that an awarded will be made for one year, plus a one year option period.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement,  it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 4,  2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) seeks to acquire mass spectral data in areas of need in the NIST Mass Spectral database.  Specifically, spectral data for O-silyl, N-acyl, and methyl derivatives of mono- and poly- functional compounds are sought.  These spectra need to be measured using a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and must be reference quality mass spectra.  The mass spectra shall be sent to NIST in electronic form.  The Chemical Abstracts Service registry number shall be included if available, as well as the chemical name, the chemical structure, and the measured retention index.  The contractor shall measure a minimum of 1200 up to a maximum of 3000 mass spectra per year.  The contract shall consist of a base period of one year starting with the date of the award and 4 option periods of one year each.  The total number of spectra to be measured for the base and option periods shall not exceed 15000.  NIST requires delivery of a minimum of 100 measured spectra per calendar month.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Data Center (MSDC) is receiving a steady influx of new spectra that need to be evaluated before being added to the NIST Mass Spectral Database. This evaluation needs to be done in a timely and efficient manner.  The contractor shall evaluate the quality of reported mass spectra by using the structure of the compound and known good spectra of similar compounds.  The evaluation shall involve determining that the mass spectrum of a compound with a given structure is reasonable by using probable losses from the molecular ion, and well-established rearrangements of ions with corresponding neutral losses from the structure of the presumed starting compound.  The evaluation shall require the ability to assess the possibility of contamination either by air, water, isomers, or other species that may co elute in gas-chromatography columns.  In addition, the evaluation will require the ability to evaluate the probability of thermal decomposition of the molecule in the ion-source of the mass spectrometer and an understanding of the ions resulting from species that have no stable ions. NIST will provide to the contractor copies of the spectra to be evaluated along with the names and chemical structures of the presumed starting compounds.  These will be provided either as paper copies of the spectra or in electronic format.  In order to read the electronic files a copy of the NIST Mass Spectra Search Program will be made available to the contractor. The contractor shall have experience in examining both good and bad spectra.  The minimum requirements for this work include, but are not limited to, a degree in chemistry and at least two years of experience analyzing and evaluating mass spectra data.  Experience with routine mass spectra analysis is not sufficient for this purpose.  Published papers showing research in correlating spectra to structure or documented prior experience with such correlations must be provided.  NIST will deliver a minimum of 15000 up to a maximum of 25000 mass spectra per year with the associated structures that should be analyzed.  The contract shall consist of a base period of one year starting with the date of the award and 4 option periods of one year each.  The total number of spectra to be analyzed for the base and option periods shall not exceed 125000.  NIST will deliver a minimum of 1250 spectra per month for evaluation.  NIST requires delivery of the analysis no later than 45 calendar days following the receipt of the spectra and structures from NIST - FOB Destination. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The competitive solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  The solicitation, SB1341-02-R-0035, is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 14, 2002 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.  Potential offers are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  There is no written solicitation document available, telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders lists will be maintained.  If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Diane Loeb on 301 975-6399 or via email dloeb@nist.gov. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Request for Information for the fabrication of eyewear for the Department of Defense
<SOLNBR>N62645-02-R-0019
<RESPDATE>082602
<ARCHDATE>09102002
<CONTACT>Tim Moffatt, Procurement Analyst, Phone (301) 619-7468, Fax (301) 619-2925, Email tjmoffatt@us.med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.  Background
1.0.  The Department of Defense is evaluating an optional business strategy that will divest the Government from the fabrication of eyewear for the Department of Defense (DoD) including certain client organizations, the United States Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, etc.
B.  Purpose of this Request for Information, RFI
1.0.  To evaluate the practicality of this option and to make the best business decision, the DoD requests that the optical fabrication industry provide certain data that the Government will use in a comprehensive business case analysis.  The Government believes that these data are commonly available business data.  If proprietary information is provided, it is the offerors responsibility to mark that information using the standards contained within the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 3-104).
2.0.  The data required herein will NOT result in the award of contracts for the fabrication of eyewear for the DoD.  These data are for information and planning purposes ONLY.  If the DoD determines that this strategy has merit, solicitations may be issued in accordance with applicable FAR and DoD implementing regulations and instructions.
3.0.  Although the Government will reasonably accept questions from offerors regarding this RFI, no information will be provided regarding divestiture, future planning options or solicitations yet-to-be-issued.
4.0.  The Governments cost of optical fabrication data is not available to industry.
C.  Operational Definitions
1.0.  Afloat/deployed.  Those operational units of the DoD that are either deployed and at sea or deployed OCONUS.  Deployed units may or may not be participating in armed conflicts.
2.0.  CONUS.  The 48 contiguous Continental United States.
3.0.  Customer Return Error Rate:  Finished eyewear that does not comply with either the eyewear prescription or fabrication requirements as described herein.  Errors may be identified by the end user but will always be validated by the Governments clinical professional.  Errors are further defined herein.
4.0.  Finished Optical Job.  A finished optical job includes the cost of the frames, the cost of the lenses, the cost of fabrication, the cost of quality assurance, mailing costs, software costs, and the cost of a standard hard sided protective case for each pair of spectacles.  The offeror shall also include all costs of overhead, profit/fee and any other reasonable expenses to receive requests for eyewear, fabricate that eyewear and return completed eyewear to the requiring medical treatment facility(s) or established eyewear ordering accounts.
5.0.  NOSTRA.  The Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity, Yorktown, VA.  For the purpose of this RFI, the largest central optical fabrication laboratory within the DoD. 
6.0.  OCONUS.  Outside the 48 contiguous Continental United States.
7.0.  OFE.  The DoDs tri-service Optical Fabrication Enterprise.  For the purpose of this RFI, the OFE coordinates all optical fabrication activities for the DoD.  The OFE includes all DoD fabrication laboratories world-wide.
D.  Proposed Process for Fabrication of Eyewear
1.0.  The process described below is notional, based on the Governments need for the business and technical information requested herein.  It offers a framework within which the offeror can reasonably provide the requested business and technical information and IS NOT BINDING ON EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR THE OFFEROR.  Therefore, in a hypothetical, divested environment operating under firm fixed price contracts with one or more industry source, the Government projects a system as detailed below.
1.1.  The Government (at any of the DoD?s medical treatment facilities or established eyewear ordering accounts) will provide the offeror with an eyewear prescription, the type of frame, and the priority.
1.2.  Eyewear prescriptions will be transmitted to the Contractor using Contractor provided hardware and/or software.  Eyewear prescriptions will be transmitted to the Contractor using a secure strong encrypted digital method using Contractor provided hardware and or software.  The Contractor will also have the capability to accept up to10percent of orders via FAX, phone, or standard mail/courier services.
1.3.  The Contractor will fabricate the eyewear and produce a finished optical job that meets the Governments quality standards.
1.4.  The finished optical job will be returned to the DoD medical treatment facility(s) in accordance with the Governments priorities for turnaround times.
1.5.  The Government will check the finished eyewear for accuracy and quality.  Upon acceptance, the eyewear will be dispensed to the patient.  If rejected, the Government will return the eyewear for re-work.  Re-work (including the cost of mailing back to Contractor) will be at no cost to the Government.
1.6.  The Contractor will provide a properly executed, itemized summary invoice to the Government not more often than twice each calendar month.
E.  Quality Standards
1.0.  In the spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet and, specifically on the tab titled, Finished Job (Offeror Quality), the Government requests that the offeror price those line items using the offerors quality standards.  The offerors quality standards are those standards that the offeror typically employs to provide finished optical jobs to their existing customer base.

2.0.  In the spreadsheet titled, ?DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet? and, specifically on the tab titled, Finished Job (Govt Quality), the Government requests that the offeror price those line items using the Government?s quality standards provided herein.  The Governments quality standards are those standards that it now employs to meet the expectations of the DoD customer.

3.0.  Governments Quality Standards

3.1.  ANSI quality standards applied.  The Governments quality standard strictly adheres to current applicable ANSI (Z80, Z87, Z86) quality standards.   All spectacles that meet or exceed these standards will be stamped with the ?Final Inspected by stamp of the individual performing the inspection.

3.2.  Customer Return Error Rate.  Based on a sample of 432,843 pair of spectacles which match the range and depth of the requirement contained herein, the Government?s customer return rate for the period from 1 July 2001 to 24 July 2002 was 952 pair of spectacles or a 0.2 percent (0.002) lab error rate.  This represents the rate of jobs returned by the customer to the lab for rework.  This is not the labs internal error rate.  This 0.2% customer return error rate is the standard that the offeror shall apply to their pricing to meet the requirements within the spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet and, specifically on the tab titled, Finished Job (Govt Quality).

3.2.1.  To amplify the definition above, an ?error? is further defined to include the discrepancies such as: Rx sent to the wrong account, Aberration of the lens, Wrong axis OD, OS or OU, Bad frame stock (defective), Wrong frame color, Wrong style temple, Wrong add power, Lens(es) are cocked, Requested prism missing, Lenses are scratched or pitted, Frame burnt, Lens(es) are too big for the frame, Lens(es) are too small for the frame, Lens(es) are flaked, Requested prism has the wrong direction or amount, Lens power is wrong, Wrong segment height, Undesired prism, Frame is broken, Wrong frame size, Wrong segment type, Wrong type or style frame, Lenses are reversed, PD is wrong, Requested UV400 missing, Requested tint missing, Poor bevel placement, Requested base curve wrong, Frame alignment poor, and Lenses or frame damaged in shipment.

3.3.  Delivery Priorities.  The Government?s turnaround times (by priority) are based on historic data.  These data indicate that from 2% to 10% of requests for eyewear require 24-hour turnaround (down pilots, recruit training, etc.), 5% to 40% require 3-day turnaround and 50% to 93% require 7-day turnaround.

F.  Surge Requirements.

1.0.  The Government has recent surge experience with Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm (DS/DS), Operation Enduring Freedom and post-September 11th.  These surge requirements occur across all categories of frames and lenses but are particularly acute in the specific areas of Protective Mask Inserts (PMI) and Sun Tint (N-15) requirements.  As additional detail, the DS/DS data indicates that PMI fabrication increased 379.94% and sun tint workload increased 189.83%.  The DS/DS data also indicates that 43% of eyewear was fabricated and shipped within 48 hours of receipt.  (NOTE:  The Government recognizes that the exact production data may be helpful to the offeror but the actual numbers cannot be released.)  However, the Government MUST have a system in place to accomplish this surge given a less than 7 day turnaround requirement for the vast majority of the work and a maximum 14 day turnaround for the remainder even under non-surge conditions.  If a divested strategy is chosen, empirical Government data shows that the duration of a surge may be: Long (7-10 months), Moderate (3-6 months), or Short (1-2 months).

2.0.  The offeror is free to extrapolate actual surge workload from the FY02 data that has been provided within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  However, recognizing that these data are not specific, the Government requests only that offerors provide information on their surge capacity, as detailed in the section herein titled, ?Technical Proposal?.

G.  Business Rules

1.0.  OFFERORS NEED NOT RESPOND TO ALL LINE ITEMS.  The offeror is free to respond to any or all of the line item requirements within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet on either/both tabs (Finished Job (Offeror Quality) and Finished Job (Govt Quality)).  The Government does request that the offeror provide a brief rationale for not responding (i.e. not a typical product line, not cost effective given the volume, etc).  This data would be helpful to determine the reasonableness of the Government?s ultimate approach/solution.

2.0.  These data are not binding on either the offeror or the Government.

3.0.  The Government has no additional information that is available at this time.  However, if a solicitation is issued, the Government realizes that additional detail and definitional support will be required.  Offerors are free to propose data, technical, definitional, business or other items that would be needed to competently propose on the Governments requirements.

4.0.  The Government will retain these data as long as necessary to complete its analyses.

5.0.  The Government will make no other use of this data, except for the analyses of the DoDs optical fabrication options.

H.  Proposal Submission Requirements

1.0.  The transmission and receipt of each offerors proposal from/to the Government will be exclusively electronic.  Hand written price proposals, brochures, paper price lists, etc. cannot be accepted because the Government will not be able to meet the deadlines established by higher authorities.  As this proposal has been sent electronically, the Government requires that the offeror?s proposals be received electronically.  They should be submitted to the point of contact below ONLY.  Please contact the point of contact below if there are any questions.

1.1.  Sales/marketing brochures are specifically discouraged.  Do not send samples.  Do not send items that need to be returned to the offeror.  Offerors should not feel compelled to prove either capacity or competence as these issues will be inherent in formal solicitations, if issued.  The Government encourages offerors to present certain sales, marketing or product data during their oral proposals, if they elect that option.

2.0.  Proposals are due by 2:00 EDT on 26 August 2002 to the point of contact below.  Although late proposals do not have the same implications as if this were a formal solicitation, this date has been chosen to meet deadlines established by the Surgeon General of the Navy, the Department of Defense and other budgetary and executive agencies of the President.  Therefore, the Government requests that this deadline be met as reasonably as possible.  Please contact the point of contact below if there are any questions.

3.0.  To supplement (not supplant) the offeror?s electronic data, the Government is willing to schedule time during the week of 26-29 August 2002 to hold oral discussions with offerors.  These oral discussions are completely optional at the discretion of the offeror and, at no cost to the Government.  If the offeror desires to provide an oral proposal, please contact the point of contact listed below to establish a mutually convenient time.

I.  Offerors Proposal

1.0.  Offerors should read and completely understand this document before beginning either their business or technical proposals.

2.0.  Business Proposal.  The Government recommends that offerors:

2.1.  Review the standards for interpreting the pricing requirements.  These standards are contained within the Microsoft Excel? spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Data on the tabs titled, Frame Data, Lens Data, and Tint Data.

2.1.1.  The, FY02 YTD Volume (Oct-Jun) column represents the workload that the offeror shall use for pricing purposes taking into account all expenses and discounts to propose a notional price for a finished optical job.  These numbers represent the Government?s workload from October 1, 2001 through Jun 30, 2002.  The offerer is reminded that references in the spreadsheets to lens volume indicates the per lens volume and not per pair volume.  The Government requests that the offeror indicates their pricing for lenses as per finished and mounted lens pair.

2.1.2.  The MIL-SPEC references, color, eyesize, bridge and, temple data have been provided to offerors as a reference of the range and depth of eyewear that are typically produced by the Government.

2.1.3.  The Vendor or source data for frames has been provided to give offerors an additional reference that can be used for pricing purposes.  The offeror may propose equivalent frame types as long as they meet the standards contained therein.  Offerors are neither required to use the same source nor contact these competitors.

2.2.  Complete the tab titled, Finished Job (Offeror Quality) within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet?.  These data should be the offerors notional prices to the Government for each finished optical job (as defined herein) using the offeror?s quality standards.

2.2.1  The data shaded in blue represents the Governments requirement by frame and lens type.  The Government believes that the offeror should be able to use the standards within the Microsoft Excel? spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Data? to provide a notional price to the Government.

2.2.2.  The offeror shall complete the green shaded cells.

2.3.  Complete the tab titled, Finished Job (Govt Quality) within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet.

2.3.2.  The offeror shall complete the yellow shaded cells.

2.4.  Provide any supporting financial documentation that the offeror believes that the Government needs to understand the offeror?s prices.  Information should be precise, factual and complete, avoiding unnecessary, unrelated, and/or expansive discussions.

3.0.  Technical Proposal. The Government requests that offerors:

3.1.  Provide a brief and general rationale for not responding to all line items as applicable to the offerors data.

3.2.  Provide proposals/ideas of data, technical, definitional, business or other items that would be needed to competently propose on the Government?s requirements if formal solicitations are issued.

3.3.  Provide any information regarding mailing costs that explains the timing and barriers of fabricating eyewear for the United States Army Medical Materiel Command Europe (USAMMCE), Pirmasens Germany; Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu HI; and, to the 16th MEDLOG Battalion, Taegu Republic of South Korea.  If mailing costs are available, the Government requests that the Contractor provide data for mailing 100 finished optical jobs using both the 24-hour and 3-day priority requirements.

3.4.  Provide a brief narrative regarding the offerors capability and/or willingness to manage the surge capability defined herein including capacities, time required to re-tool and, potential barriers to successfully satisfy both the Moderate and Short surge requirements.

3.5.  Provide the method that the offeror uses to transmit and receive eyewear requests from customers ONLY IF:

3.5.1.  The offeror cannot meet the Governments requirements for using a secure, strong encrypted digital method using Contractor provided hardware and or software or,

3.5.2.  The offeror receives more than 10% of orders via FAX, phone, or standard mail/courier services.

3.6.  Provide any supporting technical documentation that the offeror believes that the Government may need to understand the offeror?s proposal.  Information should be precise, factual and complete, avoiding unnecessary, unrelated, and/or expansive discussions.

J.  Evaluation Procedures

1.0.  To provide fair disclosure of the Governments use of these data, offerors are advised that the Government will make comparisons across like business items and among all offerors submitting a response to this RFI.  These data will be compared to the Government?s quality and cost data with particular attention to optical readiness and contingency planning.  While certain cost increases may or may not be justifiable, the Government cannot accept any plan that compromises or has the potential to compromise military optical readiness, current quality standards, current delivery standards (i.e. customer expectations) and/or the DoD?s ability to provide surge or contingency response.

2.0.  The identification of particular offerors and the content of their offers will be blinded.  Only the chairperson of the Technical Evaluation panel and the Contracting Officer will have specific identifying data as to which offeror proposed, the content of their proposal and the identification of questions, issues and/or concerns of offerors (to a practical extent).  Offerors suggestions may be made via attribute to follow up prior to any future procurement action.

<CONTACT>Joseph Comella, Contracting Officer , Phone (202) 366-9568, Fax (202) 366-9555, Email jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is posting a draft solicitation to the FedBizOpps Internet site (www.fedbizopps.gov ). The draft solicitation includes the statement of work, cost worksheets, evaluation criteria, instructions to offerors and partial contract sections. Written industry comments are solicited and should reference the specific solicitation section in question. Written comments should be sent via e-mail to jcomella@nhtsa.dot.gov no later than October 15, 2002. All comments received by that date will be considered, however, the Government reserves the right to issue the final solicitation, as it deems appropriate. Prospective offerors are cautioned not to rely on the information provided in the draft solicitation as being the same or similar to the information that will ultimately be issued as the formal Request for Proposal.   

This requirement is to support the National Driver Register's data processing and communications needs.  All of the NDR's technical and general support requirements for data processing and telecommunications network management as defined in the draft solicitation must be met.  The Government plans to issue a draft competitive solicitation using the SIC Code 7379 or the NAIC Code 514210 with a SBA Size Standard of $21 million.

The NDR capability is predicated on an IBM OS/390 system (currently version 2 release 10) with ACP/NCP, and RACF (or similar security) providing TSO and supporting IBM's CICS Transaction Server for OS/390 version 1 release 3 (See Section C.2.3.2).  The COBOL for OS/390 compiler is used to compile programs (batch and CICS).  The NDR does not intend to consider any alternative environments and, furthermore, requires support from a vendor who has at least one year's operating experience with TS 1.3 on the proposed system by the proposal due date.  This approach will facilitate the transition from the current timesharing environment to the new one.  

The NDR's current support is based on the use of an IBM 7060-H70 multiprise mainframe with two 100 MIP engines running under the OS/390, version 2 release 10, operating system.  An identical, equivalent, or faster mainframe that supports hardware data compression is required.  The vendor's mainframe must support NDR's estimated peak processing requirements as specified in Section C.3, Table C-2, and it must also be able to support NDR's response time requirements (see Section C.4.4).

This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. The draft solicitation for comments and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a WorldWide Web  (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or  www.eps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments  (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service (GSA-FTS) is issuing this sources sought notification in search of vendors that hold GSA Federal Supply Schedules that would allow them to perform services described herein.  This project is for the Naval Oceanographic Office located at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.   GSA FTS is only interested in vendors who 1) hold a GSA FSS Schedule; and 2) are located within 100 miles of Stennis Space Center, MS.

The project will consist of developing Digital Nautical Charts (DNC).  Digital Nautical Charts are digital vector based nautical charts intended primarily to support marine navigation using Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS).  A DNC is made up of libraries (General, Coastal, Approach, and Harbor).  These libraries are generally based on the scale of existing nautical charts.  Libraries are made up of tiles that vary in size based on the library.   A tile can be as large as 3 x 3 degrees (General, Coastal) or as small as 15 x 15 minutes (Harbor).  

DNCs are produced using Vector Product Format (VPF)* which is commonly used in other mapping, charting and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS).  All data is structured in accordance with the Vector Product Format Military Standard, MIL-STD-2407, 28 June 1996 and the Digital Geographic Information Exchange Standard (DIGEST) Part 4, Feature Attribute Coding Catalog (FACC).  Complete performance specifications of DNCs are contained in Military Specification MIL-D-85023 and its amendments.

Vendors are needed to perform all tasks necessary to produce specified Project from supplied GFI.  Vendors will be required to perform these tasks using CARIS ? Digest Object Manager (DOM) version 3.1 and CARIS ? GIS version 4.4.

If you feel your company meets the two criteria and can perform this requirement(s), please email a request for the sample dataset to john.mayes@gsa.gov, by August 30, 2002.  Please include a copy of your GSA Schedule and location information along with your request.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education, Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is seeking a contractor to review and evaluate the design and navigability of its Students.gov web site.  Students.gov,  the FSA-sponsored government-wide web portal for students, was launched in April 1999. Since its debut, the site has been enthusiastically received and its usefulness confirmed through awards and praise from the secondary, postsecondary and cyber communities. 

Almost two million visitors have visited the site since its launch over two years ago, beginning with 2,400 visitors in its first full month of operation to more than 97,000 visitors in July 2002. The students.gov web team has completed two major site redesigns in response to feedback from student focus groups and email feedback received through the site.  The site is fully accessible and compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Recognized both within and outside of government, students.gov serves as a model for customer-centered government web portals. James Vaughan of AOL's GovernmentGuide, speaking at the Department of Labor in May 2001, cited students.gov as an outstanding customer-centric website and stated, "This is what most government websites should be like."  AOL's GovernmentGuide continues to be a consistent supporter, and plans to actively promote students.gov in the coming year.

Students.gov received the Hammer Award in March 2000 and the E-Gov 2000 Trailblazer Award in May 2000; was featured in articles in FirstGov's "e-Gov News" in May 2001 and GSA's "Intergovernmental Solutions" in July 2001; was featured in the Scout Report (an influential website review newsletter directed at educators and librarians) in November 2000; received an "A+" rating from EducationWorld. Students.gov is prominently featured in AOL, Google, Yahoo, and many other commercial portals and search engines, and more than 2,500 other education-related websites link to students.gov.

Objective:

FSA wishes to review the current design and navigability of the students.gov web portal in light of the findings of recent focus groups, surveys, and usability studies, and evaluate various alternatives to increase its visual appeal and usability, while simplifying and maintaining its "portal" structure (which minimizes the number of mouse-clicks required for visitors to locate information).  The site design must remain tailored to the needs and interests of students and other site visitors and must comply with the accessibility requirements of Section 508. 

The underlying technical structure of the site will remain essentially the same.

Recommendations for design changes will build on the current structure, and will use the most cost-effective and efficient methods possible, assuming a very limited redesign budget.


Tasks to be Performed:

The contractor selected for this project shall review and evaluate the current design and navigation scheme, taking into account recent trends in web portals (especially federal web portals), and the results of recent focus groups, surveys, and usability studies of students.gov.  

Based on review and analysis of the current site design and visitor feedback, the contractor shall make recommendations for possible design and navigation changes to improve the usability of the site, prepare a written report presenting the findings and conclusions resulting from the design review, including technical and visual details of at least three different approaches for how to incorporate recommended design changes, and present the written report to FSA (either in person or by telephone).

Project Benefits:

Expert advice in reviewing the current site design and recommending enhancements will provide FSA with a better analysis and more cost-effective use of limited funds for site improvements.

Improving students.gov's design and navigability will further the Administration's e-Government goals by providing citizens with a more successful and pleasant experience, tailored to their needs - and this will encourage them to look to the web to obtain more government services.

Evaluation Criteria:

Proposals will be evaluated on the following measures:

1) Demonstrated familiarity with web portals, especially federal web portals.
				 
2)  Demonstrated understanding/experience with website design and usability concepts, including Section 508 accessibility.	

3)  Ability to communicate findings, conclusions, and recommendations clearly, in plain, non-technical English.

4)  Relevant experience and education of team (proposed staff).

Price. (The Government is seeking a firm-fixed price for this project, i.e., a single bottom-line price rather than a variable pricing arrangement such as an hourly rate or expendes.  The Government will only pay the firm-fixed price and will not reimburse the contractor for any costs incurred.)

Proposals should be no longer than ten (10) pages in length, including resumes (proposals over ten pages will be excluded from further review and evaluation).  Proposals must be received electronically no later than 5:00 p.m. on 8/30/2002 by  Lynda Folwick at lynda.folwick@ed.gov.

Questions on this request for proposals should be addressed to Lynda Folwick at  lynda.folwick@ed.gov or Deb Wrabley at deborah.wrabley@ed.gov.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-A10T34
<RESPDATE>092302
<ARCHDATE>10082002
<CONTACT>Catherine Contreras, Contract Specialist, Phone 804-279-6820, Fax 804-279-3715, Email Catherine.Contreras@dscr.dla.mil
<DESC>Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is in the process of preparing solicitations in support of competitive spare parts for the A-10 Aircraft/TF-34 Engine.  There will be one unrestricted solicitation and one solicitation set aside for small businesses.  Multiple awards will be made from each solicitation.  It is envisioned that the resultant contracts will be for a basic contract period of three years with two twenty-four month option periods and one thirty six month option period, for a total maximum period of performance of ten years.  The Government's goal in this program is to increase mission readiness levels by increasing stock availability, reducing contractor processing time, and reducing time on back order.  
Another DSCR objective is to use Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) for any items that, after evaluation of proposals, are determined by business case analysis to be provided more efficiently by contractor support.  It is envisioned that this procurement will allow offerors to indicate those items that they propose to provide via DVD.  The Government reserves the right to designate or recommend DVD items prior to solicitation.  DVD items are generally fast moving items that have many users, frequent demand, and varying quantities.  Under a DVD arrangement the contractor is responsible for providing a complete range of services to support the DVD items.  These services include: forecasting, purchasing, inventory management, quality control, receipt, storage, packing, and transportation.      
DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:  Performance metrics will apply to the resultant contracts.  At this time it is envisioned that within a period of one year after contract award, the following performance metrics will be used to evaluate contractor performance: 1.	CPT for DVD Routine Requisitions, within 5 days 95% of the time; 2. CPT for DVD High Priority Requisitions, within 2 days, 95% of the time; 3.Time on Backorder for DVD, maximum number of days 20, 95% of the time; and 4.CPT for DLA Stock, PLT for NSN, 95%. 
    DEFINITIONS:  CPT (Contractor Processing Time) is defined as the number of days from the delivery order issue date to the date that the total quantity ordered is shipped.
Time on Backorder is defined as the delivery order ship date minus the delivery order due date.
PLT (Production Lead Time) goal is negotiated on an NSN by NSN basis. 
    SURGE AND SUSTAINMENT:  In addition to the delivery metrics, Surge and Sustainment requirements do apply to some NSNs covered under this procurement.  A list of the covered NSNs can be found at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/proc/VPV/A10Air/a10air.htm.  For your information, sample Surge and Sustainment clauses can be found at the same web site.  
    SYSTEMS INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS:  Contractors may be required to interface with DLA's Standard Automated Materiel Management System (SAMMS) and Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS).  In this case the contractor must be capable of sending, receiving, and processing the ANSI X12 transaction sets (3050 implementation convention) 850 (Purchase/Delivery Order), 856 (Shipment Notice), and 997 (Functional Acknowledgement). An electronic mailbox on a DAASC certified Value Added Network (VAN) would also be required. Contractors may be required to interface with the Government's Global Transportation Network (GTN) to enable the government to track and trace contractor shipments.  

    NSN CATEGORIES:  The Government has divided the NSNs covered by the acquisition into (number) manufacturing categories.  Depending on the responses to this RFI, it is possible that the Government will make each category all or none, meaning that the contractor must propose and be able to provide all NSNs in the category in order to be considered responsive.  All NSNs listed in this RFI are categorized G (meaning that the Government has unlimited rights to the technical data of the NSN and the package is complete).  

    SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE:  DLA is setting aside those NSNs with a previous small business buy history for small business concerns.  As it is a goal of DSCR to aggressively seek small business participation, the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine if adequate small business capability and interest exist to justify the setting aside of additional NSNs that have not historically been supplied by the small business community.   In order to set the acquisition aside, DSCR must determine if two or more interested small businesses are capable of meeting the requirements outlined in this RFI.  

Although general information is provided in this RFI, contractors are strongly encouraged to review the draft Statement of Work.  The draft Statement of Work and a list of the NSN groupings, nomenclatures, annual demand values for the last four years, four quarter frequency, four-quarter quantity, and expected Production Lead Time (PLT) can be found at (http://www.dscr.dla.mil/proc/VPV/A10Air/a10air.htm).  

    INFORMATION SOUGHT:  To indicate an ability to meet the requirements of this potential acquisition, small businesses should submit the following general information to the address shown below NLT the closing date of this synopsis: 1.  Corporate Information to include an indication of type of Small Business (e.g. 8A, Hubzone, WOSB, SDVet, etc); 2. A list of the specific NSN groupings that your company is interested in and capable of providing;  3. Descriptions of your relationship with suppliers for make or buy parts.  In the case of buy parts, include a statement that the parts will be purchased from another small business manufacturing concern in accordance with FAR 19.502-2(c); 4.	NSNs for which you would be interested in providing DVD services; 5. Past experience in providing/manufacturing similar parts in support of Government or other similar contracts; 6. Comments on the NSN groupings.  If you recommend the addition/deletion of an NSN from a grouping, you must provide the rationale for doing so; and 7. Any other comments on the requirement.  Please be as specific as possible.

Responses to this RFI should be forwarded in Microsoft Word via e-mail to Catherine Contreras at Catherine.Contreras@dscr.dla.mil no later than 20 September 2002.   Industry is reminded that this is a Request for Information, not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Please do not submit a complete proposal with prices at this time.  

The Government reserves the right to structure the acquisition in any number of ways to enhance competition and optimize operational efficiencies.  Individual NSNs or groups of NSNs may be added or deleted as necessary to enhance competition.  The Government also reserves the right to add or delete any combination of services.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources and industry comments concerning equipment availability, operability and construction of a Ka-Band Station for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project SDO is the first mission under the Living with a Star (LWS) Program as part of the Sun Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing our understanding of the solar process and space weather.	SDO is viewed as a follow on to the highly successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105° longitude and having an inclination of 28.5°.  SDO will also have a mission life of 5 years. SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high rate data (150-200 Mbps) stream. The transmitted data will be SQPSK modulated at Ka-band carrier (25.5-27 GHz), and the EIRP from the spacecraft will be 44-50 dBW  The science and housekeeping data will be electronically distributed to the Science Operation Centers in real-time.  There will be a temporary data storage capability at each ground station for the purpose of buffering data in cases of equipment failure or other unforeseen problem on the ground. The SDO Project may procure for Ka-band ground stations that would meet the SDO requirements. However, there are some fundamental questions that need to be addressed. The questions are as follows:  1)	    What types of Ka-Band/RF manufacturers do you have experience with? 2)  What spacecraft missions have you supported at the Ka-band frequencies? 3)	What dish size would you recommend for SDO based on the information provided?  Assume the ground antenna must point to within its .25dB beam width.  (see attachment A:  downlink calculations for SDO) 4)      Will the Ka-band system handle various spacecraft transmitter designs?  Modulation format is expected to be Staggered Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (SQPSK).  What data formats are supported?	Are multiple simultaneous transmissions possible? 5)    Will a radome be required to assure pointing accuracy from White Sands location? 6)     State the pros and cons of a radome for Ka-band applications? 7)	What solar radio frequency interference issues may inhibit the effectiveness of your design? 8) What additional loss can be expected due to a radome? 9)	    What G/T can be expected, including losses to the LNA?     10)  What losses will be incurred when an S-band system is installed with the Ka-band system? 11)    Is diversity combining recommended for circularly polarized signal from a geosynchronous orbit? 12)	What's the maximum, reliable data rate, that can be Viterbi decoded with today's technology? 13)	    Will the SDO project be able to decode serially at our I/Q rates of up to 100/100Mbps rate .5 encoded? 14)	 What is the recommended service interval recommended for a Ka-band system? 15)  What additional cost would be incurred if automation were included in Ka-band system? 16)	  What costs would be incurred if 128Kbps, S-band, transmitter/receiver were co-located on antenna? Sources with information relevant to this notice are asked to respond by submitting a white paper of no more than ten (10) pages which conforms to attachment 1 entiltled , "Template For SDO Ka-band ground station".  The paper should clearly address a prospective of how to meet current SDO requirement of high, continuous data (150+Mbps) downlink rates.  Vendors should provide a rough order of magnitude of costs for such a system.	Comments and questions regarding this notice are encouraged and solicited. Responses should demonstrate the technical feasibility, operational robustness and reliability, and simplicity and straightforwardness for operators.   Vendors that have provided expertise in Ka-band ground stations with associated equipment are encourage to respond.	 Technical questions should be directed to:  Mr. Raymond Pages, SDO Ground System Manager, Code 581, Goddard Space Flight Center, Tel. (301) 286-6012, Fax (301) 286-0334, E-mail: Raymond.J.Pages.1@gsfc.nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to the point of contact listed below.

The carrier provides impedance matching of the received beacon LO signal from the gun fixed microwave oscillator to the hybrid module, which mixes the RF signal with the beacon LO signal.  Although the F-16 Logistics Operation Division does not have an immediate requirement, this notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  Interested parties may request a source qualification statement from Lt Mike Weinheimer at 801-775-4613 or Michael.weinheimer@hill.af.mil.
