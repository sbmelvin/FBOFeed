<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION. THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT. The High Power Microwaves Technologies Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (RD), Kirtland AFB New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave, millimeter wave, and other directed energy systems via this High Energy Research and Applications (HERA) program.
B. The HERA program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high energy research to include High Power Microwave (HPM), and millimeter wave system and technology development. This program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/RDH capital resources, facilities, and experience. This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power. In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D service and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities. Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory, the High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/RD, and portions of  other AFRL buildings. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR). As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive laboratory / facilities service and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.  Most contractor personnel will be required to have SECRET level clearances, and some must be clearable for access to RESTRICTED DATA, CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN INFORMATION, FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA, SCI, and Non-SCI.

C. The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $60-75M over five years.
 
FY08 - $12-15M; FY09 - $12-15M; FY10 - $12-15M; FY11 - $12-15M; FY12 $12-15M.

The resulting contract will be awarded with a not-to-exceed ceiling of $75M. This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards. This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area. If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order. If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: overall scientific and technical merits, importance to AFRL/RD programs; and affordability. AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation. Technical Areas are described below. 

TECHNICAL AREA 1. High Power Microwave Development: 

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW and average/continuous (CW) HPM systems capable of generating hundreds of kW to few MW are of interest to the HERA program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target. The thrust of this activity is to
--	Identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power, and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; also of interest are sources that can provide average/CW power of hundred of kW to few MW.
--	Execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results.
--	Downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results.
--	Coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred. 

Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Area 2 is expected. A further aspect of this technical area is to 
--	Investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development. Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere. Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits. 

TECHNICAL AREA 2. Theoretical and Computational R&D: 

The objectives of this technical area are to develop theoretical techniques and computational tools to:
--	Advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.
--	Conduct numerical analysis of such devices which typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types. Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.
--	Explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies. This task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.
--	Gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems. The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  
--	Conduct engagement level Model and Simulation (M&S) to address scale system requirements. For example, use of EADSIM to assess duty cycle impact on mission for airborne active denial.
--	Describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target." These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, and scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.
--	Determine scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.

TECHNICAL AREA 3. Pulsed Power (PP) and Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D: 

The goals of this technical area are to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems. This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/RD applications. The work under this Technical Area includes: 
--	Hardware design, fabrication, assembly, and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems. Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state). Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.

This Technical Area also includes the exploration and development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical areas. The scope of this effort includes 
--	Designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s). Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads. 

Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators. Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances. Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads. Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds. 

Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds. Pulse power systems work may include 
--	Fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics. 

This technical area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles. Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments. Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times. The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds. Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.
 
TECHNICAL AREA 4.  Prime Power: 

The goal of this technical area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems. This is an enabling technical area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains. Areas of research for this technical area include 
--	Design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like. 
--	Investigation and modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

TECHNICAL AREA 5.  Technology Demonstrator Development, Operation and Testing

The objective of this technical area is to develop a full scale prototype once a technology is identified for development.  This includes 
--	Conceptual studies, system designs, design drawings, fabrication of subsystems, system integration, engineering and technician support in servicing (including spares) and operating such prototype for purpose of testing and demonstration.  Emphasis should be placed on balancing risk, use of commercial of the shelf (COTS), state-of-the art and/or new subsystem technologies for full system design and development.   
--	Platforms to be considered for system integration and demonstrator development should include but not be limited to land and airborne systems.

TECHNICAL AREA 6.  System Integration and Demonstration

The objective of this technical area is to develop, simulate, fabricate, test, demonstrate, package and fully integrate HPM aerial and ground systems according to form, fit, and function requirements defined by AFRL/RDH using HPM technology. HPM technology includes but is not limited by, existing sources such as the Advanced Counter Electronic Source (ACES), or newly developed sources such at the Relativistic Magnetron (RelMag). The intentions of this task area are to deliver aerial and ground based HPM weapon systems to the end user that is close to an end product.  This task includes: 
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM system, military feasibility studies of the integrated package, system designs, fabrication of components to fabrication of the majority of the system, survivability studies, testing for EMI/EMC,  testing individual components, testing the overall system, operator manuals, engineering and technician support, and demonstrating the system in an operational realistic environment.
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems satisfying form and fit requirements of the end user by designing or replacing components with more efficient, smaller, or lighter technology. This fit requirement can also be satisfied by a redesign of the overall system or the redesign of the orientation of components to ensure the dimensions and weight is minimized.
--	For aerial systems safety of flight and SEEK EAGLE standards should be taken into account for design of the end product. Additionally, survivability, fusing methods, delivery of the platform to one or more three-dimensional points in space, and internal/external modifications to the aerial platform should be taken into account. Due to the nature of the aerial platform, an in-depth understanding of air platforms is required as well as requirements of the United States Air Force concerning these types of systems should be understood. The aerial platform options may include current munition type inventories and/or specifically designed systems for HPM payloads. 
--	For aerial HPM systems the delivery method includes fighter and/or bomber type aircraft. Detailed knowledge and understanding is required to successfully merge the aerial HPM system to the aircraft.
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the military feasibility studies is to determine the effectiveness and worthiness of the integrated system given the appropriate platform and HPM parameters. This includes studies of the effectiveness against targets sets such as centers of gravities and facilities with electronic systems. 
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the survivability studies is to ensure the continued nominal operation of the integrated system in the presence of extremes such as, but not limited to, vibration, pressure, and temperature. The survivability study shall take into account the platform of the integrated system. 
--	For both the ground and aerial HPM systems the goal of the demonstration phase is to validate military feasibility and worthiness against realistic target sets and collateral effects on subsystems in real world scenarios. The demonstration shall take into account the platform of the integrated system. Platforms considered for system integration shall include but is not limited to airborne and mobile ground based systems.

<DESC>Notice to Potential Offerors:

This is a DRAFT Solicitation.  The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM, The Government, or We) offers this draft request for proposals (RFP) to potential offerors.  We invite interested offerors to review and evaluate this document and provide meaningful responses to the concerns and questions listed below as well as provide your own questions and concerns.  

We wish to purchase the services described in the draft solicitation under terms and conditions similar to those that typically apply to similar services in the private sector. However, we have unique constraints and circumstances and we must ensure that the services we purchase meet these unique circumstances.   

OPM anticipates releasing the final RFP in June 2009. Upon release offerors will have 30 days to respond. We expect to make the final award in September 2009. 

Questions for Potential Offerors

OPM is specifically requesting responses to the following questions.  Please limit your response to 25 pages or less.   

1.	Please provide OPM with any requirement, constraints, or conditions that you view as potentially problematic or have the potential to disproportionately increase the price of the services that OPM is requesting in this RFP.

2.	In the final solicitation, OPM will restrict the number of pages allowed for technical proposal submissions.  Please review Section E-- Instructions to Offerors, and comment on whether the number of pages allotted are sufficient for a complete response to the solicitation.

3.	Please review the contract clauses and provide OPM with any potential issues that may arise due to a specific clause. 

4.	Please provide your analysis on the feasibility of being able respond to the CLINS and optional CLINS with a proposed solution and costs. 

5.	With respect to pricing, we wish to allow vendors flexibility in defining the structure of their offers while preserving comparability among offers.  Please review the pricing instructions in the draft solicitation (Section B), and comment on whether our form and structure provides you sufficient flexibility to define the elements of a solution in a meaningful way that will be manageable over the life of the contract.

6.	In your analysis of the optional CLINS, please address the following: 
a.	Do you agree with the proposed order or implementation?  What about the tentative timeline?  Why or why not? 
b.	For FEHB, what advice or suggestions do you have on phasing implementation?  By function (i.e., enrollment)?  By agency or payroll provider?  This may help us determine the appropriate CLIN structure.
c.	For decision support tools, 
i.	Should OPM seek a custom developed tool or a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) product?
ii.	Should OPM permit an offeror to submit a proposal for decision support tools only? 
iii.	Should OPM contract separately for decision support tools?
iv.	What is the appropriate basis to assess fees for decision support tools  number of eligible lives, number of covered lives, number of enrollees, or some other factor? 

7.	In the future, OPM may consider implementing a Spanish language version of the BENEFEDS Portal. Please review the requirements and provide your analysis on specific requirements OPM should consider in relation to a Spanish language site. Please also provide any specific technology or processes OPM would need to have in place in order to serve Spanish language customers via the Portal. 

8.	To keep pace with our growing customer base, and continue to provide cost savings to our customers, do you think BENEFEDS should consider collecting fees for paper based enrollments and/or telephonic enrollments? If yes, how would you implement / attach fees to paper and telephonic enrollments? If no, how would you keep cost down, and still provide paper and telephonic enrollment support without disproportionately effecting costs over time? 

9.	With regard to Acceptable Quality Levels (AQLs), would you provide a separate Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) for each program or could the same factors be used for all programs?

10.	With regard to Customer Service and Call Center support, how could you support OPMs desire for increased hours of operation and quality without increasing costs?  What ideas or recommendations do you have for providing service to our many employees and annuitants living and/or working overseas?  

11.	Do you have any recommendations or advise on data management and archiving?  How many years of information should be available to enrollees online?  Should the length of time vary by program?  

12.	Please provide OPM with any potential issues that may arise with providing a firm fixed price for the base year plus nine option years.  

13.	Please provide OPM with your thoughts on transition/implementation.  Should all services transition at the same time?  Can services be transitioned piecemeal on an as-ready basis?  

14.	  Please provide OPM with your thoughts regarding whether or not this requirement should be exempt from the Service Contract Act of 1965?

Note:  We are not requesting proposals at this time.  We are requesting your responses to the concerns/questions described above.   While it is not necessary that potential offerors provide responses to all of these questions, and offerors may still respond to the RFP even if they do not pose questions via the draft solicitation, OPM is interested in industry comments on this draft solicitation and encourages interested offerors to submit comments and questions.

3.	Past Performance

<DESC><p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) Governors (BBG) has a requirement that it intends to negotiate and award as a non-competitive commercial item contract to Scientific Atlanta 5030 Sugarloaf Parkway, Lawrenceville, GA 30042. The contract will include a base year with four option years, subject to the availability of funding. Under the contract, Scientific Atlanta, a Cisco company, shall provide Cisco Systems Power Vu encoder and decoder/receiver equipment and maintenance services including system installation and training of BBG operational staff. This contract with Scientific Atlanta is needed to avoid any interruption in the Agency's services that are considered mission critical, as there can be no break in services. This sole source procurement is being done in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 6.302-1(b)(4), 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), which permits other than full and open competition "when the agency head determined in accordance with the agency's standardization program that only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency's needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available." The Ageny standardized on Scientific Atlanta equipment in 1997 and has utilized and deployed Scientific Atlanta equipment throughout the Agency's Digital Video/Audio/Data Global Satellite and Fiber Cable delivery network. The equipment has proven very successful is providing high quality digital video, audio and data signals necessary to maintain the Agency's mission. In addition to over two thousand receiving units deployed worldwide, the Agency utilizes distribution systems in Washington DC, Miami, Kuwait, Prague, Tinang (Philippines), Cairo and other teleports. Changing to a new encoder/decoder system vendor would introduce incompatibilities in this proven design, requiring complete re-engineering of the system and jeopardizing the Agency's mission. Interested firms must submit adequate documentation of their capability to respond to this requirement in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days after the posting date of this notice. All documentation submitted shall be sufficient in depth and detail to allow for an evaluation without the need for added information. The Government will not accept oral or incomplete submissions. A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement will be based upon the response to this Public Notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government. All inquiries concerning this matter shall be submitted in writing to the point of contact, Myria Carpenter, who can be reached via E-mail at mecarpen@bbg.gov. This public notice is not an RFP, RFQ or IFB.</p>

GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>Components to be  integrated into the servers.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Western-Pacific Region has awarded a short-term 6-month single source contract to Lantz Security Systems, Inc. for the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) (ZLA) located in Palmdale, CA.  The award was issued as a single source procurement based on the need to meet critical dates.
A competitive solicitation was issued in January 2009 (DTFAWP-09-R-01099).  The solicitation was canceled in February 2009 because of the FAA's redefinition of security guard vendor qualifications.  At that point it was decided that there was not sufficient time to announce, solicit and award a new contract and have a new contractor procure weapons and qualify his employees in time to meet the start date of April 1, 2009.  Therefore, a short-term 6-month contract was awarded to the incumbent contractor on a single source basis in the amount of $407,476.20.  The period of performance is from April 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009.
The FAA is considering transferring the security responsibilities of this facility to the Department of Homeland Security/Federal Protective Service (FPS) effective October 1, 2009.  However, if the FAA decides not to affect the transfer to FPS on this date, a new competitive solicitation will be announced.
All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, James L. Travers at e-mail address james.travers@faa.gov or mailing address, FAA, Western-Pacific Region, WSA Acquisition Group - LA, AWP-052, P.O. Box 92007, Los Angeles, CA 90009-2007.

<p>The National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland is seeking a contractor with the capacity to provide on-going support for the Vaccine Branch, Center for Cancer Research, which will include investigations related to development of vaccines for prevention of retroviral infection, development of treatment strategies for AIDS, and elucidation of mechanisms of retroviral pathogenesis.</p>
<p>The proposed project will provide support in several areas including cell culture and virology, immunology, protein biochemistry and molecular biology. All these areas are critical to thorough study of retroviral pathogenesis and evaluation of candidate vaccines. A culture capability will provide for virus isolation and characterization, and development and expansion of viral stocks, critical for assessment of infection following challenge of vaccinated animals with live viruses, for studies of viral variation and evolution, for identification of novel viruses, and for provision of essential viral strains for use in vitro and in vivo. A virologic capability will provide support for pathogenesis studies and for determination of vaccine efficacy following challenge of immunized animals. An immunologic capability will provide support in evaluating seroprevalence of viruses of interest and immune responses elicited by candidate vaccines, and in determining immune parameters associated with protection from viral infection or disease progression. Numerous purified proteins and peptides are required in the study of retroviruses and retroviral vaccines, and these will be provided by the protein biochemistry segment of the contract. Molecular biologic capabilities will provide quantitative analytical support of vaccine and pathogenesis studies as well as direct provision of critical nucleic acid reagents including codon-optimized DNAs and plasmid DNA vaccines. In addition, the proposed project will provide long-term storage for viable cells and viruses.</p>
<p>The Contractor must meet the mandatory qualification criteria which require the Contractor to have biocontainment facilities (BSL2 with BSL3 practices) to conduct work with human retroviruses and non-human primate retroviruses (HIV, SIV, SHIV, SIV), adenoviruses and poxviruses. The contractor must also be able to supply fresh, viable cells and biologically active purified proteins to the Government within one hour after harvest or preparation.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a recompetition of contract No. N02-RC-47703 currently held by Advanced Biosciences Laboratory of Kensington, Maryland. It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement, completion type contract for a period of up to five years (one base plus four options) will be awarded.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to develop and demonstrate technologies to detect/locate, access, diagnose/identify, render safe/neutralize, and dispose of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnance (UXO). An IED is a device placed in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It can include military stores, but normally is devised from non-military components. White papers/full proposals for exploratory development are sought in the following areas:
1)IED Detection and LocationThis area focuses on technologies that can detect and/or locate the presence of an improvised explosive device. This may include buried, obscure and/or items out in the open. An IED may contain multiple elements, including explosives or other energetic materials, the case/housing, RF components, fragmenting materials, etc. constructed from military-grade and/or commercial/household items. It may also include person-borne, suspect packages or objects, and vehicle-borne threats. Technologies can address only "part" of the problem. Detection of each part of an IED has its own unique challenges. Emphasis would be placed on the following areas:
      a.Explosive Detection: This effort is to improve on current explosive detection (indicates an explosive is present) technologies for trace (non-visible amounts), small bulk (small visible amounts) and large bulk requirements (vehicles). Emphasis would be placed on technologies/systems with stand-off capabilities and/or potential to integrate with EOD robots for larger amounts of explosives.  Threats include person-borne (PBIEDs), parcel/package and vehicle-borne VBIEDs using military, commercial and Home Made Explosives (HME).
      b.RF/Electronics Component Detection: This effort focuses on detecting obscured electronic or RF components of interest. The threat could be close-up as in a suspect package or required at stand-off distances in the case of roadside bombs (Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs), underbelly attacks, buried caches).
      c.Casing or Fragment Detection: This effort focuses on improving the capability of detecting and locating the metal content in the IED. This may be on a PBIED in the form of frag, in a buried military round in a roadway, through concrete barriers, etc.
      d.Other Novel Approaches: Any other technologies that can detect/locate IEDs using some other characteristics or components not mentioned above: change detection, IR signatures, soil disturbances etc.
      e.Long Range Camera Detection: Terrorists will often try to videotape EOD technicians while they are performing their mission in order to study the techniques used by EOD.  The goal of this effort is to develop a technology for detecting the presence of operating video cameras at a distance of at least 100 meters.  Additionally this technology should be able to provide a compass bearing, as well as height (in case of multi-story buildings) and distance estimate to aid in locating the camera.   
2)IED Diagnose and Identification This area focuses on the identification of explosive materials used in or in the manufacture of an improvised explosive device's firing train, as well as the improved technologies to identify and assess an improvised explosive device.    
      a.Explosive Identification/Confirmation: This effort is to improve on current explosive (indicates what kind of explosive is present) and industrial chemicals and materials identification (indicates the chemicals/compounds used in the manufacture of explosives) technologies for trace (non-visible amounts), small bulk (small visible amounts) and large bulk requirements (VBIEDs). Emphasis would be placed on technologies/systems with stand-off capabilities and/or potential to integrate with EOD robots. Requirements for technologies that can identify home-made explosives, precursors and military/commercial grade explosives are required also.
     b. Radiation/Biological/Chemical Detection/ Identification: This effort focuses on improving technologies used in the detection and location of IED's. Once the detection and location of an IED is confirmed, the EOD technician must diagnose the type and condition of the item. This technology would allow that function to happen properly.
3)IED Render Safe/ NeutralizeThis area focuses on new information/capabilities that can be used to neutralize improvised explosives devices.      
     a.	Fuze Sensitivity:  In order to lay the ground work for potential future IED detection and defeat technologies, it is important to better understand how IEDs react to their environment.  This effort is to improve/increase the information available regarding the impact of a variety of stimuli such as RF, light, acoustic,  and radiation on IED fuzing electronics in order to look for potential reactions. 
     b.	Alternative Disruption Technologies:  A need exists for disruptors that do not generate sparks or has the logistical trail associated with explosives or smokeless powder.   Additionally, the projectiles utilized by current disruptors tend to be either solid projectiles, or water charges. There is the potential that other materials such as visco-elastic materials, which can behave like either a solid or a liquid depending upon stress conditions, may provide an enhanced capability for already fielded disruptors.  EOD would benefit from research into the behavior of such materials when used as a disruptor charge.
4)IED Access/ExploitComputed Tomography (CT) Scanner:  With the advent of 3-D printer technology (i.e. - stereolithography), there is the potential for EOD technicians to conduct a CT scan of a recovered device, the data from which could then be used to exploit or generate replicates of the original device.  Additionally, CT technology could potentially be used in a manner similar to how an x-ray system is used today in order to create a 3-D model for use by EOD technicians in the field. This effort would focus on exploring the potential uses of smaller, more portable CT systems and conversion of acquired data for input into 3-D printer technologies.
5)Detection/Location of Buried  MunitionsStandoff Detection of Buried Munitions This effort is to develop and demonstrate a system with the capability for stand-off detection and classification of buried UXO in real time and to increase current detection and discrimination of buried UXO. The purpose of this technology should provide extended detection depth, decrease the false alarm rate during UXO surveys and have the ability to discriminate ordnance targets from non-ordnance targets.  The effort should culminate in a man-portable and user-friendly system and will serve as the functional and procedural prototype of a production system.
6)Diagnostics/Identification of Buried MunitionsIdentification of Buried UXO   This effort is to develop new or improved technologies to identify buried munitions from cultural and geophysical anomalies. The focus will be to improve on discrimination from clutter.   
7)Render Safe/Neutralization of Surface or Buried Munitions This effort is to develop a technology to render-safe ordnance that has been identified but has not been accessed.  
New Technologies to render safe/neutralize UXO:  This effort is to develop new technologies such as directed energy systems for the purpose of neutralizing or rendering safe UXO.  The emergent threat of firing devices which may use modern electronics, lasers, etc. extremely limit EOD personnel's ability to render safe these items by only mechanical disruption. Development of render safe procedures and new tools based on new technologies to counter these threats will provide increased capability and reduce risk to EOD personnel during and after render safe procedures.
8)Render Safe/Neutralization of Surface or Buried Munitions This effort is to develop technology to improve the ability for EOD missions to be performed remotely using unmanned ground vehicles.a. New Technologies for the Modeling and Simulation of Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles:   Modeling and simulation (M&S) has become a critical capability in the deployment of unmanned ground vehicles over the past several years. M&S offers the ability to train EOD technicians offline, develop and test engineering design concepts, and assess human factors considerations. Although there are a number of commercially available M&S technologies on the market, there remain several capability gaps that limit the effectiveness of these tools.  	NAVEODTECHDIV is interested in addressing one of these gaps, namely, the capability to accurately model, in real time, vehicle terrain interaction for small wheeled and tracked unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) under 1000 lbs as they traverse multiple terrains (grass, sand, mud, snow, hardpan, pavement, etc.). Current research in terrain mobility models has focused on very high-fidelity models that apply to one terrain at a time, usually require significant computation time, and were typically validated for much larger wheeled vehicles. The goal for this project is to achieve sufficient realism to capture the macroscopic behavior of an actual vehicle as it traverses multiple terrains. Proposed solutions must handle vehicle crossovers between different terrains. Modeling the deformation of the terrain is not a requirement for this application, although solutions that include this capability will also be considered. Empirical studies using actual UGVs may be required to validate the terrain mobility models. Solutions should be optimized for real-time computation on modern multi-core architectures and/or general purpose computing architectures. The provided software solution should be modular and capable of interfacing with a third-party multibody simulation package.
b. New Technologies for Wireless Radio Frequency (RF) Command and Control for EOD Unmanned Ground Vehicles. Robust wireless command and control is essential to enabling remote EOD operations using unmanned ground vehicles.  This effort is to develop improved waveforms and associated radio technologies optimized for the teleoperation of EOD unmanned ground vehicles.  During teleoperation, robust bi-directional data and low latency, high resolution video is required.  The ability to operate Non-Line-Of-Sight in urban environments, inside buildings, and in the presence of interference out to distances of 1 km is desirable.  Waveforms developed as part of this effort should have the ability to be ported to Software Defined Radios (SDR) manufactured by multiple vendors.

<SOLNBR>HHS-BARDA-09-32
<CONTACT>Kim L. Hall, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-205-1587, Fax 202-205-6061, Email kim.hall@hhs.gov - Schuyler T Eldridge, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-1554, Fax 202-205-6061, Email schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov
<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. Continuous outbreaks of human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses from infected birds have occurred since late 2003 in Asia, Europe and/or Africa. Ongoing influenza surveillance reveals that H5N1 viruses are endemic in bird populations and suggests that continued human exposure is likely. As a result, the threat of a pandemic caused by highly pathogenic influenza viruses continues.
	
The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. HHS has undertaken a portfolio matrix approach to modernize and diversify influenza vaccines and to expand domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing surge capacity. Specific measures were implemented that support advanced development of cell-based influenza vaccines and antigen-optimization approaches for pandemic influenza vaccines, stockpiling of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and building of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing infrastructure.  

HHS now seeks to leverage recombinant-based technologies to decrease the timeline of vaccine production in response to a newly emerged pandemic influenza strain. The timeline for the availability of egg- and cell-based inactivated pandemic influenza vaccines in the U.S. is estimated at 20-23 weeks post-pandemic onset, which may be towards the end of a first pandemic wave. Recombinant influenza vaccines, on the other hand, may benefit from manufacturing efficiencies, may not be dependent on pandemic influenza virus reference strain availability and/or the production and calibration of potency assay reagents needed for inactivated influenza vaccines. As a result, recombinant influenza vaccines may be available in a shorter time frame of 8 to 12 weeks post-pandemic onset. The effect of vaccination combined with influenza antiviral drugs and community mitigation measures may delay the peak incidence of pandemic influenza disease and reduce mortality and morbidity during a severe pandemic.        
           
The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple contract awards to develop recombinant influenza vaccines based on hemagglutinin genes or proteins (plasmid DNA, virus-vectors, peptides, subunit proteins and virus-like particles) and leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds include clinical investigation lot manufacturing, scale-up process development, clinical evaluation, validation of manufacturing process systems and manufacturing facility concept design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or have partnerships with companies owning vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Other requirements for offerors include the following: (1) a completed final report of Phase I clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity using a recombinant influenza  vaccine (2) written evidence of firm commitment to establish and maintain the necessary facilities in the U.S. to manufacture bulk and final container recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine with a manufacturing surge capacity of 50 million doses within six months, (3) a manufacturing production cycle that permits recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine lot release within 12 weeks of a pandemic declaration. (4) a comprehensive development plan and timeline for U.S licensure of a recombinant pandemic-like influenza vaccine.

The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. The solicitation, (RFP HHS-BARDA-09-32) will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about May 31, 2009.  Proposals will be due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses to this notice should be identified with RFP HHS-BARDA-09-32, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the contracting office address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of October 30, 2009.  This requirement will be full and open competition for both large and small business.  Small businesses are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U. S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA on behalf of the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs has a requirement for biomedical translational efforts. This is an opportunity for the Government to provide contracted funds towards ongoing Independent Research and Development (IRAD) efforts by an offeror via a Contract Research and Development (CRAD). The program objective of the Biomedical Translational Initiative is to fund the demonstration and validation of innovative technologies to improve the clinical outcome of wounded warriors. The program seeks technologies to restore the wounded warrior to active duty, restore the wounded warriors form or function, or assist the wounded warrior in reclaiming their independence in daily living tasks. In general, this program facilitates the process which leads from evidence-based medicine research to sustainable solutions for public health problems.  The number of awards will be consistent with the agencys RDT&E budget and the number of anticipated contracts.  All winning proposals will be funded under negotiated contracts. The firm fixed price or cost plus fixed fee type contract will be used depending on the cost accounting practices of the offeror and the risk assessed by the Government. It is anticipated that contracts will be for a base period (Phase I) and an option period (Phase II). The estimated potential total values of all contracts combined is $20M. An option period may be exercised at the discretion of the Government before expiration of the previous period. The estimated start date is July 2009. This procurement will be under full and open competition. Technologies to address the following areas are of interest under this acquisition: Inflammation, infection and healing; blood substitutes; compartment syndrome; massive tissue loss; burns; and the interplay between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of the program is to fund the demonstration and validation of innovative technologies (integrated systems based on any combination of hardware, software, pharmaceuticals, biologics, and surgical methods) to improve the clinical outcome of wounded warriors. Technologies appropriate for demonstration and validation are sufficiently mature such that all required laboratory, pre-clinical and other proof-of-concept work have been completed and a functioning prototype has been developed prior to submission of a proposal. The government anticipates the Request For Proposal (RFP) will be released on or about May 15, 2009.

<CONTACT>Linda D. Vanish, Phone (310) 653-3777, Email linda.vanish@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Global Positioning Systems Wing intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price type contract with a schedule incentive to The Boeing Company. This action is to provide an Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) Positional Training Emulator (PTE) to the 533rd Training Squadron (533TRS), 381st Training Group located at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). The PTE is a high-fidelity crew trainer used to train Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) "combat mission ready" crews to operate GPS Block IIA, IIR/IIR-M and IIF satellites in either crew or positional modes. It utilizes a slightly modified version of the operational AEP software, as well as, the Block IIR and Block IIF Space Vehicle (SV) flight software to provide a highly realistic training environment that is nearly identical to the AEP ops floor. It can accurately run hundreds of the GPS operational checklists without modification and accurately simulate the behavior of a constellation of GPS satellites or an individual satellite.</p>
<p>Headquarters Air Education and Training Command (HQ AETC) and HQ AFSPC have recently approved a new operational requirement to have a PTE at VAFB. They would like the VAFB PTE to be operational within 3-5 months from time of contract award to support the 533TRS mission to provide AEP initial qualification training (IQT). As it is now, the GPS program replaced the existing legacy system in September 2007 and provided the 1st AEP PTE to the 50th Space Wing (50SW) for unit qualification training (UQT) and recurring crew training last fall. However, the program did not upgrade the existing legacy system Crew Training Emulator (CTE) at VAFB to support AEP IQT. This has shifted the burden of providing AEP IQT to the 50SW; a second PTE is urgently needed to correct this situation. In addition, installation of a second PTE at VAFB will allow HQ AETC and HQ AFSPC to expand the current GPS Basic Operator course to meet the 50SW Ops Group commander's intent that new GPS crew members coming from 533TRS will need little or no additional training before they can work on the AEP ops floor.</p>
<p>The Government has been contracting with The Boeing Company to provide GPS IIF SVs and upgrade the existing GPS Operational Control Segment (OCS). The Government believes Boeing is uniquely qualified to provide the second PTE because: 1) no reprocurement documents, drawings or training and training materials were delivered under the original PTE development effort, 2) the second PTE must be backward compatible with the first PTE to minimize future upgrade costs, and 3) as developers of the original PTE, they are already familiar with the tasks associated with creating another PTE. As a result, Boeing is considered the only responsible source that can provide the following supplies and services without the Government incurring substantial duplication of cost that are not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)). The GPSW is performing a market survey to determine if there are interested and qualified firms having the capability described below.</p>
<p>Under the basic effort, the contractor shall deliver a second PTE to VAFB and run a comprehensive PTE acceptance test, provide a Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) package to accredit the PTE for operations, present PTE operator training to 533TRS GPS training instructors, and provide PTE maintenance training to AETC maintainers to facilitate sustainment of the VAFB PTE. Under the optional sustainment portion of the contract, the contractor shall provide PTE system administration, org-level maintenance, and technical support to the 533TRS, if required on an "as needed" basis. The government's estimate of the contract award including options is approximately $5,000,000. This sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and in no way shall be considered as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>Note 22: NAICS Code&nbsp;336414 - Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing</p>
<p>All responsible sources (including Small and Small, Disadvantaged Businesses) may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) which will be considered. Oral communications are not acceptable. The SOC must include the following information: 1) company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers; 2) business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) experience in GPS satellites or similar technologies; 4) ability to satisfy the government's performance and schedule requirements described above; and 5) the facilities to work at the SECRET security level (as the PTE is a classified training system). Proprietary information must be expressly identified in the SOC. Only U.S. owned companies resident within the continental United States or its territories will be considered.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis should be submitted via email in MS Word 2000 or newer format or PDF format to Linda.Vanish@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to GPSW/PK, Attn: Linda Vanish, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. All responses are due no later than&nbsp;02 May 2009 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12-point, with a maximum of 20 pages. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Submission of the firm's SOC will be for informational purposes only. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information nor shall any costs be allowed on any Government contract.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentially as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the source selection process.

<SUBJECT>Intelligent and Automated Construction Job Site Testbed Sensor Network
<SOLNBR>AMD-09-SS39
<RESPDATE>050409
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The NIST Construction Metrology and Automation Group requires a Sensor Network to support experiments in the Intelligent and Automated Construction Job Site (IACJS) testbed.   The IACJS testbed will enable standardized, repeatable testing and evaluation of new construction methods, processes, and information and automation technologies.  It will employ modular packages of sensing, communication, control, and simulation equipment.  For example, the testbed environment will include the ability to measure the position and orientation of construction personnel, equipment, and components with relatively tight tolerances and to integrate that information with outside applications or virtual simulations.  Capturing such performance information is a critical step in the process of developing the enabling measurement science for Breakthrough Improvements in Construction Productivity.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an IACJS Sensor Network that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

To support these described capabilities an IACJS Sensor Network will be developed and installed within the IACJS Testbed. The Sensor Network will comprise six commercial items.  These include:  

(1)	A large-scale, real-time, laser pseudolite-based tracking system providing sub-centimeter position uncertainty of multiple receivers simultaneously. 

(2)	A network of passive high-resolution 2D cameras with calibrated spatial positions (a.k.a. Calibrated Camera Network) and orientations that provides centimeter-level 3D position uncertainty for real-time tracking of personnel, equipment, or materials down to a brick-sized object at a 20 m range.  

(3)	A 6-DOF laser tracker system to enable sub-millimeter, real-time tracking of the position and orientation of construction equipment, components, and robots, which can be used as ground truth for static and dynamic performance testing. 

(4)	An elevated platform (i.e., stage truss) that provides a stable structure for positioning sensors along elevated perimeter points around the testbed.  Perimeter dimensions are 15 m x 16 m.  The truss is expected to be hard-mounted to the concrete wall of the IACJS testbed lab at an elevation of approximately 7 m.

A 6-DOF moving platform for mounting sensors and targets that allows sub-centimeter level static and dynamic positioning within a large working volume (e.g., 10 m x 10 m x 5 m).  The platform is expected to be a variant of the NIST RoboCrane (likely TETRA configuration; reference the following MEL website: http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/projects/robocrane/)

(5)	 The 6-DOF robotic platform will enable performance evaluation of sensing and control algorithms for automated construction component placement.  The platform will also provide repeatable movements for evaluating the real-time performance of localization systems used to track personnel, equipment, and materials, and to study automated placement of construction components.  The platform will have to grasp, transport, and place a steel beam (~ 450 kg).

(6)	A command center at which sensors and equipment can be controlled and sensor data collected, processed, analyzed, visualized, and archived. The command center will also allow all testbed activities to be monitored and recorded.  Expectations are that this will be an integrated system of high performance computers and recording peripherals.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Submissions from sources for individual components or complete system integrators are welcome.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture these types of systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

Title: Geologic Mapping Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, California The National Park Service (NPS) has undertaken a Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) of 270 natural area park units. Santa Monica National Recreation Area is included in these 270 areas.  
The contractor must be capable of producing a digital geologic map, defined as a map that depicts the geographic distribution at the Earth's surface of bedrock and/or surficial geologic materials and structures, on a published base map showing topography, hydrography, culture, cadastral, and other base information.  Digital geologic maps may also contain a great variety of point data for specific sites, creating a 3-dimensional database, where applicable.  A geologic map generally includes an explanation, description of map units and symbols, cross sections, and a variety of other information.  Geologic maps produced under this contract must meet those standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2004 STATEMAP program announcement No. 04hQPA0003.    This document can be found online at http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/STATEMAP/index.html.
The park covers fourteen 7  minute quadrangles, including two on the east half of the Santa Barbara 1:100,000 quadrangle and 12 on the Los Angeles 1:100,000 quadrangle.  The contractor will produce a single, compiled geologic map of the entire SAMO unit based upon new mapping where necessary and the compilation of existing maps of the same scale that may already be published.  Inconsistencies among published and new maps must be rectified with seamless edge matching provided in the finished product.  
Additionally, the park experiences recurring landslides that impact park natural resources and infrastructure.  The contractor will provide a compiled landslide map database that seamlessly covers the entire park and depicts landslides that have been previously mapped by the California Geologic Survey and others on the fourteen 7 1/2 minute quadrangles that comprise the park.  These maps may be generated through interpretation of landforms as observed on maps, aerial photographs, and in the field. Each landslide on these maps must be described in terms of its activity, type, confidence of interpretation, direction of movement, and estimated thickness. 
An accuracy assessment (peer review) must be conducted to validate the final maps. 
Period of Performance for the entire project (all quadrangles mapped) is 24 months from award. 
Final map products will include: "	Digital geologic map, preferably in ESRI ArcGIS 9.x or latest version; personal geodatabase (.mdb) for each digital geologic-GIS map with a Geologic Unit Information table and Source Map Information table, where applicable.  At a minimum, all geologic features present on the published map(s) are present as GIS data, and are fully attributed shape files to standards as identified in Part I d of the USGS-NCGMP 2004 STATEMAP program announcement No. 04hQPA0003"	Accompanying text and graphics containing map explanatory information, "	A description of map units; "	A stratigraphic column depicting stratified units;"	Where applicable, a correlation diagram showing age relationships of map units;"	An explanation of map symbols; and"	FGDC compliant metadata for all files developed.
These may be delivered via CD-ROM or by file transfer protocol (ftp), or some other suitable agreed upon electronic medium.
Experience in the USGS STATEMAP requirements is required  as well as experience in geologic and landslide mapping in or near Ventura and Los Angeles Counties.
Depending on the responses, this may become a small business set aside.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICEHAZARD RANKING SYSTEM AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST TECHNICAL SUPPORT 
This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms,  Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR ? 121.104) possess the capability to support EPA?s Hazardous Ranking System (HRS) and National Priorities List (NPL) requirement.  Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.
The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government?s evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).
DESCRIPTION
The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns for EPA?s Hazard Ranking System and National Priorities List Technical Support.  EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able provide the technical and analytical services to provide support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA?s) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI) in assessing and implementing National Priorities List (NPL) activities.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), enacted on December 11, 1980, as amended, established broad authority for the Government to respond to problems posed by releases or threats of release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.  Responsibilities under CERCLA include:  Section 104, Response Authorities; and Section 105, National Contingency Plan.
CERCLA required the Federal Government to establish criteria for setting priorities among releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. EPA responded by developing the Hazard Ranking System (HRS), a scoring system which serves as the primary decision tool for determining which sites are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). The HRS evaluates four pathways of exposure: groundwater, surface water, soil exposure, and air.  For each pathway, the HRS evaluates: (1) the likelihood of release to the media, (2) characteristics of waste (toxicity, quantity, etc.), and (3) targets (actual or potentially exposed receptors).  Sites that score 28.5 or greater are eligible for placement on the NPL. The NPL is EPA?s list of priority hazardous waste sites.  Sites on the NPL are eligible for Federal funding to perform remedial actions.
For the purposes of this sources sought, the site assessment process consists of the evaluation and the placement of sites on the NPL.  After discovery, the site is evaluated by the regions, States, or Federal agencies by a preliminary assessment (PA).  A PA is an initial screening of the site in which all available data (e.g., past industrial activity, permit history, location of drinking water intakes) are collected and reviewed.  If warranted by the PA, a site inspection (SI) is conducted.  A SI involves on-site work that usually includes collection and analysis of suspected contaminated soil, surface water, groundwater, and air samples.  In many instances, integrated assessments, which combine activities of the PA, SI, and removal assessment, are conducted at sites.
If warranted by the SI, the site is formally evaluated for placement on the NPL.  To determine an HRS score, all of the data gathered during the PA and SI stages are analyzed using the HRS.  The HRS packages?documentation of the Agency's rationale, data, scoring procedures, overall score, and references?are prepared by the States, EPA regions, Headquarters contractor, and other participants in the NPL process.  The packages are submitted through the regional EPA offices to OSRTI.  The OSRTI NPL coordinator for each EPA region reviews the initial submission of a site package to ensure basic quality control standards are met.  If they are, the HRS package is forwarded to the contractor to provide support by performing a detailed quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) review and analysis.  After QA/QC reviews are completed, sites with an HRS score of 28.5 or greater are eligible for proposal to the NPL.  For those sites determined to be appropriate for NPL listing, the HRS packages are placed in the Superfund docket for public review when the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register.
Placing sites on the NPL is a two-stage process.  First, sites are proposed to the NPL, and a 60-day comment period follows.  The public comments on proposed sites are evaluated for technical accuracy and policy issues, and detailed responses are prepared. Second, following analysis and response to the public comments, sites still meeting the scoring criteria are placed on the NPL via a final rule.  After a final rule, a period of 90 days is allowed for the public to file legal challenges to the Agency?s decision to place the sites on the final NPL.
The Site Assessment and Remedy Decisions Branch (SARDB) in OSRTI is responsible for discovering sites, evaluating their potential threat to human health and the environment, implementing the HRS, proposing and adding them to the NPL and maintaining public information regarding these activities via the web and other OSRTI data systems.  A key component of implementing the HRS is evaluating exposure pathways, including surface and groundwater contamination.
ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE)
The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is:?	18,000 hours per year for a five (5) year contract?	18,000 hours per year for two (2) one (1) year award terms?	10,000 hours per year optional quantities ordered in increments for each year of the contract and each award term.  (Maximum potential LOE of 28,000 hours per year, with a maximum potential seven (7) year LOE of 196,000 total hours)
CAPABILITY STATEMENT:
To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft SOW. The Government requests demonstration of capability by interested parties through submittal of capability statements. The government will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft SOW.
All capability statements must:
1.	Not exceed and will be restricted up to ten (10) single-sided pages in length.2.	Be electronically submitted to the email address below by the stated deadline.3.	Include small business classification(s): (Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.) 4.	Address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to: (a) the key task areas in the draft SOW; and (b) the overall business demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules. 5.

State the (a) average number of employees of the concern; (b) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; (c) other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.); and (d) a description of the concern?s accounting system for estimating and accumulating costs under cost-reimbursement contracts?and whether or not those system(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.7.	Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability to meet the needs of the anticipated level of effort and scope of this requirement.  Note that any resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting.
The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive capability statements when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting RFP(s). The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps and EPA's website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm., under the ?Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) and Hazards Ranking System (HRS) Technical Support? link.

<CONTACT>Dr. Clifford Bedford, Email clifford.bedford@navy.mil - Mr. Garry Perkins, Email garry.perkins.ctr@navy.mil
<DESC>A major challenge today is to provide the Services with the next generation of energetic materials and concepts (explosives, propellants, and reactive materials) to enable substantially higher performance ordnance with acceptable insensitivity characteristics. The Office of Naval Researchs (ONR) Energetic Materials Program goal is to develop technologies which, when inserted into ordnance/propulsion systems, will increase system performance by 2-10 times while meeting insensitivity compliance objectives.

Over the past five years, investments in new polymer systems, mono-propellants, metal fuels (hydrides), ionic salts (both liquids and solids) as well as a wealth of high nitrogen and heterocyclic energetic materials have been studied and evaluated. While successfully meeting many of the Navys ordnance objectives, a new program is proposed to conceive, synthesize, characterize and scale new oxidizer ingredients which are superior to ammonium perchlorate (AP).

It is desired that all new ingredients will approach or surpass the oxygen content of AP. It is also hypothesized that the synthesis pathways developed for these new oxidizers will yield numerous mono-propellant compounds that can be evaluated as potential HMX (Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine)or RDX (Hexhydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) replacements.

This is not a solicitation for proposals. Ideas and sources only are being sought. No awards will be made as a result of this Request for Information. ONR will not be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. If sufficient feedback is received and a program is created, a separate Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be utilized for the collection of proposals.

<DESC><p>Scanning Probe Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy System</p>
<p>EMSL will be developing an instrument for spectroscopic infrared vibrational near-field nanoimaging that provides ultrahigh spatial resolution down to 10 nm, vibrational spectral information in the 700 to 5000 cm-1 (14 to 2 &#61549;m) range, sensitivity down to the molecular level, and applicability under ambient and environmental conditions. The system will consists of a modified scanning probe microscope with variable sample temperature stage integrated into an optical setup with IR radiation directed by reflective optics onto the metallic tip of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. The tip-scattered radiation will be detected in the backscattering direction and the near-field signal is extracted from the barf-field background by lock-in detection of the synchronized signal component with the tip dither frequency - preferably at a higher harmonic frequency to provide enhanced contrast due to the nonlinear distance dependence of the optical tip-sample coupling.</p>
<p>The instrumentation will consist of a scanning tunneling microscope/atomic force microscope (STM/AFM), a laser system with average power of ca. 1 mW (continuous wave, quasi-continuous wave, i.e., pulses with high repetition rate), and tunability over a broad IR wavelength scale, and optics. The STM/SFM will be a commercial instrument and the laser system will consist of a coherent frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 laser (532 nm), a coherent femtosecond oscillator, a coherent optical parametric oscillator (OPO), an autocorrelator and supplementary optics for OPO, difference frequency generation (DFG) components and nonlinear optical crystals.<br />Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:</p>
<p>1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.</p>

<DESC><p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide:
<p>Helium Ion Microscope</p>
<p>Helium ion microscope is an advanced technique based on a revolutionary, atomic size, gas field ion source. This capability is currently not available at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), a Department of Energy (DOE) national scientific user facility located at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The ion probe offers a number of unique capabilities. This includes (1) the highest recorded spatial resolution (down to 0.25 nm) for secondary electron imaging, (2) the ability to examine non-conducting samples (primarily biological samples) without a need for conductive coatings, and (3) topographic features being focused simultaneously over a depth range. With increasing research efforts on high aspect ratio nanostructures and biological samples from the user community and our clients, we desire an instrument with a larger depth-of-field than that offered by the conventional scanning electron microprobe (SEM). In addition to the high-quality imaging, we also require a capability of performing Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) with a nanometer or sub-nanometer beam size. A local, non-destructive (relatively) compositional (quantitative) analysis based on the nanometer probe is expected to have a significant impact on the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The combination of the unique imaging and analytical capabilities provides a new tool to support users working in various thrust areas closely tied with DOE critical missions, including environmental science, biology, chemistry, energy and materials science. The He+ ion microscope we are seeking should offer the following features:</p>
<p>(1) High-quality imaging of nanostructures and biological samples with a sub-nanometer spatial resolution</p>
<p>(2) Capability of performing RBS with a sub-nanometer He+ ion probe</p>
<p>(3) Small beam energy spread (&plusmn;1 eV) and small beam current variation (&lt; 2%) over the time of data collection</p>
<p>(4) Facility to introduce reactive gases for in-situ chemical reaction studies</p>
<p>(5) Provision to develop ion-beam induced luminescence capability</p>
<p>(6) Availability of 2 or 3 vacuum ports for future capability enhancement, such as surface science related capabilities and addition of a sample processing chamber</p>
<p>In addition, we require ease of operation and windows operated user interface and controls. EMSL being a user facility, the instrument supplier should offer user friendly training, high durability and excellent technical, engineering support to minimize the down time.<br /><br />Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:</p>
<p>1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.</p>
<p>2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development & Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, Clothing and Configuration Management Team on behalf of the Program Manager for Clothing and Individual Equipment have identified a need for a business which can manage the supply chain for various types of flame resistant garments and ensure 100% of the Armys fielding requirements are met.<BR><BR>The Army will be fielding approximately 840,000 Flame Resistant Garments in various configurations and sizes during the next year. Current inventories, fluctuating demand and the criticality of these items are such that the Army cannot rely solely on current requisitions, contracting actions and supply chains to meet near term fielding requirements. Additionally the long lead time in production of FR garments contributes to the by size shortages per fielding cycle. To combat these shortages the Army is looking to work with a single Supply Chain Manager that will monitor inventory, predict shortfalls and partner with various industrial capabilities (mandatory and small business sources as directed) which will have a quick turn capability to address these shortages. This production should be available in our warehouses in less than 10 days. This quick turn capability is required for the following items; Fire Resistant Army Combat Uniforms, ARMY Combat Shirts, Improved Combat Vehicle Crewmans Coveralls, Aviation Aircrew Combat Uniform, and Fuel Handlers Coveralls, with a quantity of approximately 5000 garments of identified uniform type in any given month.       <BR><BR>The government would like to hold a meeting with industry leaders that have experience in the supply chain management, lean manufacturing, quick turn capabilities, and have the potential to meet these productions requirements. This meeting will be held on 15May 2009 at the warehousing facility in Haymarket VA.  This facility currently manages the fielding of these garments. Attendance is limited to two individual per company and a prior approval of the attendees is needed for access to the location.  <BR><BR>Interested firms are requested to submit names and any relevant information on their company by COB 11 May.

<DESC>The US Army Office of the Program Manager Close Combat Systems (OPMCCS),Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources to fabricate, test and deliver the XM7 Spider Network Command Munition (an anti-personnel Munition System). The Government will require the contractor to deliver 11 Spider Systems per month.  The Spider system currently in production meets the Presidents Anti-Personnel Landmine (APL) policy with regards to Non-Self Destruct/Self-Destruct APL. Spider is a stand-alone weapon system consisting of three main hardware components: a Remote Control Station (RCS), a Repeater for extended communications, and a Munition Control Unit (MCU), capable of containing up to six individual Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGLs). Spider will be compatible with the U.S. Army battlefield key management infrastructure and the Navy Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). Spider must meet the COMSEC and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) requirements contained in the Spider Security Policy. Spider is currently using removable media compatible with the Force XXI Battle Command Battalion/Brigade and Below (FBCB2), an indirect interface.  There is urgency in completing the Spider production and fielding as many systems as possible to fill the operational capability void that will exist after 31 December 2010, the date that the US will no longer utilize persistent landmines. Interested contractors must have the necessary equipment and skills to produce Spider systems and meet our program requirements. The XM-7 Spider system is built to a performance specification and the Government does not have a mature Technical Data Package. 
Interested parties that believe they can meet the above requirements shall provide a brief summary of their capabilities in manufacturing, and testing.  Responses should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company-include contact persons name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e-mail address, (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc) as well as provide minimum and maximum monthly production capabilities.
This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding for any activity to support current or future production efforts. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Airstrip Technologies is the only company that provides connection service, and subscription services for Airstrip OB. Nellis AFB has already invested approximately $68,000 into the Airstrip OB project. Procuring subscription services from any other company would require purchasing new hardware and software, negating the money that has already been invested. In summary, to procure subscription services from any company, other than Airstrip Technologies would result in substantial duplication of costs, not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.</p>

<DESC>Description of Supplies or Services: The College of Distance Education (CDE), Naval War College has a requirement to conduct nonresident evening courses in the Norfolk, VA area.  The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses.  Because the site of the course is removed from the Naval War College, it is necessary to contract an individual who resides in the Norfolk, VA area to serve as an instructor and local administrator for the course. The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, knowledge of joint warfare concepts, a familiarity with Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level. The Naval War College intends to award a sole source contract to prepare, conduct and administer two graduate level courses in Nati! onal Security Decision making to be held in the Norfolk, VA area to R. L. Powers. The period of performance will be 07AUG2009-04JUN2010. This will be a firm fixed price contract.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, Tacoma, WA intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) Sole Source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The VA intends to award a contract to Arjo for Maxi Ski Ceiling Mounted Patients Lifts. The Lifts are standardized to the existing Arjo Patient Lift Systems currently in use at both Campuses of the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System. It is the intent of the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System to standardize with a single type of patient lift for Life/Safety of both patients and staff. In emergent patient transfers involving patient lifts, staff must have complete and intimate familiarity with sling functions and lift controls. In addition, switching to a different product would entail retraining Nursing and Biomedical Staff and re-tooling the Biomedical Support Staff for maintenance of a separate system, which would introduce unacceptable inefficiencies and expenses and would not be in the government's best interest. A justification for other than full and open competition is prepared in support of this acquisition. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Applicable NAICS code is 423450. Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by e-mails addressed to craig.magee@va.gov or by phone at 253.583.2169. Responses will be accepted no later than 4:30 PM (EST) on April 27, 2009.

<a href="mailto:terricka.d.leonard@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District (CESAM) intends to award modifications to the following Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering period consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price task orders which are placed against three (3) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide Supplies and Construction Services with Design Capabilities in South America, primarily in Colombia.  All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in May 6, 2009.  As a result, CESAM has developed an acquisition strategy and is conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on acquisitions, under NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation for the follow-on acquisitions was released in Mar 2009 with the projected awards to be made in Summer 2009.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by six (6) months.<BR><BR>The programmatic capacity for each contract is $20 million encompassing a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was established based on an analysis of  the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work, and upon historical program data. The Government reserves the right to unilaterally modify the ordering period of each contract award, within the Governments sound discretion, in order to adjust for changes in performance capabilities.  <BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  W91278-04-D-0033 (Contracting, Consulting, Engineering, LLC), W91278-04-D-0034 (E.E.I.I., LTDA) and W91278-04-D-0036 (Engage Joint Venture).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the Governments requirements.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for these construction services, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above in South America within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The statement shall include pricing information which includes profit rate, overhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates; business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.  Written inquiries may be directed to Ms. Melinda Bramlett via email at Melinda.H.Bramlett@usace.army.mil<BR>

Chemistry of Pyrotechnics and Explosives has been designated by ATF O 3323.1, dated October 2008, as a mandatory explosives training course for ATF Special Agent Certified Explosive Specialists.  The course is also offered to ATF Industry Operations Investigators, Explosives Enforcement Officers and Chemists, as well as State and local certified bomb technicians and fire investigators.  The three day course, developed by Dr. John Conkling, Ph.D., has been refined specifically to provide law and regulatory enforcement specialists with a scientific background in explosives materials, focusing on the basic principles and behavior properties of pyrotechnic and explosives chemistry.  Dr. Conkling is a world-renowned author and lecturer in the field of pyrotechnics and explosives chemistry.  His textbook, Chemistry of Pyrotechnics: Basic Principles and Theory, is the basis for this course.  He offers this course under his Summer Pyrotechnic Seminars program.  On day one, the course provides an overview and basic principles of energetic materials, to include the definitions and terminology for energetic materials; an introduction to energetic materials; fundamentals of pyrotechnics; and an introduction to explosives.  Explosives and propellants are covered on day two, with an in-depth discussion concerning detonation vs. deflagration; explosives systems, explosive articles and devices; civilian vs. military explosives; and propellants and low explosives.  On day three, instruction covers pyrotechnics and fireworks, discussing the classification of explosives and pyrotechnics; oxidizers, fuels and special effects; sensitivity of energetic materials; fireworks devices  construction and manufacture; and disposal and emergency response.  During the last hour of each day, the points made in the classroom lecture are reinforced with a laboratory demonstration.  On day one, a demonstration of components (fuels to oxidizers) is conducted to show the effects of oxidizers (potassium perchlorate, potassium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, and strontium nitrate) and fuels (sulfur, charcoal, sugar, magnalium, and red gum) when exposed to flame.  Fuels and oxidizers are mixed to show how a change in fuels affects pyrotechnic performance.  The role of mixing is examined by comparing an energetic pyrotechnic system with a lower energy system to demonstrate that energetic mixtures require a minimum of blending to produce a highly reactive material, and lower energy compositions require extended mixing to create a reactive composition.  On day two, oxidizer/fuel weight ratios are examined, to display how a change in the ratio by weight of oxidizer to fuel affects performance.  The instructor demonstrates to what extent the burn rate of a pyrotechnic mixture is affected by the particle size and degree of homogeneity of the composition.  On day three, the instructor produces pyrotechnic effects by creating basic pyrotechnic compositions to show color and spark phenomena.  

The training classes must accommodate 50 or more attendees, and a fully equipped laboratory where the daily laboratory demonstrations are conducted.  


Services provided:

The contract must provide for the cost of the training facility, training materials (text book and course binder), instructor fee, laboratory fees, meals and lodging.  The NAICS code is 611699 with a small business size standard not to exceed $7,000,000.

Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.<br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.<br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.<br />8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.<br />h.

Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br />b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.<br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.<br />3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.<br />b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html<br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance.

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will select the best overall offer based on the Past and Present Performance, Technical Capability, and Price. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government. Past Performance is equally as important as the Technical factor. Past Performance and Technical, when combined, are more important than price. The government seeks to award to the offeror who best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's quoted shall be made. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. A rating of unacceptable will render the entire proposal unacceptable. The Government will determine technical acceptability as described by the evaluation factors. In making this decision, the Contracting Officer will integrate the evaluation team's evaluations of the evaluation factors. While the evaluation team and the Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>1. Technical Factor: Trained Contractor Personnel: The standard is met when adequate resumes/certifications for key personnel are provided with sufficient information indicating personnel education, experience as well as any other information relative to performance of this contract. The extent, depth and quality of the key personnel's relevant work experience, as well as the quality and applicability of their education technical experience and professional development as they relate to their proposed position in performance of the contract shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>The following technical evaluation factors will be evaluated and rated according to the chart listed below:</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br />Acceptable Acceptable - meets minimum mandatory requirements.<br />Unacceptable Unacceptable - does not meet minimum mandatory requirements.</p>
<p><br />2. Past Performance Factor:</p>
<p>A) Given the critical need to guard against poor contract performance, the past and present performance evaluation factor will assess the relevance and breadth of the Offeror's experience provided by (1) the references from the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>(B) The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past and present performance. The past evaluation will assess the offeror's record of providing high quality services in a timely manner; conforming to specifications and the standards of good workmanship; adhering to contract schedules. Provide a list of at least two (2), but no more than four (4), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years that demonstrate your ability to perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>3. Price Factor: This factor will evaluated the cost proposal to determine price analysis and price reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced if they are significantly overstated or understated in relation to the actual cost of the work. This may be ground for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. By signing its offer, the offeror certifies that the price stated on the CLIN includes an appropriate apportionment of all costs, direct and indirect, overhead, and profit. Review of the offeror price data will consist of an analysis to determine the following:</p>
<p>(A) Price Analysis. All cost and financial information required by this RFQ and amendment (s) there to have been submitted. One or more of the following techniques may be used to perform price analysis.<br />(1) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.<br />(2) Comparison if prior proposed prices and contract prices with current proposed prices received for the same or similar end items.<br />(3) Comparison of proposed prices with Independent Government Estimates (IGE).<br /><br />(B) Price Reasonableness. Each quotation will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed price to be reasonable. The government will evaluate price reasonableness in relation to commercial or market price lists, IGCE, or any other information used as a basis for comparison.</p>
<p>(C)The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation; will be the most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the requirement. Only those offerors determined to be in compliance with the requirements as stated in this solicitation will be considered for award. If additional information is required to support price reasonableness, each offeror may be requested to provide a hard copy of their price break-down. Non-conformance with this requirement may result in offeror's quote being determined unacceptable.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will select the best overall offer based on the Past and Present Performance, Technical Capability, and Price. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government. Past Performance is equally as important as the Technical factor. Past Performance and Technical, when combined, are more important than price. The government seeks to award to the offeror who best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's quoted shall be made. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. A rating of unacceptable will render the entire proposal unacceptable. The Government will determine technical acceptability as described by the evaluation factors. In making this decision, the Contracting Officer will integrate the evaluation team's evaluations of the evaluation factors. While the evaluation team and the Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>1. Technical Factor: Trained Contractor Personnel: The standard is met when adequate resumes/certifications for key personnel are provided with sufficient information indicating personnel education, experience as well as any other information relative to performance of this contract in accordance with paragraph 1.6.4.1. The extent, depth and quality of the key personnel's relevant work experience, as well as the quality and applicability of their education technical experience and professional development as they relate to their proposed position in performance of the contract shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>The following technical evaluation factors will be evaluated and rated according to the chart listed below:</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br />Acceptable Acceptable - meets minimum mandatory requirements.<br />Unacceptable Unacceptable - does not meet minimum mandatory requirements.</p>
<p><br />2. Past Performance Factor:</p>
<p>A) Given the critical need to guard against poor contract performance, the past and present performance evaluation factor will assess the relevance and breadth of the Offeror's experience provided by (1) the references from the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>(B) The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past and present performance. The past evaluation will assess the offeror's record of providing high quality services in a timely manner; conforming to specifications and the standards of good workmanship; adhering to contract schedules. Provide a list of at least two (2), but no more than four (4), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years that demonstrate your ability to perform the proposed effort of post production services for a live musical production. Sample of work shall be provided in a DVD format.</p>
<p>3. Price Factor: This factor will evaluated the cost proposal to determine price analysis and price reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced if they are significantly overstated or understated in relation to the actual cost of the work. This may be ground for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. By signing its offer, the offeror certifies that the price stated on the CLIN includes an appropriate apportionment of all costs, direct and indirect, overhead, and profit. Review of the offeror price data will consist of an analysis to determine the following:</p>
<p>(A) Price Analysis. All cost and financial information required by this RFQ and amendment (s) there to have been submitted. One or more of the following techniques may be used to perform price analysis.</p>
<p>(1) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.<br />(2) Comparison if prior proposed prices and contract prices with current proposed prices received for the same or similar end items.<br />(3) Comparison of proposed prices with Independent Government Estimates (IGE).<br /><br />(B) Price Reasonableness. Each quotation will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed price to be reasonable. The government will evaluate price reasonableness in relation to commercial or market price lists, IGCE, or any other information used as a basis for comparison.</p>
<p>(C)The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation; will be the most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the requirement. Only those offerors determined to be in compliance with the requirements as stated in this solicitation will be considered for award. If additional information is required to support price reasonableness, each offeror may be requested to provide a hard copy of their price break-down. Non-conformance with this requirement may result in offeror's quote being determined unacceptable.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Factor II - Past Performance

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested.  The solicitation number for this procurement is DTNH22-09-R-00239 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This solicitation incorporated clauses from FAR Subpart 12.4Unique Requirements Regarding Terms and Conditions for Commercial Items.   The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code associated with this procurement is 423110.  This procurement has been set-aside for small business participation.    

BACKGROUND:

NHTSA has been studying the issue of motorcoach occupant safety for many years.  On average, motorcoach crashes causes 14 deaths annually; 34% of all fatalities in motor coaches occur due to vehicles rollover.  Preventing ejections and ensuring occupant compartment integrity in rollovers is one way to improve motorcoach safety.  

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.    As part of its mission to reduce fatalities and injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes, the NHTSA promulgates Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). 

OBJECTIVES:

Determine if motorcoaches sold in the United States meet the ECE R.66 rollover/roof crush requirements.  The research program will also investigate the kinematics and injury measures of instrumented dummies in the motorcoach.  After the rollover test, the motorcoach/motorcoach parts will be used in other NHTSA research efforts such as motorcoach fire safety, glazing, and interior impact.

This research is considered as very high priority by Rulemaking.  The agency is under increased pressure because of NTSB recommendations and recent cases of motorcoach crashes to address the issues related to motorcoach safety.  The goal is to conduct the rollover test by July 2009.

  States Department of Agriculture, is seeking contractor(s) to provide services 
  for the collection of rangeland data on selected sample points for the 
  National Resources Inventory (NRI), Rangeland Field Study in Oregon.     
  The intent of the Agency is to solicit the most efficient and effective manner 
  to complete the requirements set forth in this document.  To achieve this 
  goal, the requirements are subject to negotiations between NRCS and the 
  Offerors.  After which, requirements may be refined and the Offerors 
  requested to submit revised proposals.       

  The result of negotiations will be the award of a performance-based  
  service contract to the Contractor(s) whose proposal most successfully addresses 
  the requirements outlined in this solicitation.  The requirements are 
  defined based on the output of products and services and not the level of 
  effort required to perform the functions. The performance period begins 
  May 18, 2009 and concludes October 15, 2009.  The contract includes
  one option year.

  Background:
  NRCS is mandated (through Rural Development Act of 1972, the Soil and Water 
  Resources Conservation Act of 1977, and other supporting legislation) to 
  assess the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources 
  on the National non-Federal lands. Resources inventory legislative 
  authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are 
  contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.

  Objective/Scope:
  The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified inventory data on 
  two data points in each of about 44 primary sample units (PSU) (a total of about 88 data 
points) located in five (5) counties within the state of Oregon. The subject counties, and the approximate number of points in each, is as follows: Grant (10 points/ 5 PSUs); Harney (28 points/14 PSUs); Malheur (28 points/14 PSUs); Umatilla (10 points/5 PSUs); and Union (12 points/6 PSUs) 

  The general data categories include: soil and landscape information; ecological site 
  information; rangeland health indicators; invasive/noxious plant presence; 
  disturbance indicators; conservation practices and resource concerns; plant 
  composition and patterns; and plant production, cover, density, and height.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>17 April 09- The purpose of this modification is to post some questions from intrested vendors&nbsp;and answers from the customer in addition to the solicitation.</p>
<p>#1 I see "place of performance" Travis AFB. does this mean that the repairs must take place at Travis?</p>
<p>No transportation is for the transport of the truck to and from Travis AFB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1A Because I also see 0003-aa "transportation to and from Travis, to include all permits required" which to me looks like it may be done off site?</p>
<p>No on site repair capability and it is the vendors responsibility to transport the fire truck</p>
<p>#3 If done off site, does transportation days count as 7 day completion dead line?</p>
<p>No, time is expected to be only a couple hours each way.</p>
<p>#4 Can repairs be done on weekend if done onsite? Not available</p>
<p>#5 To bid some items we would need to I.D. the parts.= belts and filters. If the ones on truck cannot be reused they must replace them. If they can be reused then they would reuse them there is no way of identifying this. we would need to provide a complete engine break down and that is the vendors responsibility. We do not know what they will or won't be able to use until it is inspected by the vendor but should be covered in the overall expense they Quote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;#6 Are the bearings that need replacing, standard or oversize? Unknown until engine opened and inspected. and the vendor should know this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#7 Can the oil pan be removed with the engine in place? or does the engine have to come out of the vehicle to repair it?? No the oil pan will not come off while in the truck If they are asking they don't have the necessary equipment to do the overhaul. And are trying to see if they can shorten their process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#8 I'm sure only the manufacturer can answer some of these questions if we could have the v.i.n number and model of the vehicle we could contact oshkosh for some answers.</p>
<p>Engine: Oshkosh T-3000 AAF truck<br />S/N# 10TDK8Z1415069443<br />Detroit Diesel<br />Model: 8V92TADDEC<br />S/N# DD08VF180316<br />Date Built: Aug 2000<br />585 Horse Power, 12.1 Liter</p>
<p>#9 Also I noticed there are not injectors, nor turbocharger listed as part of the overhaul, would you like these quoted also? Injectors, injector pump, transfer pump, turbo, water pump and related parts, filters etc. are part of overhaul see question 5</p>

<DESC>This amendment to the solicitation provides answers to questions:

Questions:
1.  Are you only interested in our Fee Proposal based on the information in the synopsis?

Answer:   INL is interested in a fee proposal based on the requirements contained in the  solicitation. Interested offerors can certainly provide additional information the company may feel will  support its technical proposal.

2.  Do I need to respond to questions via online as I did not notice any tool to do so? 

Answer:   The solicitation requires the contractor to provide informational material electronically.   The contractor can propose an on-line tool to respond to questions from participants or potential participants.

3.  For our Fee Proposal, we need to assume a level of annual cash flow.
It's unlikely that all 624 participants will contribute $22,000.  Should I still assume that figure of $500,000 bi-weekly for 624 participants or something else?

Answer:   Potentially not all participants will contribute the maximum amount.   Offerors may  base their fees quotations on various number groupings. For example, what would be the fee at different levels of participations.

<DESC>Q:  Can you tell me what version of call manager you are running, as this will determine what phone and what license you need. If you are running 4.0 or older, there is only one part number which includes the phone and license.  If you are running higher than 4.0, there are two part numbers.<BR><BR>A:  We don't know who will be our call manager yet. We have to work with DISA on<BR>this after we have established our network. So I will purchase the phones<BR>without a license.  The only difference is whether I purchase the license<BR>with the phone or separate. Since I believe my supporting call manager will<BR>be Version 4 or older, I will purchase without the license.<BR><BR>Q:  We can quote the Cisco IP phones new, but we also have these in stock as refurbished.  Would you like to check with the user if they would like to look at refurbished?  They come with a 90 day no question asked return policy and have been fully reconditioned and tested.<BR><BR>A:  New vs Refurbished:  I will accept refurbished as long as they are like<BR>new (little or no sign of wear) and carry the same warranty as the new<BR>ones.<BR>

<DESC><p>This amendment/modification will incorporate various changes as listed below. Revised documents are now attached.</p>
<p>Media Services RFQ Amendments (in brief)</p>
<p>Below is a list of the significant substantive amendments the FCC has made to RFQ RFQ09000063 in response to questions asked by industry vendors. Please review this list carefully in addition to the responses to the questions as well as - and more importantly - the amended RFQ itself.</p>
<p>1. Date change<br />a. The new closing date for submissions is Thursday, April 23, 2009 at noon.<br />2. Task Order Changes<br />a. The Task Orders have been renumbered.<br />b. Two Task Orders will be awarded at the outset of the contract, Task Orders 1 and 2. More will certainly follow in short order after initial contact.<br />c. In Task Order 1, the need for media training has been eliminated and crisis communications has been added. Pricing for press events may be excluded.<br />d. Task Order 3 has been broken up into seven (7) separate Task Orders (now #s 4-10), and the sub-task of "Broadcast-quality videos" has been eliminated (and subsumed into the other video Task Orders).<br />i. One or more of the Task Orders concerning SMTs may be requested multiple times.<br />e. Task Order 4 has been broken up in to separate Task Orders (now #s 11 and 12).<br />f. A new Task Order (#3), "Translation Services" has been added. This Task Order separates out from all the other Task Orders the need for translation into various languages. Bidding on all other Task Orders should assume - for pricing purposes only - that the pieces are created in English only. Pricing for this task order is on a labor-hour basis and assumes 50 hours of Spanish and ASL translation, and 25 hours each of translation for traditional Chinese and Mandarin. <br />g. Task Orders 5 and 9 - Toolkits - have been combined (now #13).<br />h. Task Order 15 (formerly #7) has eliminated the requirement for "aerial photography."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. New pricing structures<br />a. Please be certain to review the kind of pricing sought by each Task Order as indicated in Section B. Some of the Task Orders have been changed to time-and-materials.<br />b. Where materials are needed to develop the applicable bid, please indicate what those anticipated materials are and their cost.<br />4. New price ceiling - incorporating anticipate ad buys<br />a. The maximum for this IDIQ contract is now $3.5 million. This figure incorporates the money that will be allocated for ad buys. Thus, the FCC will reimburse the Contractor for ad placements (in addition to the agency fee on top of the ad buy). However, please be aware that beyond the $500K noted for pricing purposes in Section B Task Order 1, no other figures for ad buys need to be incorporated into an offeror's bidding price. The final ad budget will be determined after the award date.<br />5. Amendments to "DTV RFQ Submission Requirements" document<br />a. The FCC has eliminated the following paragraph:</p>
<p>A separate contract line item number (CLIN) shall be submitted for: production and placement of posters, art, and other marketing materials in various transit systems (e.g., metropolitan train stations, municipal and commuter bus terminals, etc.). This pricing shall be an optional CLIN. The Government reserves the right to split the award for the separately priced "transit" requirement.<br />b. The FCC has also amended the document to include time-and-materials pricing, where appropriate.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: DIGITAL TELEVISION (DTV) TRANSITION CONSUMER EDUCATION AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN SUPPORT SERVICES PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.207(c). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 541820 and Size Standard of $7 Million apply to this solicitation. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television. Approximately one-third of the Nation&rsquo;s 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition. The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009. In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCC&rsquo;s and other entities&rsquo; Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups). This request for quotation (RFQ) seeks proposals from offerors with the ability to provide advertising and public relations expertise, a variety of media services, publications, and targeted distribution services that will supplement and expand our consumer education and awareness campaign relating to the digital television transition. This is a full and open competition to enter into a contract for the successful implementation of a series of defined tasks that are outlined in detail below. The contractor will be responsible to provide solutions to meet all of the objectives of this solicitation. However, not all of the tasks outlined below may be utilized by the FCC in the conduct of its outreach campaign. In essence, the FCC requires a vendor with the ability and wherewithal to provide a media &ldquo;tool kit,&rdquo; which would permit the FCC to pick and choose the deliverables based on the overall outreach plan and the consumer education needs identified. Thus, for each of the tasks outlined, we require that a price be assigned to each specific item outlined in this Statement of Objectives (&ldquo;SOO&rdquo;). Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 13, 2009. Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive. The government contemplates awarding an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract pursuant to FAR Part 16.5. The FCC intends to issue eight (8) Task Orders resulting from this solicitation, although only Task Order 1 (labor-hour) and part of Task 2 (firm-fixed-price) will be issued at the outset. Of the remaining Task Orders, numbers 4 and 8 as well as parts of numbers 2 and 3 may be issued on a firm-fixed-price basis, while numbers 5-7 as well as the remaining parts of numbers 2 and 3 may be issued on a labor-hour basis.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: DIGITAL TELEVISION (DTV) TRANSITION FOR EXPERT, COMPLEX IN-HOME DIGITAL TRANSITION SERVICES Region 3: Southwest (AR, LA, NM, OK, PR, TX) PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 238210 and Size Standard of $14 Million apply to this solicitation. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television. Approximately one-third of the Nation&rsquo;s 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition. The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009. In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCC&rsquo;s and other entities&rsquo; Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups). This RFQ seeks quotations for expert in-home digital transition services. Such services include, but are not limited to, the following elements &ndash; connecting up to two of a household&rsquo;s existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TV(s); making significant adjustments to and movement of existing antennas; scanning and rescanning converter boxes to locate the maximum number of digital broadcast channels available; integrating an existing VCR into the installation; and providing guidance to the consumer on the operation of his or her converter box(es), including the use of closed captioning features. Such services may include integrating two existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes and an existing VCR into the installation so that the consumer can watch one broadcast program while recording another. Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others. Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities. Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARD&mdash;CASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Government&rsquo;s needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 10, 2009. Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive. NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW).

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: DIGITAL TELEVISION (DTV) TRANSITION FOR EXPERT, COMPLEX IN-HOME DIGITAL TRANSITION SERVICES Region 5: East Central (IN, KY, MI, OH, WV) PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 238210 and Size Standard of $14 Million apply to this solicitation. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television. Approximately one-third of the Nation&rsquo;s 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition. The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009. In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCC&rsquo;s and other entities&rsquo; Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups). This RFQ seeks quotations for expert in-home digital transition services. Such services include, but are not limited to, the following elements &ndash; connecting up to two of a household&rsquo;s existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TV(s); making significant adjustments to and movement of existing antennas; scanning and rescanning converter boxes to locate the maximum number of digital broadcast channels available; integrating an existing VCR into the installation; and providing guidance to the consumer on the operation of his or her converter box(es), including the use of closed captioning features. Such services may include integrating two existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes and an existing VCR into the installation so that the consumer can watch one broadcast program while recording another. Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others. Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities. Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARD&mdash;CASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Government&rsquo;s needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 10, 2009. Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov. Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive. NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW). See attached file containing SOW, proposal/quote instructions and evaluation criteria.</p>

<p>The maximum number of installations shall not exceed 500 per week however the Government reserves the right, after award, to modify quantities based on increased demands in the successful offerors geographical area.</p>
<p>Under Enclosure 3, Price evaluation factor (Factor 2), add the following: Unit prices will be evaluated for reasonableness, which may include comparison of an offeror's proposed price to prices submitted by any other offerors (including offerors under other tiers of the cascading set-aside). Contract awards will not be made to offerors that propose unit prices that the FCC determines to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>In addition, Q&amp;As are hereby enclosed.<br /><br />The closing date and time for quotations is hereby extended to 4/21/09, Noon, Eastern.</p>

<p>Q: Is it possible to get double trailers into and dump at the dump site?</p>
<p>A: Yes, double trailers will fit in the dump site.</p>
<p>Q: Is it possible to get the dumping times lengthened?</p>
<p>A: Under ordinary circumstances, no. The times stated in the solicitation are based on gate limitations (e.g. overhead clearance, concrete barriers, serpentines, normal hours of operation) and to provide sufficient time to enter, unload, and exit through an appropriate gate. Under extraordinary circumstances, yes. For example, if your vehicle is delayed on base until after gate closure, the government will do what is necessary to allow your vehicle to exit the base through an appropriate gate.</p>

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008.

<DESC>Solicitation Amendment number 001Solicitation number VA-244-09-RP-0156 Potential Contractors Questions and Answers:1.  When I list the unit price for each BLS or ALS run on section  B.2  do I make an assumption of mileage for us to price a total transport cost or is section D to determine each mile paid.  I see where we are to invoice each mile but an unsure how to account for it in our bid.Please explain how or where we include a way to recover a cost per mile on this bid.   Answer:  B.2. is Base Price for local through long distance transportation based on definitions found on page 7, Location of Work.The bulk of the trips for VAMC Clarksburg are considered local. An avaerage for the majority of the local area trips has been estimated at 30 miles.Section D is an economic price adjustment clause to be used only during option year price adjustment for fuel.2.  I am doing a bid for VA 244-09 and have a question on a Bid Guarantee.  Page 5 d. requires a bid guarantee to be included.  Is this the answers provided to this paper copy of the bid or special language that must be included with this bid.  I have not run into a request for a Bib Guarantee before. Answer:Reference / Requirement for Bid Guarantee was incorporated by mistake.  There is NO bid guarantee requirement for this solicitation.  Please delete page 5 item d.

GFSC currently uses the IT Change Control Broad (ITCCB) BAseline approval list for server specifications.  http://enm.irm.state.gov/IT_CCB/Baselines/Hardware/hwbaseline_servers.html  We currently have a server farm with all Hewlett Packard (HP) servers similar to the server erquested above and they all fit into our current rack space/configuration.  Substitutions may cause problems with space and compatibility. It would be safer to stay in the Hewlett Packard family of servers from a prior generation than to go with a brand/server that has never been on the approved list. Since GFSC already has a farm of HP servers, when we order new servers, we also order parts/drives that are interchangeable, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs and a single vendor point of contact for onsite maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required. . . .<BR><BR>

This hardware and software provides a high availability storage environment for the core production financial applications, office productivity applications, and electronic messaging services for the GFSC Continuity of Operations Plan facility located in the D.C. metro area.  The mission critical nature of this hardwar and software requires periodic incremental upgrades of hardware and software to preserve the performance characteristics of these applications under increased user and data volumes.  Components of the hardware and all of the software for this platform are the intellectual property of NetApps, and are therefore not available from another commercial vendor.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's Regional Financial Management System.<BR><BR>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR OCEANIC DATA LINK TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM/SERVICE.
This announcement is amended to update:1. Vendors must provide two (2) copies of the capabilities/knowledge summary not to exceed eight (8) pages.2. Business Declaration Form.
This is a market survey for Oceanic Data Link (ODL) Telecommunications System/Service.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
In order to compete for this effort all interested parties must have an existing system that is fully capable of meeting the FAA's immediate requirements.
The ODL Telecommunications System/Service consists of routing and delivery of messages used in the provision of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services, which originate from and are addressed to FAA ATC automation systems.
This service must be provided to the New York, Oakland and Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), the William J Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC).  The service supports Advanced Technologies and Oceanic Procedures (ATOP), Flight Data Processor (FDP2000) system, and Future Air Navigation System (FANS 1/A) aircraft.
The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing: Message Routing and Delivery service and Network Access for ODL Telecommunications System/Service.  Vendors must demonstrate that they have the following capabilities/knowledge:	Provide Hardware and Software equipment/infrastructure including satellite network service for an ODL Telecommunications service/system.	Engineering and Maintenance services for ODL equipment.	Provide technical support for Interface Testing of the ATOP and FDP2000 systems.	Knowledge of existing ODL FAA system.
The estimated value for this requirement is $3,000,000 to $5,000,000.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing ODL Telecommunications System/Service.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541990, with a size standard of $7.0 million.   
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All pages for the submissions must conform to the following format: minimum 10 point font, 1 inch margins, single sided, no foldouts, and be on 8.5 X 11 size paper.
All responses to this market survey must be received by April 22, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  Responses may be hand delivered or sent via e-mail to:

<DESC>QUESTION:  Page 22 of the solicitation states that "the VA Medical Centers do not have dictation equipment." And on page 86, the solicitation states that Offeror "equipment and software shall be compatible with Dictaphone Enterprise Express Dictation System."
If the VAMCs do not have dictation equipment, there should not be a need for Offeror equipment to be compatible with Dictaphone Enterprise Express Dictation System (DEEDS). Will the government consider removing the requirement from the solicitation for Offeror equipment to be compatible with DEEDS?
ANSWER:  This was an oversight.  There will not be any VA Equipment provided, therefore there is not be an equipment compatibility requirement, BUT, the successful offeror must be able to be compatible with VA's internal computer systems (VISTA, CPRS)

The ships have differing mission requirements and a broad range of propulsion and shipboard control architectures. MSC plans to upgrade and replace these machinery control, alarm and monitoring systems during shipyard availabilities.  MSC expects to separately solicit and award contracts for ship class or individual design, fabrication and installation of these systems.  The purpose of this contract is provide project management and engineering services to assist MSCs project design team with implementing consistency in practices across the MSC fleet as it relates to the implementation of shipwide automation, control and monitoring systems for individual and multiple ship classes and platforms. MSC requires technical project management, engineering services and expertise to: 1.Assist in the development of fleet-wide automation system performance requirements; 2.Evaluate automation, controls and monitoring system specifications ; 3. Perform comparison analysis of multiple ship classes; 4.Review alternate automation, control, monitoring, alarm and equipment health data management implementation strategies;  5.Evaluate system designs and architecture; 6.Recommend and review documentation requirements for hardware, software, operation, installation, test and acceptance;  7.Ensure consistency in design, architecture and documentation requirements;  8.Provide long term management support of the individual projects.

Description:This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the NAVFACEngineering Service Center (ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement isopen until 15 May 2009. NAVFAC ESC is interested in a software based model thatcan be used to analyze the integration of photovoltaic systems, wind energysystems, conventional diesel generation, and energy storage.  The model shouldaddress design issues related to the following: 
.	Renewable energy resources have intermittent availability (e.g., windspeed varies, isolation varies, etc.).  .	Space limitations often restrict energy storage strategies and capacityof RE generation that can be installed.  .	There may be multiple renewable energy systems installed where little orno configuration was made to accommodate future integration and control.  .	Maintaining micro-grid/building-level circuit stability during outage
The purpose of the model includes the following: .	to provide analysis needed to optimize use of photovoltaic (PV) powerand wind power, diesel generation and maintaining stability during outage.	provide analysis of energy storage requirements.	provide an analysis needed to integrate multiple planned/unplanned PVand wind power 
This announcement is for abstracts only and shall be no more than five (5) pagesof technical material.  The abstracts shall outline the topics of interest.  Theabstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant tothis announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit.  Theaward will be for up to $400,000.   Multiple awards may be made under thisannouncement.  Topics of interest described below are provided as guides toareas that must be included in the abstract for the model.  Also, it is expectedthat abstracts will not limit the approach to only these specified in the topiclist.  Individual topics of interest are as follows:
1)	The model will include solar and wind generation, energy storage, andcontrols that isolate the building in event of a power failure, and integraterenewable power with that from diesel back-up emergency generators.  2)	The model will be enhanced by incorporating data from manufacturerperformance data. 3)	The model will provide an analysis of interoperability, performancecharacteristics and financial performance of various integrated renewablesystems and back-up diesel generation.  Measure system response time, firstcost, output, reliability, maintenance and percent load provided.  Test andrecommend strategies to power isolated loads directly from renewable systems,isolate buildings from the grid or control renewable and emergency generatorsvia control systems (e.g., Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems).4)	The model will predict interoperability of distributed, multiple,installation level renewables systems. The results will be used to recommendtechnical guidance for implementation multiple renewable systems through-out aNavy base for maximum benefit.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Roseburg Healthcare System, has awarded a sole source purchase order to  provide patient transportation services and the full range of paramedic and ambulance services in the local community for beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) in VA ROSEBURG HEALTHCARE SYSTEM to Douglas County Fire District 2.  The awarded purchase order is  for a firm fixed price  and covers a three month period from April 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009.  It is the Government's belief that only Douglas County Fire District 2 possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement. Please refer to the Sole Source Justification. This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is notice of a sole source contract award.
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
VA653-C94149
PARAMEDIC AND AMBULANCE SERVICES
SOLE SOURCE AWARD

1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition."?	Roseburg VA Healthcare System 913 NW Garden Valley Blvd, Roseburg, OR  974702.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.?	Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for Ambulance Services.  Purchase order awarded to Douglas County Fire District 2 for the period of 4/1/09 to 6/30/09.3.  A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).?	Paramedic and Ambulance Services 4/1/09 to 6/30/09, estimated value $141,000.
4.  An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.?	FAR  6.302-1(b)(1)(i) Services are available from only one source5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.?	Douglas County Fire District 2 is on the only licensed provider in Roseburg and the only one in Douglas County with an extensive fleet of ground transport vehicles.  The other providers in the county have an insufficient number of vehicles to fill the requirements of the Roseburg VA .  6.  A description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.?	Yellow page listings were reviewed by the Contracting Officer.  ?	State of Oregon Department of Licenses, Permits and Registrations was contacted by the Contracting Officer for a listing of licensed providers.?	A notification of intent to make a sole source award was publicized in FedBizOpps.
7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.?	The Contracting Officer determined that the price proposed of $141,000.00 was fair and reasonable.8.  A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.?	Market research included checking the yellow pages and contacting the State of Oregon to determine if there were other licensed contractors in the Roseburg area.  As stated in #5, Douglas County Fire District 2 is on the only licensed provider in Roseburg and the only one in Douglas County with an extensive fleet of ground transport vehicles.  The other providers in the county have an insufficient number of vehicles to fill the requirements of the Roseburg VA.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:	i.  Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.	?   The contracting activity seeks to maximize competition whenever possible.  However, paramedic and ambulance service requirements are very specific and regulated and there is only one responsible source available to meet the Government's needs.  Seeking further competition under these circumstances would serve no useful purpose.	ii.  When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-(1)(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.	?  N/A10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.?  None to date11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.?  This acquisition is truly a sole source requirement and there were no barriers to competition to remove.
