<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a notice of intent (NOI2028).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-03.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541890 and the Small Business Size Standard is 5M.  SCHEDULE:  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intend to procure on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisition procedures with the Washington Post for recruitment of volunteers for HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials.  The Immunology Lab of the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) was established with a research focus of developing vaccines for human diseases.  An integral step in this development is testing for safety and efficacy in human clinical trials.  In order to proceed with this testing, the VRC must recruit eligible volunteers to participate in the clinical trials.  The VRC has a goal to recruit 200 healthy adults, ages 18-60, per year.  In order to meet this goal, the VRC requires targeted advertising to the largest possible audience with the desired demographics.  The target audience for the advertisements must be in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area.  The Washington Post reaches over 1.5 million readers daily, and 2.1 million readers on Sunday.  In comparison to other newspapers, the Washington Times? circulation reaches 107,000 in the Washington, D.C. metro area, and the Gazette with a total circulation of 549,000.  No other newspaper in the top metropolitan area reaches its market as broadly as the Post reaches Washington.  Specific requirements are to display twenty advertisements in the Washington Post to ensure that a broad visibility of the VRC?s needs are met.  The Washington Post will be required to perform the following:  1) provide multiple advertisements in different sections of the paper, such as the Tuesday Health section or the Metro Times section, and other sections that would get the most calls of eligible volunteers, 2) display twenty advertisements as needed within a 12-month period, 3) the display ad dimensions are to be 15cm x 26cm, 4) length of page, ? a page, 5) retain developed advertisements to publish on an as-needed basis; and 6) inform the VRC of successful publication, approximate distribution, and any potential problems/errors.  Upon completion, the VRC expects increased exposure and interest in volunteering for current clinical trials and increased recruitment for the trials from the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area.  This will be a firm-fixed price contract.  FOB terms are destination.  The anticipated period of performance will be twelve (12) months from the date of award.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  Copies of the aforementioned clauses are available upon request.  Offers must be submitted no later than 4:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time (EST), 20 February 2002.

<SOLNBR>2270
<RESPDATE>022802
<ARCHDATE>03302002
<CONTACT>Kevin Hart, 781-238-7660
<DESC>The national Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) program represents an integrated solution aimed at addressing FAA-wide lifecycle asset management requirements.  The ASCM system will provide an efficient, effective, and integrated national system to provide asset management functions, thereby providing seamless support to headquarters, regional, and remote field users.  ASCM provides this support over several functional areas: <P> „h Physical Asset Accountability (property management) „h Configuration Management „h Asset History „h Inventory Management „h Acquisition Support „h Workflow Management „h Document Management & Forms „h External system interfaces <P> The technical approach envisioned for national ASCM embraces multi-vendor interoperability, open standards, and scalable designs that integrate client/server and web-based solutions through distributed object technology.  The FAA will achieve this vision using a distributed network-centric enterprise-wide architecture.  Architectures that fulfill these objectives are embodied in commercial off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (COTS/NDI) Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) applications available from several vendors.  <P> The FAA is planning to issue a solicitation to acquire a COTS EAM solution and systems integration support.  The successful offeror will provide the COTS solution and integration skills required for the full lifecycle support of the national ASCM program. <P> An Initial Requirements Document (iRD) was published in October 1999 (see attachment).  This document is currently being expanded and will be used as part of the Request for Offer (RFO).  In a separate but related effort defined within the iRD, the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) is currently developing increased capabilities, referred to as the Logistics Center Support System (LCSS).  Aimed at performing as a stand-alone solution, the LCSS requirements identified in the iRD will not be part of the national ASCM solution set, other than as an interface. <P> In February 2000, the FAA conducted an Industry Day to understand the current state of EAM products and to gain insight into the applicability of these products to the FAA¡¦s asset supply chain management requirements, as defined in the national ASCM iRD.   <P> In conjunction with the Industry Day, the FAA issued a Market Survey questionnaire to vendors expressing an interest in the national ASCM program.  The information gathered as part of the responses to that questionnaire enabled the FAA to validate and verify the COTS / NDI alternative selected for the program¡¦s implementation strategy.   <P> The FAA plans to release a Screening Information Request (SIR) to industry in late February 2002, seeking full and open competition, in which to develop an offerors list.  This SIR will include specific evaluation criteria to determine the experience, skills, and capabilities of prospective offerors.  The SIR will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities Website. <P> Following the SIR, the FAA plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) in early April 2002, to those offerors who have successfully satisfied the above mentioned criteria.  This RFO will include contract terms and conditions, Statement of Work (SOW), and evaluation criteria specific to the requirement.  Subsequently, qualified offerors will be required to perform Operational Capabilities Demonstrations (OCD) using scenarios developed by the FAA. <P> The FAA anticipates a July 2002 award of a national ASCM contract for the development of a program that ties together the management and control of all assets within the FAA under one single system.  The performance period shall consist of a base year plus four separately priced option years. <P> This announcement is for information only and is not a request for proposals. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this public announcement, or reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to the SIR/RFO. <P>  <P> Attachments:  Initial Requirements Document Asset Supply Chain Management (ASCM) < http://www.faa.gov/ats/af/afz.htmafz500 > <P>

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to negotiate a Sole Source purchase order with Giesecke and Devrient America, INC. under the authority of FAR 6.302 and FAR 13.106-1. Award will be made on a sole source basis to relocate the BPS3000 System from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor. Sole sourcing will provide uniformity of the aforementioned equipment and to allow repair personnel the ability to troubleshoot the BPS3000 for which current personnel have already received training. GDAI is the manufacturer of the BPS3000. This machine is used by the Federal Reserve Bank System to examine all of the U.S. currency. Since the machine is a proprietary of the Federal Reserve Bank System, work on the machine is limited to GDAI engineering personnel. Specialized knowledge known only to GDAI is required to install and calibrate the equipment. This is only a notice of intent, not a notice to request. The resulting purchase order will not exceed the simplified purchase threshold. The procedures set forth in FAR 13.106-3 shall be used. Please submit all inquiries or responses via fax at (202) 874-2200 or e-mail at (kenrick.sawh@bep.treas.gov) by 3:00 pm on February 14, 2002.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. EPA, Office of Research and Development intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with  Dr. Paul D. Sampson of the Center for Statistical Consulting to use kriging to develop ambient air concentration estimates for ozone (03), for 1986-1994 for the 56,721 Census block groups in 83 specific counties in the U.S.  After contract award and prior to starting any work, the contractor shall meet with the EPA Project Officer (PO) to review how the kriging shall be conducted.  The PO will provide the contractor with air monitoring data for the years  1986-1994 inclusive of:  1) location (as latitude/longitude) and identification number for each 03 monitor in the US, for each year; 2) raw hourly 03 monitoring data for each monitor, for each year; 3) the daily 1-hr maximum 03 value and the maximum 8-hr 03 average for each monitor for year.  The  PO will also provide the contractor with a list of the 83 counties.  The final product will include a statistical summary of the spatial and temporal correlation structure of the O3 measurement and full written documentation of how the kriging was conducted.  This notice is not a request for  quotations.  EPA's research indicates Dr. Paul D.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>This is a Request for Interest to determine the availability of technologies that can effectively purge residual JP-8 fuel and associated vapors from the internal surfaces of fuel tankers.  The preferred technologies will utilize water only as the purging/cleaning mechanism.  Chemical/reagent addition is not desirable at this time.  It is anticipated that systems shall  utilize a pressurized stream of heated water applied to the surface(s) via pressurized spray nozzle providing 360 degree coverage of all surfaces.  

Wash water must be recoverable and containerized (i.e. storage basin).  Measurements of the waste water shall be made (by others) to determine overall quantities of the following, amounts of fuel present in waste water, particulate quantity, and any additional analysis determined to be necessary at the time of testing.

The intent is to investigate the applicability of the proposed systems as a process-waste control device and a cost savings tool.  The overall goal of implementing the proposed equipment is to reduce waste, time and labor associated with current tank purging procedures.  Responses to this notice will be used to identify candidates for future testing of proposed tanker purge systems.  Prospective vendors should respond by February 12, 2002.  Responses to this announcement should include the cost to perform a 3-day demonstration at Fort Bragg Army Post and a complete description of the proposed purging system(s) including:  process description, equipment specifications, nozzle arrangement, and all other pertinent information required to accurately describe the process and methods employed to clean the proposed surface(s).

Interested parties can obtain the complete specifications from Darcy Byrne-Kelly, Project Manager at MSE-Technology Applications, Inc., 406/494-7419. Email: dbyrne@mse-ta.com

<DESC>s (NIST) Chemical Sciences and Technology Laboratory's (CSTL) Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD).  The contract will consist of a base period of one year and two one-year options to extend the term of the contract.  This is a follow-on effort for a contract previously awarded to Dr. Toropov.  This effort was competed in the past, but offers from other sources were 300% to 400% the cost that was proposed by Dr. Toropov.  Also, at this point, there is so much code written that bringing in a new contractor would make it essentially impossible to deal with the time lines for delivery both for internal NIST use and for DOD externally funded work.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received on or before January 5, 2001 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT TO APPLIED RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 4300 SAN MATEO BLVD. NE, ALBUQUERQUE, NM.  The Contracting Office, AAC/WMO, Eglin AFB FL, intends to issue a sole source procurement to Applied Research Associates (ARA), Inc. for a system performance based contract which will: (1) upgrade to the current configuration, 18 All-Purpose Remote Transport System (ARTS) platforms and varying attachments thereto procured prior to the product baseline that was established in the current contract, F08636-00-C-0027, being executed by ARA?s New England Division in South Royalton VT; (2) secure expanded life-cycle support through an in-depth, contractor support program; (3) produce the FY02-FY05 ARTS platforms and attachments; and (4) implement a series of preplanned product improvement program (P3I) projects mandated by the ARTS Operational Requirements Document or generated by additional mission needs.  The proposed contract will contain provisions placing total system performance and support responsibilities (TSPSR) on the contractor to insure that the contractor is fully responsible for the integration of all systems, subsystems, and components whether Government-furnished property (GFP) or commercially acquired, and for any and all required inspection and acceptance test procedures necessary to meet the system performance specification.  The contractor shall also be responsible for insuring that the integration of the aforementioned will not degrade performance of that item or the ARTS.  Two essential elements of TSPSR will be the transfer of configuration control for the ARTS design and performance from the Government to the contractor.  When retrofitting of the pre-baselined units is complete, all ARTS platforms and attachments, including those acquired under contract F08636-00-C-0027, will be covered by TSPSR.  The basic requirements of the proposed contract are as follows.  Check hyperlinks for additional information.  (A) Pre-baselined Product Upgrade - The 18 pre-baselined systems have varying configurations and attachments as a result of three separate buys.  The contractor must independently determine the configuration differences among these systems as no Government data relative to their component makeup is available.  The only such data is proprietary to ARA.  Each configuration (including the current contracted buy) uses the All-Seasons Vehicle, Inc. Posi-Track crawler, Model MD-70, as the platform upon which the robotized system is based.  The current ARTS configuration differs significantly from the original 18 through incorporation of updated software, electronics and hardware, making it more versatile, reliable and supportable than its predecessors.  These pre-baselined units are to be retrofitted to the configuration that exists in the current product drawings and associated lists with no GFP.  Due to operational mission demands, the pre-baselined ARTS must be retrofitted at each U.S. and overseas field location within seven months of contract award.  (B) Contractor Support - The expanded life-cycle support will include training, electronic technical assistance, on-line parts ordering system, and in-house or on-site robotic assemblies repair support.  Repair of the robotic assemblies are to be accomplished in-house within 72 hours of receipt.  Total system contractor support is expected to be in force for up to ten years and will apply to all ARTS units, including those retrofitted and procured on the existing and proposed procurement.  (C) FY02-FY05 ARTS Platforms and Attachments - The FY02-FY05 production ARTS platforms and attachments are to be produced based on a Government provided system performance specification with the Government no longer furnishing the Posi-Track crawler, Model MD-70, as GFP.  The ARTS platforms and attachments may be purchased in varying quantities during each fiscal year up to a contract maximum quantity of 26 each.  (D) ARTS Preplanned Product Improvements - The contractor will be responsible to implement an ARTS Preplanned Product Improvements (P3I) program to design, integrate, produce, and maintain projects as identified by the Government.  These projects are envisioned as new tools and attachments and may include new generation, standardized software and communication architectures.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirements as delineated in subparagraphs A through D above.  This NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within the 45-day closing period of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any inquiries should be faxed to (850) 882-9381, ATTN:  Mr. Dennis Fields or e-mail dennis.fields@eglin.af.mil.  Please include POC, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address on any inquires.  See Note 22.

He possesses a breadth of experience and recognition in the development of expert systems for the construction, concrete, and coatings industries to accomplish the scope of work.   Additionally, he is author of numerous publications in these fields.  The NAIC is 541710. The size standard is 500 employees. A firm fixed-price purchase order is anticipated.  The period of performance shall be one year from the date of award. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, however, this notice of intent is not a request for competition.  The Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Any written responses to this synopsis must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A Request for Quotation is not available.

<DESC>s (NIST) Chemical Sciences and Technology Laboratory's (CSTL) Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD).  This is a follow-on effort for a contract previously awarded to Dr. Mirokhin.  This effort was competed in the past, but offers from other sources were 300% to 400% the cost that was proposed by Dr. Mirohkin.  Also, at this point, there is so much code written that bringing in a new contractor would make it essentially impossible to deal with the time lines for delivery both for internal NIST use and for DOD externally funded work.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received on or before January 5, 2001 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Fallon Tom, Purchasing Specialist, Phone (703) 280-7934, Fax (703) 280-8412, Email tfallon@email.usps.gov
<DESC>The Need

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is seeking innovative solutions to contain chemical/biological agents in mail collection boxes and in retail lobby drop slots in post offices and other facilities.  The mail collection process includes emptying the collection box, placing an empty container back in the box, and transporting the mail to a centralized point for either transportation consolidation or processing.  Our objective is to ensure the safety of our employees during the mail collection process and protect the public while they are placing mail into a box that may have hazardous substances inside.  The ideal solution would be one that maximizes risk reduction and minimizes cost and impact on the collections process.

Listed below are some approaches that have been discussed and identified:
1. A containment system modification to existing collection boxes and mail slots, 
2. Disposable bags with easy replacement (e.g., rolls of bags with perforations for easy tear-off), with minor modifications if necessary to delivery vehicles to store and access replacement bags.
3. Use of bio-hazard ?test strips? incorporated into the collection boxes, bags or tubs to alert employees to the contamination.
4. Use of substances to provide sanitization or decontamination of mail in containers.
5. Minor modifications to collection boxes or drop slots that limit the dimensions of mail that can be deposited.
6. A method to prevent or handle overflow of any containment system inside of the collection box.

The Process

Step 1:  We are seeking summary-level prototype designs to be submitted by interested suppliers.  These designs will be used as a technical basis for pre-qualification of suppliers.  
Step 2:  The pre-qualified suppliers will receive a request for proposal and, if appropriate, awarded a contract for the design, prototyping, and laboratory testing of the collection box and containers.  Technical Data Packages (TDPs) for the various collection box types will be provided at this point.  Samples of each equipment model will also be provided to suppliers for the prototype phase.  A technical and price competition will be the basis for selection of a final supplier or suppliers for production units.  More than one design may be implemented.
Step 3:  A supplier(s) for production units will be awarded contracts.  

Constraints

&#61623; Innovative but low-cost solutions.  The current cost to manufacture a collections box is about $320.  They require relatively little in maintenance and have been engineered for security.  

&#61623; Intellectual Property Ownership.  The Postal Service must obtain title to and/or unlimited rights (at least as broad as that term is used in the USPS Purchasing Manual) in all intellectual property rights in the technical data package and all systems or equipment described therein.  The supplier must deliver under the final design contract a production quality technical data package, and the source code for software used by the system or equipment described therein.

&#61623; Process Efficiency.  We prefer solutions that add very little time to the collections process.  The collections process occurs throughout the day, but is most intense between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.  Carriers engaged in collections have limited time to empty a box, set up the box with an empty container, get the mail into their vehicles and move on.

&#61623; Esthetics.  The current appearance of the collection box must stay generally the same (curvature on top, logo on side, blue color).  This is a corporate identity issue.

&#61623; Effectiveness.  The effectiveness of the solutions is critical.  Data on the degree of containment offered by the solution for chemical or bio-hazardous substances should be provided.  If bio-hazard test strips or decontamination methods are proposed, both the false positive and false negative rates should be low.  

&#61623; Collection Box Types.  Solutions must deal with all collection box types:  Types include:

Model	Description				Number in Service
1170-K	Standard collection box				312,000
1170-T	Dual container collection boxes			  
1170-Q, S, V, W	Jumbo boxes					  40,000
1577	Drop slots in post office retail facilities		  30,000

Note:  Many of the collection boxes have 2 insertion points:  the motorist mail chutes (also called ?snorkels?) and the pull-down access door.  Some of the jumbo boxes have snorkels on both sides (no pull-down access door).
&#61623; Environment/Locations.  Most collection boxes are located outdoors, on streets and are subject to all environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, vandalism, etc.).  Drop slots are generally located inside a postal facility.  (Note:  there are many drop slots in non-postal facilities, both residential and office buildings.  At this time, we are not specifically requesting technology for these slots.  However, if adaptable to this environment, a drop slot solution may be expanded to cover this area as well.)


Proposal Submissions

To reach the second step, offerors must provide practical, innovative, and low cost solutions.  Describe the solution(s) fully, using drawings and/or flow charts where helpful.  Include Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates and time schedules.  Oral presentations of selected designs will be requested.  Address the following questions in your proposal (at a minimum):

1. How does the proposal design meet the requirement?
2. What potential hazards are addressed by the proposal?
3. Provide data to support effectiveness of the solution.
4. What data, certifications, etc. are available to prove the solution is safe?
5. Describe the state of the technology -- experimental, conceptual or existing technology.
6. Does the solution use commercial off the shelf or specially designed hardware/software?
7. Are there any constraints for production in quantity?
8. Describe timeline for production in quantity.
9. How will Postal furnished security-sensitive TDPs and equipment be controlled?

<ARCHDATE>03302002
<CONTACT>Shannyn Scassero, 301-619-2640
<DESC>NA The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is seeking an interim solution to supply Patient Therapeutic Quality Oxygen in forward deployed Expeditionary Medical System (EMEDS) Units.  The system currently used to support patient oxygen requ irements in the Air Force Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) and deployed ground units is the Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen System (PTLOX).  This system depends upon the availability of liquid oxygen (LOX) and is labor intensive to support and maintain.  Chan ges in aircraft oxygen systems from LOX dependent systems to On-Board Oxygen Generating Systems (OBOGS) as well as changes in operational deployment of forces has made it difficult to find LOX to support the PTLOX systems in forward deployed areas.  The De ployable Oxygen System (DOS) being developed by the 311th Human systems Wing at Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX, to replace the current AE oxygen support capability is not scheduled for operational deployment until 2006/2007.  Recent events have cre ated an immediate need for ACC to obtain improved systems for patient oxygen supply in forword deployed areas that are not dependent on LOX.  AFMESA is attempting to identify an interim solution that matched, as closely as possible, the Deployable Oxygen G enerating System (DOGS) requirement listed in the DOS Final Operational Requirements Document (ORD) AMC 001-00-B dated 22 AUG 01.  The intent is to identify an interim Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS), or Non-Developmental I tems (NDI) solution that meets immediate ACC EMEDS needs, does not exceed current EMEDS limitations and may be compatible with the future DOS solution.  Special Instructions:  1)  In addition to the requirements listed in the DOS ORD, submissions shall con form to all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for medical devices and US Pharmacopoeia (USP) requirements for hospital grade oxygen; 2) submissions utilizing commercially available or developmental item(s)/solution(s) is encouraged, but the n eed is immediate because developmental requirements will be limited; 3) Government funding is ONLY available for field-testing to ensure submissions meet reliability, maintainability, ruggedness, environmental and compatibility requirements; 4) all submiss ions shall be in writing and include (a) technical specifications, (b) results of any testing perfromed to date, (c) current production schedule/rates, (d) logistics concept, (e) cost data, (f) manufacturing standards, and (g) current users; and 5) all sub missions shall be made to AFMESA, LtCOL Steven Bell, AFMESA, 1054A Patchel Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702, no later than 28 FEB 02.  Questions may be directed to Joe Canonico at (301)619-8136 or joseph.canonico@det.amedd.army.mil The Government understands the potential proprietary nature of all submissions and will take the proper safeguards and security measures commensurate with this effort.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate with and issue a contract to Georgetown University's National Center for Cultural Competence (NCCC) for development, implementation, and follow-up for three summits on the topic of reducing the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in the African American community.   The determination to use other than full and open competition was made in accordance with 41 USC 253(1) since they are the only known source that can accomplish the work described below and achieve the Government's objectives.  The summits will be hosted by the leaders of three predetermined national African American women's organizations and will focus attention on the disparity in SIDS deaths between black and caucasian babies in the United States.  The contractor will build consensus among the leaders of the three hosting organizations as to the goals of the summits, establish summit agendas, coordinate logistics of summit activities, conduct cultural competency training, provide technical assistance to the summit participants, and develop a community guide for replication of the summit model.  The contractor must have extensive content knowledge in the areas of SIDS/infant death and cultural competence in order to design and conduct the summit events and to provide technical assistance to the summit participants. Because the summits are a means of addressing the disparities in infant mortality outcomes, the contractor must have experience in guiding self-assessment of cultural competence in the area of SIDS.  The NICHD contract will require that there be post-summit technical assistance for the summit participants who implement culturally competent SIDS training in their communities.  The contractor must have the experience and capacity to receive and track technical assistance requests and responses.  In this contract, NICHD will require the publication of a community guide to replicating the summit model.  The document will include guidance on implementing culturally competent SIDS training to African American populations in a variety of regions of the United States. The contractor must have the capacity to conduct research, create original publications and products, and disseminate results.  In addition, the contractor must have demonstrated experience in developing and disseminating original community guidance material in the areas of SIDS/infant death and cultural competence.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the proposed study.  An organization capable of performing the task should submit a statement of capabilities (2 copies plus an original) with documentation supporting its ability to perform the work within 45 days of publication of this announcement to: Ms. Lynn Salo, Contract Specialist, CMB, NICHD, 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, MSC, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510.  If sending by Hand carry/Over night mail the last two address lines are 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852.  You may choose to FAX the document to 301-402-3676 or e-mail to ls59u@nih.gov, but you must also send hard copies to the address as listed. (See Note numbered 22)

<DESC>February 1, 2002
REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)

Complete the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the generic amendment addressing essential fish habitat (EFH) requirements for the following fishery management plans of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM):

Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Red Drum Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Stone Crab Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Coral and Coral Reef Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Spiny Lobster Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic 
Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic
	
Action: The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) seeks a contractor to prepare an EIS for the Generic EFH Amendment cited above.

Summary: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Council published a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the Generic EFH Amendment on March 19, 2001 (66 FR 15405).  The Council and NMFS held 7 scoping meetings in June 2001 to obtain public comment on the EFH issues and fishery and non-fishery issues that should be discussed in the EIS (66 FR 30866).  The Generic EFH Amendment was prepared in response to the provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).  The Generic EFH Amendment identifies and describes EFH for the species managed under the Council?s fishery management plans (FMPs).  It also discusses threats to EFH from both fishing and non-fishing activities, discusses EFH conservation and enhancement opportunities, and identifies habitat areas of particular concern (HAPCs) (66 FR 13363).  NMFS approved the identification of EFH for only the 26 selected species for which life history distribution information was available (and which represented over 95 percent of the biomass harvested).  NMFS approved the assessment of impacts on EFH from the use of only three types of gear (trawls, recreational fishing gear, and traps/pots), and noted that impacts on EFH by other gear used in the GOM should be considered in subsequent amendments as more information becomes available.  Based on a court ruling from a legal challenge by a coalition of environmental groups and fishermen?s associations (American Oceans Campaign [AOC] v. Daley), the Council (and NMFS) propose to replace the environmental assessment (EA) of the Generic EFH Amendment with an EIS prepared by contract issued under this RFP (see background discussion in Statement of Work).

TO APPLY:

A copy of the complete RFP (13 pages) is available and can be requested: (1) from the Council?s web page at http://www.gulfcouncil.org;(2) e-mail at gulfcouncil@gulfcouncil.org;(3) phone at 813-228-2815; (4) FAX at 813-225-7015; or (5) regular mail at Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 3018 North Highway 301, Suite 1000, Tampa, Florida, 33619.  All proposals must be received by 5:00 p.m. EST February 28, 2002.

<SUBJECT>A -- POTENTIAL CONCEPT INFORMATION SOUGHT
<DESC>Recent world events have highlighted the value of a sustained capability to provide very precise application of firepower to support warfighter operations.  Currently this capability is provided through the AC-130 gunship.  Gunships combine sensors and weapons on an aero platform with the ability to loiter for long periods of time, providing sustained and very precise, tailorable application of firepower in a low threat environment.    

At the request of the Air Force Chief of Staff, AFMC is undertaking a 90-day analysis to explore options to improve the lethality, survivability, and connectivity of a future sustained capability to provide very precise, tailorable application of firepower.  This analysis will include exploring methods to more closely integrate Gunship missions with traditional Combat Air Force missions such as Close Air Support.   We are requesting industry's support in answering these very important questions.   Suggestions/ideas should be formulated/presented as follows:

Near (FY03 - FY05) and mid (FY06 - FY10) term enhancements to improve effectiveness and flexibility of the current capabilities and systems

Mid and far (FY10 and beyond) term concepts (including new platforms) to meet the future desired effects 

The key technologies and demonstrations required to mature the future concepts

If the results of this initial 90-day analysis look promising, the Air Force intends to launch an analysis of alternatives to further define the future precision engagement/strike capability.

Using the Air Force Modernization Planning Process, HQ AFSOC has defined the deficiencies and limitations of the current AC-130 gunships.    These findings are documented in AFSOF 2030.

When looking towards the future the Air Force requests you "open the box" as much as possible.   Solutions might include more than one platform (manned, unmanned, and space), deployment of advanced munitions, and a highly interconnected information environment to accomplish the mission. 

The Air Force intends to sponsor an Industry Day on 20 February 2002 at Eglin Air Force Base Conference Center to more fully describe the capability desired.    Following this Industry Day we will be looking for your new ideas/concepts.  One-on-one sessions will be scheduled immediately after the Industry Day on 20 and 21 February to discuss new concepts that are not already in AFSOF 2030. Additional one-on-one sessions are tentatively scheduled for 13-14 March. Concepts can include complete weapon systems solutions or solutions that address only key areas.   One-on-one sessions for 20 and 21 February may be scheduled through the point of contact identified below.

This announcement is to conduct market research and is not to be interpreted as intent to award a contact.   Participation in this effort is entirely voluntary and creates no obligation of any nature on either the government or the participants.   Information divulged during any sessions will be treated in confidence (similar to proposal information) if entitled to such protection and so identified by the participants.  This does not include information already within the knowledge or possession of the government or otherwise publicly available.  Point of Contact:  Major Robert Campbell, Program Manager, Phone (850) 882-6982 ext 6082, Fax (850) 882-6984, Email campberg@eglin.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- MEASUREMENT OF PEROXYACYL NITRATES & ALKYL NITRATES
<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Western Michigan State University to perform atmospheric measurements of organic nitrates on board the NOAA RV Ronald H. Brown, during New England Air Quality Study in the summer of 2002.  The ambient concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN), and peroxymethacroyl nitrate (MPAN) will be quantified during a four-week cruise beginning on July 12, 2002.  The data collected will be used to determine, 1) the contribution of these organic nitrates to total reactive oxides of nitrogen; 2) the effect of NOy concentration on the rate of formation of organic nitrates; and 3) the relative contribution of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions of organics to formation of ozone in the region.  The measurement results and their interpretation will be published in the peer-reviewed literature within two years.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under 100K).  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.
