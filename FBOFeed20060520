<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Office for Grants and Training (G&T) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of multi-sensor meter (MSM) chemical detectors to validate their employment and effectiveness when used by first responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other hazardous environments.  These MSM chemical detectors are more commonly known as multi-gas monitors.  G&T’s Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP is inviting manufacturers to provide information.  This information will be included in the market research conducted regarding MSM chemical detectors, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP MSM chemical detector focus group and assessment. 

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response.  The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) endorse any product or manufacturer.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment both as a responder wearing Level A personal protective equipment (PPE).  The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator.  Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, address, point of contact, telephone, fax and email address. Additionally, please provide any information available such as the adaptability of the equipment in hazardous environments while wearing Level A PPE, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research and new developments.

Do not send your piece of equipment. Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

Respond by 4:00PM CST on June 5, 2006, by e-mail to Phillis Reid  at Phillis.reid@dhs.gov or Ella Chapman at ella.chapman@dhs.gov; or fax to (256) 847-2323 or by mail to Phillis Reid , Contract Specialist, Center for Domestic Preparedness, P. O. Box 5100, Anniston, AL 36205
