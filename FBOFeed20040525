<CONTACT>Greg Knott Methow Subbasin Liaison 5099970028     ;
<DESC>NA The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Okanogan County Conservation District. The proposed action is to assist The Upper Columbia Area Office (UCA), Bureau of Reclamation (USBR/Reclamation), Department of the Interior  to provide information necessary for the management of the Methow River subbasin.  Reclamation has been directed under the BiOp to work on irrigation-related passage barriers and instream flow issues in the Methow subbasin.  The information provided by these gages will assist in both of these tasks.  Accurate streamflow information is essential during the design and post-construction effectiveness monitoring phases of Reclamation's passage barrier removal projects.  Instream flow acquisition in the Methow requires a verifiable need for increased stream flows.  Low flow areas and the amount of additional water required to mitigate irrigation- related late season low flow issues can only be identified with reliable stream flow information.  The present gaging system in the Methow Subbasin does not provide enough information to satisfy Reclamation's needs in implementing RPA 149.  Each of these gages are linked in some way to an on-going Reclamation project.   The objectives of this contract are to provide data for: Characterization of hydrologic conditions to support Reclamation's participation in instream flow restoration  as endangered species recovery actions,effectiveness monitoring for instream structures designed by Reclamation, designing instream structures as part of the RPA 149 program, evaluating the benefits of possible instream flow acquisitions under RPA 149,identifying, prioritizing, and monitoring salmonid recovery actions in the subbasin.  Benefits The Methow Subbasin provides habitat for anadromous and resident fish, including species listed under the Endangered Species Act, and are also used a source of water for irrigated agriculture.  The information provided by this contract can be used to identify the location and quantity of instream flow needs in the subbasin.  Effectiveness monitoring using this information will lead towards better Reclamation designs of fish passage structures.   Tasks Field Work and Data Collection, Seven (7) stream gages will be read on a regular basis by downloading data loggers installed with the gages for that purpose. Gages will be removed prior to freezing in the fall and re-installed the following spring, An electronic database will be maintained to ensure data retention. Each gage will be rated at least once per year after spring high flows and more often as necessary if changes in channel cross section require. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business June1, 2004 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule. Interested potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to discuss the solicitation.  The Pre-Proposal conference will take place at The Lodge (formerly Jumers), Bettendorf, IA from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2002.  This conference is open to all contractors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services for program and management support prepared in accordance with (IAW) the format in FAR Part 8, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This Request for Quotation (RFQ) is limited to GSA Federal Supply Schedule Holders as defined under FAR Part 8.  

Request for Quotation Number DFMCL4RV031 is attached to this notice.  As FAR Part 8 requirement, all the clauses incorporated in the offeror’s GSA Schedule shall be applicable.

This RFQ is for providing program and management support services to the Defense Finance & Accounting Service, MilPay System Transition Program Office (MSTPO), Cleveland Center.  Please review the RFQ carefully and ensure your response is compliant with all requirements cited in the RFQ.  

The MilPay System Transition Program Office (MSTPO) is responsible for transitioning legacy military pay functionality to the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) Personnel/Pay (Pers/Pay), the objective integrated military personnel and pay system for the Department of Defense (DoD). The pay component of DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) will replace all military pay systems existing at the time of deployment and serve as the single integrated payroll capability for Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard members around the world. DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) is an Acquisition Category I (ACAT I) Program.  DoD Directives relating to the development and acquisition of Major Automated Information Systems (AIS) will be used throughout the DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) life cycle.

Another MSTPO responsibility is the design and development of the Forward Compatible Payroll (FCP) system, the near-term replacement of the Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS).  DJMS is the DFAS system that provides pay support to the Active Duty, Reserve and Guard components of the Army, Navy and Air Force.  Longer term, the new payroll capability, and all associated design documents and materials, will be made available to the DIMHRS (Pers/Pay) program for potential reuse as, or in support of, the payroll component of DIMHRS (Pers/Pay). DoD Directives that apply to an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III) program are being followed during the development and deployment of FCP. 

A third MSTPO initiative is maintenance and enhancement of the Defense MilPay Office (DMO). DMO is a modern end-user application that provides DoD military pay technicians the capability to enter and access pay-related data.  DMO is in the process of replacing several legacy systems currently used to provide input to DJMS and will be the input system for FCP.

It is anticipated that the resulting order will be a base (first) period with four (4) option years.  A firm-fixed price quotation is requested for the effort.  

All quotations will be evaluated according to the factors for selection outlined in the RFQ.  Reply can be made by mail, fax or e-mail to the Contracting Point of Contact (POC) listed.

Questions concerning this RFQ will be accepted through 3:00 PM EDT, June 1, 2004 via e-mail only.  

Quotations will be due 3:00 PM EDT, June 11, 2004.  Quotations received after the above date and time may not be considered for award.

An authorized representative of the Offeror's organization shall sign the letter. If the Offeror is a joint venture, all members shall sign the letter.  (b) Qualification submission requirements and evaluation criteria as described below:  For evaluation purposes, “similar” projects are defined as new construction or alteration/renovation of the same approximate size, scope and complexity completed or currently in progress where substantial progress has been made, within the past seven (7) years.  While the Government will consider past performance in delivery and management of any size or type space, primary consideration will be given to similar work.  Similar work is defined as construction of the same or greater quantity and complexity as proposed for this procurement; construction using the same basic building materials and systems (architectural, mechanical, electrical, fire and life safety, etc.); and construction designed for the same general use as this procurement.
  
Factor 1: Past Performance/Prior Experience  
Factor Description:  a.  This factor considers the quality of the Offeror’s prior experience and past performance in carrying out work of a similar nature with respect to construction.  Consideration will be given to success in areas of technical quality, delivery, timeliness, and budget maintenance.  The definition of “similar projects” for evaluation purposes is described above.  Each project evaluated need not have all the elements of similarity to be considered.  However, the Offeror must demonstrate, through a combination of projects, similar construction experience.  Prior experience of the offeror's principals (President, Vice President, etc.) may be used to qualify the offeror, but only where the principal has acquired the experience while serving as a principal of the offeror or another firm.
b.  Past performance information to be evaluated includes timeliness of delivery/performance, including adherence to contract schedules and timely submission or performance of required tests and submittals; resolution of disputes and delays, number of “show cause” letters and cure notices issued, number of contract extensions resulting from contractor-caused delays; conformance to contract requirements, including quality of workmanship, timeliness, and adequacy of correction of deficiencies, number and extent to warranty problems; on-the-job safety performance record including the number of lost or restricted workdays due to occupational injuries in comparison to the national average; compliance with key contract provisions (e.g., subcontracting program, labor standards, safety standards, reporting requirements, etc.); the Offeror’s history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.
c.  GSA Evaluators will contact a minimum of three (3) projects that have similar scope, requirements, and/or complexity to the projects addressed by this RFQ.  Evaluators may consider performance on contracts which are not submitted by the Offeror if they have knowledge of them.  The same basic questions shall be asked of each reference contacted.  The interviews shall be documented to indicate who called for GSA, who was interviewed, questions asked, and answers provided.  
Submittal Requirement:  The Offeror and all of the Offeror's key personnel must submit projects in which they have had a primary role in the performance of services within their respective disciplines in three (3) multi story commercial office buildings, involving similar work per building, within the past seven (7) years.  The Government has the right not to consider further any offer that fails to submit the required project information.  Each Offeror's key personnel must have performed on three (3) projects, and each shall submit the information on their project individually.  Each of the projects submitted must include the completed "Past Performance" questionnaire attached to this RFQ and a narrative of not more than five (5) typewritten, single spaced pages, one 8" wide x 10" high photograph, and project references with current contacts and telephone numbers for each project discussed.  The narrative must 1) include sufficient information to show that the project discussed had similar scope, requirements, and/or complexity to the project described in this RFQ and 2) address the questions posed in the "Past Performance" questionnaire.  The Government has the right to consider information it receives affecting the past performance of the offeror and/or offeror’s key personnel even though the information was not provided by the offeror and/or the offeror’s key personnel 
Standard for Evaluation:   The standard is met when the Offeror demonstrates a continuing history of successful project completion.  The Offeror has performed satisfactorily or better on all similar projects as evidenced by references contacted that also indicate they would contract with the offeror again for the same or similar work.

In order to be considered satisfactory, the offeror must have completed the work on-time with respect to intermediate completion targets, as well as total project completion goals, within budget and with no major technical problems or complaints which clearly resulted from deficiency in materials or work quality within the control of the construction contractor and in accordance with contract requirements. The offeror has not initiated an excessive number of unwarranted or frivolous requests for change orders.

Factor 2:  Principal Team Member Qualifications 
 Factor Description: a.   This factor considers construction experience, education, knowledge, and expertise of all the Principal Team Members (PTM).  For the purpose of this section, PTM is defined as:  The offeror’s principal in charge who must be an officer and/or owner of the Offering Entity, with at least seven (7) years experience in commercial office construction or renovation.  The principal-in-charge shall have the ability to make legal commitments on behalf of the Offeror and shall be responsible for all aspects of the project team.  Experience shall be demonstrated through submission of no less than three (3) projects.

b.  Consideration will be given to the following:  1) currently held position/title, 2) proposed project position/title, 3) education, 4) professional licensing and awards, and 5) relevant work experience over the past seven (7) years of PTM who will be assigned directly to the project.

If role statements are not provided, it will be assumed that there is no significant project involvement.  The Offeror's key personnel defined as the principals of the Offeror, contractor or construction manager cannot change after receipt of Phase One offers without the written approval of the GSA Contracting Officer.  Notification and submittal of a change in the Offeror's key personnel must be timely to allow for proper evaluation by the Government.

REFERENCES.  The Government intends to contact those individuals and firms that are listed as references by the offeror to verify that the offeror’s characterization of its involvement is accurate, and to solicit their assessments of the quality of those services that were provided.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to verify that all references listed can be reached by telephone.  If a reference cannot be located based upon the information provided by the offeror, the Government is not required to consider the listed project.  If the Government cannot obtain past performance information from a sufficient number of general contractors, then the Government may find a proposal unacceptable. The Government is not required to contact all references provided, but will contact a sufficient number of references from each offeror to ascertain a reasonable determination of the Offeror’s Prior Experience and Past Performance. 

COMPLETENESS OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION.  Failure to list required project information under the past performance criteria stated above may be grounds for drawing a negative inference as to an offeror’s qualifications or responsibility, and may result in a determination that proposal is not acceptable.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open only to construction 8(a) firms with a bona fide Washington State office.  The Government intends for the Large 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $25,000.  The $25,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $125 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $150 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000,000 and $6,000,000.  Note, an additional 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $100,000 to $1,500,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
     Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.

     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
      The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
     Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.

 SUDAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM (SIP)

NOTIFICATION OF FUTURE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP)

USAID's Sudan Field Office announces its intention to invite proposals for the implementation a new Sudan Infrastructure Program (SIP).  The new program fits within the approved Sudan Interim Strategic Plan (ISP), 2004-2006.  The program will achieve one over-arching result: "Infrastructure Improved", which is identical to sub-intermediate result 8.3.3 in the Sudan Interim Strategic Plan, 2000-2004.  This result will be achieved through four program components: the Capacity-Building Component, through which Southern Sudanese rehabilitation delivery systems will be made more capable; the Design and Analysis Component, through which rehabilitation best practices will be brought to Southern Sudan; the Construction Component, through which critical infrastructure will be rehabilitated via transparent civil works projects; and the Program Start-Up and Management Component, which will ensure accountability and quality control for civil works projects.  

The contractor will achieve the contract performance measures and complete all contract deliverables within three of these components.  Within the Capacity-Building Component, activities will include establishing Southern Sudanese infrastructure rehabilitation agencies and making them operational; improving Southern Sudanese policymaking capabilities; providing training and tools for counties’ road maintenance; and providing technical and business training for Southern Sudanese construction firms.  Within the Design and Analysis Component, activities will include surveys, maps and designs for road rehabilitation; feasibility studies and pilot projects for electrification and telecommunications; and performance monitoring and analytical support.  Within the Construction Component, activities will include public tender processes for civil works projects; and rehabilitation of high priority trunk roads, critical feeder roads, and river transport systems.  

USAID will implement the Program Start-up and Management Component.  Activities will include inspections by USAID engineers; and external audits and evaluations of civil works projects, construction firms, and the Southern Sudanese roads agencies.  USAID will undertake a number of SIP start-up activities during the third and fourth quarters of FY 2004.  

Specific expected end of program results include the following:  the cost of transport between the three regions of Southern Sudan will be measurably decreased;  65 counties will start road maintenance programs led by trained road technicians; Southern Sudanese infrastructure agencies will be operational; Southern Sudanese infrastructure policy framework will be established; 1000 kilometers of roads will be rehabilitated; and feasibility studies will be completed and pilots launched for small-scale power utilities and telecommunications services.  

The Request for Proposals (RFP) is projected to be issued 2 weeks from this notice. USAID will not entertain questions until after the RFP is issued.  The Sudan Infrastructure Program (SIP) Authorization Package provides a description of the SIP Program and is hereby incorporated in this Statement of Work.  The SIP Authorization Package will be made available on line when the RFP is released.  
It is the responsibility of the party downloading the RFP to ensure that it has been received in its entirety, and USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from the transmission or conversion process. When the RFP is issued, any amendments thereof will be posted on the internet, and interested parties should check the website regularly. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award. 

USAID/SUDAN anticipates issuance of the RFP on June 8th  with a closing date of Aug 6th 2004.

<DESC>CLINICAL CENTERS FOR A CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE LUNG INJURY AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

This is not a request for proposals.  It is anticipated that RFP-NHLBI-HR-05-04 for ten Clinical Centers (CCs) for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Clinical Research Network for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) will be available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/ funding/index.htm on or about June 10, 2004.  NHLBI will release a separate Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) as RFP-NHLBI-HR-05-05, on or about June 1, 2004. The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials under multiple protocols for the prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS.  The ARDSNet will function with a Steering Committee (SC) of principal investigators from the CCs and the CCC, and a representative of the NHLBI.  The SC will collaboratively develop, prioritize, and conduct the clinical trials.  The CCs, each consisting of one or more participating Intensive Care Units (ICUs), will enroll a total of 1650 subjects over five and one-half years of a seven-year project.  The actual number of clinical trials will depend upon availability of funds.  Initial Network protocol(s) may be selected from among those proposed by offerors that successfully compete as a CC.  Patient enrollment will consist of appropriate gender and minority representation.  It is recognized that offerors will be limited by the patient population that is admitted in intensive care units, which is determined by the demographics of the local population.  Offerors must address in detail the gender and racial characteristics of their patient population.  Funding decisions may be made with the objective of obtaining a trial-wide patient mix which includes 51% women and 25% minorities.  To achieve enrollment of 30 patients per year, offerors may involve affiliated institutions or hospitals, and/or enter into formal agreements with other institutions.  If necessary, collaborations within a local geographic area are encouraged to facilitate communication and oversight by the PI.  CC staff will be expected to participate in one or more of a number of subcommittees (e.g., publications, ethics, pathology, natural history, and progress assessment) which will hold meetings and teleconferences on an as-needed basis.  CC investigators will attend SC meetings approximately semiannually and participate in teleconferences monthly to discuss progress of the trials, identify concerns about the protocols and/or conduct of the trials, and determine whether changes to the protocols and other trial forms are necessary.  The PI will be responsible for overseeing the quality of patient screening, enrollment, and care, and for achieving a minimum enrollment of 30 ALI/ARDS patients per year.  The PI will have responsibility for maintaining regular communications within his/her CC.  The PI and co-PI will be expected to make intellectual contributions to the development, conduct, and monitoring of trials.  CC personnel will be expected to participate in the development of appropriate and feasible sub-studies.  The project will conclude activities with the submission of final abstracts and manuscripts for publication and presentation, and completion of final limited access data sets by the CCC.  The Government intends to award ten contracts for a period of seven years, on or about September 1, 2005.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/NIH is planning to award a contract for coordinating a clinical trial of (13) pediatric pharmacology research units (PPRU) and some obstetric pharmacology research units (OPRU).  Thirteen sites at children’s hospital were selected to carry out the overall objectives of facilitating and promoting the pediatric labeling of new drugs or drug already on the market.  Labeling of drugs requires close interaction among trial sites, the pharmaceutical company sponsor and the Food and Drug Administration.  In addition to studies for pediatric labeling the Network performs research studies in pharmacogenomics, ontogeny of drug metabolizing enzymes and receptors and biomarker identification and validation.  To accomplish its mission the Network must closely work with the pharmaceutical industry.  The PPRU Network conducts two types of studies: 1) Studies originating from pharmaceutical companies and 2) Investigator-initiated studies without a pharmaceutical company sponsorship.  The data coordinating center must be capable of: 1) developing and maintaining start-up, progress, completion, reports, summaries and labeling status of all drugs involved in Network protocols; 2) developing quarterly, annual, and customized reports; 3) preparing and maintaining of operating documents, policies and procedures; 4) archiving of data, developing and maintaining of clinical management system, developing of standardized Case Report Forms (CRFs); 5) preparation of IND applications and submission of required FDA reports; 6) developing and maintaining of computerized system for electronic submission of data.  The CC will be involved in the management of multi-site investigator-initiated protocols.  Small Businesses that believe they can perform these functions may request a copy of the Request for Proposal.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541710.  The Request for Proposal NICHD-2004-09 will be available on or about June 14, 2004 at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  The proposal submission due date for the RFP is September 14, 2004.  The request for RFP should be sent to:   Ms. Mya N. Hlaing, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, NICHD, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD, Suite 7A-07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD 20892-7510.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.   A firm, fixed-price purchase order with not-to-exceed line items is anticipated to result from  the award of this solicitation consisting of a twelve month base period and two twelve month options. This procurement is for flight services in support of a remote sensing program along Connecticut, Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts shores. 1.0 Background. The U.S. EPA's National Health and  Environmental Effects Research Laboratory- Atlantic Ecology Division (AED) in  Narragansett, Rhode Island has embarked on a multi-year research program aimed at developing empirical nitrogen load-response models for embayments in southern New England. This is part of a national effort to develop  nutrient load-response models for coastal systems under the Aquatic Stressors framework. The national program is developing these models with water quality indicators related to hypoxia, food web change, and Submerged AquaticVegetation loss. In support of the research program, AED is making  measurements along the Connecticut, Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts coastlines. Food web change is being assessed using remotely sensed estimates of chlorophyll a as a biomass indicator for phytoplankton. The field techniques and data used for the research program will be adapted and  transferred to coastal environmental managers to aid in the development and implementation of nitrogen water quality standards for coastal marine systems.  2.0 Scope or Objective Statement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires contractor support to provide survey flights for  approximately 30 estuarine systems along the southern New England coastline from Greenwich, Connecticut - Cape Cod, Massachusetts in support of remote sensing to monitor concentrations of chlorophyll a using multispectral data.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would evaluate and design a central monitoring and control system for water supply for the region, including SCADA, in conjunction with the ongoing $1.4 billion Sardar Sarovar Canal Based Water Supply Project.

Gujarat is located in western India and has historically been one of the driest regions of the country.  Average annual rainfall in the western region is estimated to be 1,137 cubic meters per capita, far below the national average. Gujarat receives only about 427 cubic meters per capita.  In response to the needs of these communities, the Gujarat Water Supply & Sewerage Board (GWSSB) intends to supply water for some of the most arid regions of Gujarat through the Sardar Sarovar Canal-Based Water Supply Project.  The proposed project will supply nearly 2,272 million liters of water per day to an estimated population of 29 million residents in the year 2021. Besides domestic uses, the project will also supply 671 million liters per day of water for industrial use in this region.  This constant supply of water could help alleviate the economic and social costs of cyclical droughts that have wreaked havoc on the local economy and decreased the standard of living for poor rural residents. The estimated cost of the project is $1.4 billion.

The Sardar Sarovar Canal-Based Water Supply Project has formulated a master plan for drawing water from the Narmada Canal to provide water to areas with higher scarcity levels.  While some work has been performed through local consultants to design a central system able to monitor and control distribution elements of the Sardar Sarovar Canal-Based Water Supply Project, GWSSB has requested USTDA funding for a feasibility study that would provide a more thorough analysis of the control and SCADA systems.  They have stressed the need to incorporate the most recent available technologies and international best practices into the system design.  The estimated cost for the monitoring and control system is $25 million.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the feasibility study would include the following components:

Task 1 - Data collection and review
Task 2 - System definition
Task 3 - Needs analysis

<DESC>The WR-ALC Support Equipment Commodity Council (WR-ALC/LEP) proposes to enter an agreement with Honeywell Inc to support known sole source requirements identified as a result of the data analysis performed on the identified Federal Stock Classes (FSC) associated with the Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC).  The SECC has been assigned 92 different FSCs that will be supported by various different strategic acquisition strategies.  A Justification and Approval has been approved for this corporate contract IAW FAR 6.302-1.  The class J&A approves the use of a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) which will include procedures supporting decentralized ordering.  WR-ALC/LEP will remain the primary management agency of the BOA.  This proposed action will be written as part of the SECC effort established under the AF Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) initiative.  

The items to be purchased include various categories of components and will have a current Acquisition Method Code (AMC) of 3, 4 or 5 assigned in accordance with the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program, as outlined in DFARS Appendix E.  Repair items will be identified by the Sole Source Repair Selection Process (SSRSP), which incorporates 50/50 and Source of Repair Assignment Process statutory requirements.  The SSRSP will ensure that only sole source contract repair items are placed on these BOA orders.  Research of repair sources will include evaluation of repair method code screening of DoD vendor breakout, reviews of the D043 Master Item Identification Control System, and reviews of the Execution and Prioritization of Repair Support System (EXPRESS) as appropriate.  The items that will be included in the Honeywell BOA have been identified as sole source in accordance with these established procedures.

A review of potential national stock numbers to be included with this action has revealed that there is no available data to support an action except to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the items currently identified as sole source to Honeywell Inc.  However, procedures have been established for the purpose of screening any items that may be identified as sole source in the future.  Additionally, if in the future data is either purchased or becomes available to the Government, items will be deleted from this requirement and may be offered for competition as appropriate.  

Orders may be issued against the BOA for which appropriate sole source documentation demonstrates that Honeywell Inc. is the OEM for the action contemplated.  The type of orders issued may include spares, repair, engineering services, Logistics Sustainment Modifications/Services, and/or Data.  The BOA will be valid for a total period of nine years.  The basic period of performance will be for three years, and will include two, three-year options.  The estimated dollar value of this action for the proposed period of performance is estimated at $457.7 million.  This estimate represents the analysis performed for the initial items identified as supported by the SECC.

BOA orders issued will vary in duration and by type of effort to be performed.  Each BOA order will identify all appropriate quantities, period of performance, funding source, and any special terms and conditions, which may include performance based logistics performance measurements.

The purpose of this BOA is to establish an enterprise-wide vehicle that will support known sole source actions with Honeywell Inc.  Any contractor expressing an interest in the effort will be recommended to Honeywell Inc. for consideration as a sub-contractor or a partner, as appropriate per Honeywell determination.

This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all items supported by the approved SECC scope.  It is only representative of the initial analysis performed.  Other items/systems that may be included in the future may require synopsis on an individual basis.  The major support equipment currently identified in the initial SECC analysis includes the following (and all sole-source components thereof):

4920-01-288-6790KV – F-15 Tactical Electronic Warfare Intermediate Support System (TISS);

4920-01-152-6253KV – AN/USM-603 Electronic Test Set;

F-15E Mobile Electronics Test Set -	6625-01-286-8798KV***

A letter Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued to support this action.  Contract award is anticipated in Sep 04.  The BOA will establish appropriate terms and conditions, negotiated rates for cost type actions, and formula pricing for spares and repairs as appropriate.  Multiple pricing arrangements will be included in the BOA.  Fixed prices will be negotiated to the maximum extent practical.  Various Honeywell CAGE codes will be evaluated and pricing information used as appropriate for each location.

If any source is interested in partnering or sub-contracting opportunities, the identified PCO should be contacted.  All sources expressing interest will be included in the contract file and all available information provided to the PCO will be forwarded to the appropriate Honeywell organization for reference and evaluation.

If additional information regarding the specific NSNs that will initially be included in this BOA is required, it may be obtained by contacting the identified PCO.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), contemplates sole source negotiations with Kunitz and Associates, Inc. (KAI), 6001 Montrose Road, Suite 920, Rockville, MD under existing contract N01-NS-2-2343 for continued support of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke (SPOTRIAS).  The current contract with KAI is entitled Center for Clinical Trial Management Resources and requires support for management with monitoring clinical trials, tracking Institute-supported clinical projects, developing a classification system for research projects, and providing statistical and methodological support.  The SPOTRIAS project will require KAI to continue performing all of the aforementioned tasks.  Activities shall include, but are not limited to, data auditing for data retrieved from existing research grants from the SPOTRIAS centers, site visits to evaluate data entry and retrieval for the common database within the SPOTRIAS projects, statistical support for analysis of common projects, and archiving for clinical research data of national importance.  A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  KAI has been determined to be the only responsible source because of the staff’s familiarity with the various on-going clinical trials and SPOTRIAS projects supported by the NINDS.  KAI is in the most optimal position to provide this work in a timely and cost-effective manner.  This organization has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for the additional labor effort unfeasible.  This is neither a formal solicitation nor an announcement that a RFP is available.  See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The IRS intends to award a sole source contract to Bowe Bell & Howell (BB&H) for a potential base period (12 months) and 4 1-year Option Periods for maintenance and repair services for Multi-Functional Document Handling Systems (MDHS) at the nine (9) IRS Submission Processing Campuses (SPC) (formerly referred to as Service Centers).  The MDHS is a BB&H Mail-Star 500 Inserter.  This BB&H equipment contains proprietary software, firmware, hardware, and electronic system designs for processing mail on a daily basis.

The Base Period will require that two MDHS units be maintained at the Fresno SPC and Kansas City SPC.  With the exercise of Option Period l, the requirement will revert to 1 MDHS per each of these locations.  The maintenance and repair services at the Andover, Atlanta, Memphis and Philadelphia will be one (1) MDHS per SPC for the Base Period and all 4 1-Year Option Periods.  The MDHS units at the Austin, Cincinnati, and Ogden SPCs will require only Unscheduled On-Call maintenance.  The Inserters are used to cut, fold, insert, out-sort file, and sort finished mail pieces by weight.  These systems are used in the main stream processing of tax returns and related taxpayer correspondence, thereby making their scheduled operation critical to the overall continued tax processing flow within each IRS SPC's daily outgoing mail.  This requirement is for: (1) one (1) certified contractor field Customer Service Engineer (CSE) at the six (6) IRS SPCs and On Call Services at the remaining three SPCs, for an eight (8) hour shift.  Hours will depend on the site requirement; (2) three (3) dedicated support engineers located at the contractor's plant; (3) other plant support personnel with proprietary experience on all MDHS software, firmware, and hardware, plus other MDHS maintenance support services; and (4) MDHS "equivalent" test system and special field support at the contractor's plant.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement IN WRITING ONLY.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command's (USASMDC) Office of Technical Integration and Interoperability (OTII), Huntsville, Alabama desires to award a sole source contract to expend on the efforts completed under contract, DASG60-01-C-0027, an d continue development of a Non-Tactical Low Cost Interceptor(LCI).  The past three (3) years OTII has been developing a proof-of-concept missile design for a lower-cost, long-range interceptor to defeat the unsophisticated air-breathing threat such as 1st  and 2nd generation cruise missiles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This LCI effort will require the contractor to continue the system engineering process and conduct necessary integration and testing that takes the current LCI design to a system Critical Design Review (CDR) milestone.  The contractor will be required to c omplete subsystem efforts in airframe, control system, seeker, propulsion, navigation system, warhead, flight termination system, avionics, and conduct subsystem CDRs prior to the system CDR.  Once the system CDR has been achieved, the contractor will be r equired to procure components and subsystems, develop necessary software, conduct necessary testing to validate system performance, and integrate these subsystems into a flight worthy missile.  The contractor will be required to develop a surrogate launch system that includes launch control equipment, fire control system, launch platform, and associate software to safely conduct a test and obtain flight data.  The contractor will be required to conduct a controlled flight test at a government established te st flight range and verify flight performance against established performance requirements. Pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), USASMDC plans to award a basic contract with options to MILTEC Corporation of Huntsville, Alabama.  Due to MILTEC's prior work in the design and engineering of the LCI, USASMDC believes that MILTEC i s the only source which is capable of performing the LCI effort in a timely and cost effective manner.  The LCI builds on the prior work of MILTEC, and USASMDC believes that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of effort, cau se a program delay in educating another source would result in substantial duplication of effort, cause a program delay in educating another source on the efforts conducted to date, and additional costs to the government which would not be recovered throug h competition.  The LCI effort is anticipated to be awarded for Fiscal Year 2004 and performanced in Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008.  A SECRET facility clearance is required for this effort.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) has a requirement to conduct an economic analysis to measure benefits of right whale protection in the Northwest Atlantic. The purpose of this contract is to attain the services of a contractor with expertise in non-market valuation methods (contingent valuation, contingent choice methods or experimental economics) to develop a long-term study/strategic plan that includes an economic measure of willingness-to-pay (WTP) for right whale protection.  The overall study effort will be divided into three main phases:  Phase 1 (Year 1) - Pre-design; Phase 1 (Year 2) - Design survey instrument (optional); Phase 2 - Survey implementation (optional); and Phase 3  - Final analysis of survey data and final report (optional).  Phase 1 encompasses the development of a research team and design of a survey instrument to the point where it can be implemented in Phase 2.  Phase 1 will be spread over a two-year period with the second year optional.   The goal of the first year pilot project, the pre-design step, is to specify the overall design of a long-term project to be conducted at a later date (i.e. the actual survey).  The pre-design step also includes assistance in designing a non-market valuation study that would allow NMFS to use the derived WTP estimates in some benefit-cost type of analysis.  After the pre-design phase is complete, feasibility of the study assessed, and the scope of the long-term project is developed, NMFS will determine whether the additional research will be implemented.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling
1-800-333-0505.  A copy of the solicitation will be attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file on or about May 25, 2004.  A hard copy of the solicitation will only be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Offers received by July 2, 2004 will be considered for award.  Numbered Note 1 applies.  THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO CORRECT THE PRECEDING STATEMENT.  NUMBERED NOTE 1 DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS ACQUISITION.  THE CLASSIFICATION IS UNRESTRICTED.

<DESC>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY and Proposal Release Notification Letter for USNDC Phase 3 has been posted to the PIXS web site.   RFP RELEASE - The Request for Proposal for the US NDC Phase 3 has been  released.  The RFP and all applicable documents including RFP attachments have  been posted to the PIXS web site.  Responses to the RFP are due 25 Jun 2004.   Questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Nancy Williamson, 321- 494-1795, nancy.williamson@patrick.af.mil. INDUSTRY DAY NOTICE The US NDC Phase 3 Industry Day is scheduled for 23 January 2004.  This virtual  industry day is open to all interested parties.  Representatives from  Contracting, Program Management, and Requirements will be available to take  questions.  Interested parties must sign up for the US NDC Phase 3 Industry Day  on the MarketSpace website, https://www.mrpc.wpafb.af.mil/mktspace/ not later  than close of business 21 January 2004.  After logging in to the MarketSpace  website with your e-mail address (you will need to create a password if you are  a new user), click on "Register for an Event" in the left hand column.  Select  the US NDC Phase 3 Industry Day - 1/23/04 and click on "Register."  This  completes the registration process on the MarketSpace website. The Government  team will then notify each interested party with further instructions including  website and login instructions.  During Industry Day each participant will  login during their alloted 30 minute segment of time to ask questions or  provide comments.   PRE-SOLICITATION  NOTICE 1.  The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date. Contact Information:  Ms. Nancy Williamson, Contracting Officer, ASC/RAKPM,  321.757.1795,  e-mail: nancy.williamson@ patrick.af.mil.

The prototype airship developed under this effort will be capable of continuous and controlled flight for a minimum of seven days on station while carrying 500 pounds of payloads with 3kW of power to the payload.  This vehicle is intended as a developmental step toward an objective vehicle that can self deploy from the continental United States to worldwide locations.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain industry concepts and market information for the aforementioned vehicle.  This RFI is not a commitment by the Government or a solicitation (Request for Proposal).  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this RFI.  A follow-on RFP/solicitation does not exist at this time.

The first section should include information identifying the company, point-of-contact, corporate capabilities and experience in less than 10 pages in relation to the following criteria: (1) Prime (Team Lead) must be a United States Corporation; (2) Demonstration of Relevant Experience with Lighter Than Air (LTA) vehicles or programs which operate above 60,000 feet; (3) Corporate Experience with Advanced Technology Integration Projects; and (4) Past Performance References (Government or commercial) for this type of work within the last 5 years.  All experience submitted must be relevant.  The second section should include the vehicle technical description in sufficient detail for the Government to evaluate the adequacy, completeness and maturity of the design.  Provide comments on the reasonableness and feasibility of the schedule, identify technical constraints, and discuss technology readiness level (TRL) goals.  The technical section is limited to twenty-five (25) pages.  Government personnel and MDA contractor support personnel will review all responses.

<DESC>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is conducting market research in preparation for the re-competition of contract 01-C-0334 with Verizon Wireless.  This contract is scheduled to expire on 12/31/2005. The contract provides for wireless voice and data services in the Washington, DC national capital region for approximately 3,000 devices. [Please note that the contract does NOT include Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems and services.] 

Services under the current contract are provided through the DOJ DMS-100 NORTEL class 5 switch which is connected to a mobile telephone switch office (MTSO) via ISDN PRI facilities.  This infrastructure is utilized for least cost routing, five digit dialing between the DOJ land line and wireless phones using DOJ centrex numbers.  The PRI facilities also provide integration to the DOJ Avaya voice mail system and DOJ wireless phones.  

The purpose of this market research is to learn more about current and emerging capabilities and business practices in the wireless industry.  Vendors wishing to participate in this market research are requested to submit information addressing the following topics: new features/services; current and emerging technologies; best practices for reducing the overall cost of service; capability of reducing the number of wireless devices (cell phones, pagers, blackberries, PDAs) required by individual users; availability of Wireless Priority Service (WPS), security, national foot print, performance metrics related to quality of service and customer service, voice and data area coverage including in-building coverage; data speeds; consolidated billing; and, commercial pricing.  Information should be submitted to Pamela Pilz at Pamela.F.Pilz@usdoj.gov or to Ms. Pilz’s attention at 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, NPB 1000, Washington, DC 20530.  All information should be submitted by June 11, 2004.

DOJ will use information received in response to this request for planning purposes only.  This request for information is not to be construed as a commitment by DOJ to procure any items or services, nor for DOJ to pay for the information received.  After reviewing responses, DOJ may request to meet with individual vendors to complete its research.  The determination to conduct market research meetings with individual vendors and which vendors may be requested to participate in such meetings, is solely at the discretion of DOJ.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is using this sources sought synopsis to encourage exchange of information with industry concerning transformation of current Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) capabilities into a force protection system capable of engaging air and surface threats. The Marine Corps desires to identify potential solutions and gather technical and cost information to plan and budget for this capability. The system should be capable of detection, identification and engagement of traditional and asymmetric air and ground threats (ultra-lights, unmanned aerial vehicles, private aircraft, cruise missiles, helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, pickup trucks and/or vans armed with explosives, fixed emplacements, and boats, etc.). The following are the tentative requirements of the system: (a) The system must support operational concepts such as Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW), Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM), and Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS); (b) It should be modular, scalable and capable of meeting distributed operational requirements (a man-portable capability is desirable); (c) The system’s primary role will be in support of Ground-to-Air (G-A) missions, with a secondary role supporting Ground-to-surface (G-G) missions; (d) The system shall be capable of operation in all environmental conditions, day and night. (e) The system must be capable of surviving environments associated with air drop (e.g. thermal shock, pressure change, moisture/condensation penetration, water submersion, shock and vibration); (f) The system must be sufficiently ruggedized to withstand and/or be protected from the abrasive effects (e.g. pitting and scratching) and the penetration of blowing sand and dust particles while operating. The design of the system should also prohibit the penetration of water, moisture, condensation, and salt spray; (g) The system must be fully capable of conducting worldwide operations in conventional and contingency combat operations including tactical nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare environments. It should be designed for use with mission oriented protective posture clothing level (4) and also compatible with current protective helmets and masks; (h) The system must have provisions for use with an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. The IFF must work in Joint, Interagency, and Multinational (JIM) environments; (i) The system shall comply with applicable safety, health and human engineering requirements and shall not present uncontrolled safety and health hazards to personnel; (j) The system should provide for interface compatibility with current air and ground sensors; (k) The system needs to be compatible w/existing and future USMC/Joint organizations. The system must be capable of functioning as a node in the future net-centric environment. There is no funded requirement at this time. However, it is the Government's intent to encourage exchange of information to improve the Government's understanding of industry capabilities and existing and potential technologies in order to determine a realistic capability solution. It is the Government’s intent to form a Government-Industry Working Group to discuss the capabilities and potential performance specifications. All interested companies are invited to participate. This will provide industry a valuable opportunity for input, questions, and answers. Time is available for one-on-one exchanges between a contractor and the Government team during 14 through 18 June 2004, to discuss the contractor's thoughts on how the Working Group process should be implemented (white papers will be accepted), and address questions on potential capabilities, (contractor to provide in writing and softcopy in MSWORD 6.0). Any additional contractor briefings (to include capabilities briefings) will be limited to issues related to transformation of current Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) capability into a force protection system against both air and surface threats. Due to the limited time, the 1-on-1 meetings will be set up on a first-come-first-served basis. Participation is limited to 5 industry representatives per meeting. Other exchanges may take place at a later date. These meetings will take place at the Research Center at Quantico Marine Corps Base. To set up appointments for the one-on-one exchanges, please call Valerie Mosqueira at (703) 432-4192 or send email to Valerie Mosqueira at mosqueiravj@mcsc.usmc.mil with a copy to Jon Reznicek at reznicekJJ@mcsc.usmc.mil subject 1-on-1 exchanges, request should be received not later than 10 June 2004. Confirmation will be sent via e-mail and will include directions and points of contact for assistance. The meeting will be unclassified. No acquisition strategy will be discussed. Participation is totally voluntary, and the government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.

<SUBJECT>A -- Sources Sought for Diode-Pumped Liquid Oxygen High Energy Laser Research and Development
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FA8632-04-C-LTP1
<RESPDATE>060904
<ARCHDATE>08082004
<CONTACT>Dax Presuto, Contract Manager, Phone 505-846-0758, Fax 505-846-2931, Email dax.presuto@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), through their executing agent: Airborne Laser System Program Office, located at Kirtland Air Force Base, NM, is seeking to identify qualified private sector vendors capable of conducting research and development (R&D) on a diode-pumped liquid oxygen high energy (HEL) laser. The laser needs to operate in the eye-safe wavelength regime and use liquid air as the gain medium. The pulse length must be variable from continuous to sub-picosecond for use on various platforms. This is a joint effort between MDA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  The NAICS code for this effort is 541710 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Government intends to execute a research and development contract with Directed Energy Solutions who has worked on this technology under a previous DARPA contracted effort and anticipates that DES will be the only responsible source capable of successfully competing for a potential contract. As such, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source for the proposed effort under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302. The purpose of this synopsis consequently is to identify any other potential offerors. 

The Phase I success criteria established by DARPA are: 1) 4kW closed cavity laser design; 2) Cavity gain > 2%/cm (weapon goal: 5%/cm); 3) 200 MW/cm2 mirror survivability (or acceptable alternative approach); 4) Residual thermal and flow aberrations compensated to <0.008 waves/cm; 5) Scattering and waveguide absorptive and diffractive losses <10-4/cm; 6) M**2<1.3; 7) Specific power<40kg/kW for 2 seconds (weapon goal: <5kg/kW for 100 seconds); 8) System study showing potential for ~10X performance and/or O&M/logisitical improvement over COIL and solid state lasers; and 9) Specific user interest (identified near completion of Phase I if continuance onto Phase II is expected). In addition, the 4kW laser must be scalable. If all of these success criteria are met, there is a potential for the effort to proceed to a second Phase. Interested vendors should possess demonstrated experience in high-energy laser R&D and have a reasonable capacity to achieve the success criteria addressed above. 

REQUESTED INFORMATION: Interested and capable firms are asked to submit information (no more than 20 pages please) that provides the following: 1) Company information, to include a point of contact and address, type of company, size, security clearances, etc.; 2) description of experience in subject matter; and 3) description of the facilities and technical capabilities to perform diode-pumped liquid oxygen HEL R&D and capability to meet the Phase I success criteria given above. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses are due no later than 3:00 pm MDT, 09 Jun 04 and shall be electronically submitted to: Captain Dax Presuto at dax.presuto@kirtland.af.mil in an IBM PC-compatible program (.doc, .xls) or in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format. If you need to send a hard copy as well, please mail the package to: ASC/TMK, Attn: Capt Presuto, 1350 Wyoming Blvd SE, Bld 20200, Kirtland AFB, NM. 87117-5536.   NOTE: Foreign owned/foreign controlled firms and foreign nationals are advised they may be precluded from proposing due to potential access to militarily sensitive information and should contact Capt Presuto if you are a foreign firm.

DISCLAIMER: This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued, nor will the government pay for the information solicited in this sources sought announcement. In addition, the information provided will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

Solicitation No. 2004-Q-01301 is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  RFP 2004-Q-01301 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23. The associated NAICS code is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS), routinely performs a number of biochemical analyses on biological and environmental specimens to meet its goals.  These include generating national normative population data, collaborating with academic institutions and federal, state and local agencies in various public health-related investigations, and maintaining laboratory response readiness in support of CDC’s chemical terrorism response activities. The mass spectrometers, evaporators and supporting equipment used in many of these analyses must be operational at all times to provide this emergency response capability and to support long-term studies such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and the prospective epidemiologic studies of the National Centers for Child Health and Disease Prevention.
	
These instruments are highly complex with integrated computer operations and dedicated software, and their proper maintenance and repair requires a high degree of technical skills and long-term familiarity with the instruments. Because of CDC’s emergency response role in environmental studies and response to chemical terrorism events, it is critical that the downtime due to repairs is minimal.
	
The purpose of this project is to provide technical maintenance and service support for Thermo Finnigan laboratory instrumentation and supporting components (e.g. Agilent 6890 GCs connected to TF equipment) operated within the Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS).  The Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS / NCEH / CDC) is defined by Congress’ Federal Response Plan for Terrorism to be the single location for measuring chemical warfare agents or their metabolites in humans.  The Division of Laboratory Sciences’ primary other responsibility through its second Congressional appropriations line, is to provide measurements of environmental toxicants in humans, or "biomonitoring."  This support should optimize instrument performance and minimize instrument downtime due to repairs.
	
This project will involve both software and hardware support, and only the manufacturer has the expertise of supporting both the hardware and the interfacing/controlling software. In some cases, proper support of the software may require access to proprietary source code, which is only available through the manufacturer.  Instruments covered under this proposed contract include new components with proprietary construction.  To the best of our knowledge, only Thermo Finnigan, LLC, 355 River Oaks Parkway, San Jose CA, is the only firm capable of providing preventive maintenance and timely repair of highly specialized analytical instrument systems, all of which are manufactured and distributed by Thermo Finnigan.  However, any interested party who believes to have the capability for the required preventive maintenance and replacement of parts that are completely compatible with pre-existing Thermo Finnigan equipment as required by this RFP may submit prices for each of the equipment listed in the spreadsheet provided as an attachment.

I.  Scope oF Work:  The Contractor shall perform preventive maintenance and repair services for the Government-owned Thermo Finnigan equipment listed in the Schedule of Items.  The Contractor shall furnish all material, labor (including travel), tools, parts and shipment of parts, supplies, and equipment (excluding instrument expendables) at no additional cost to the Government.  Offerors shall propose a fund of approximately 5 percent of the total contract value per period of performance for expendable parts that can be charged to provide expedited order and delivery of consumable parts.

II.  Tasks to be Performed:  Two preventive maintenance visits are required per year for each instrument system.  Each preventive maintenance visit shall consist of instrumentation cleaning, optimization, and a diagnostic examination and replacement of any parts (including expendables) which show significant signs of wear or signs of imminent failure.  Instrument performance shall meet or exceed the minimum specifications detailed in the manufacturer’s instrument operator manual.  

Expendables for other than preventive maintenance will be furnished and installed by the Government as needed. The installation of such parts and/or supplies will be affected at no additional charge during the course of a normal servicing visit, if need for their installation or replacement becomes evident upon inspection.  

Contractor shall provide a 24-hour response for repair requests on Thermo Finnigan and auxiliary equipment.  Repair services will be available at the request of CDC laboratory personnel, and will cover instrument failures that occur through normal use.  Service calls shall be performed during the Government’s working days and hours only, on an unlimited basis during the contract period. The normal Government work days and hours Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  Telephone response shall be within 2 hours of notification for a service call made within the hours of 7:00 AM and 2:30 PM and by 9:00 AM of the following business day for calls made after 2:30 PM.  Service response must take place within 24 hours of the initial telephone call from CDC personnel.  Response shall be in one of the following forms: (1) a telephone call troubleshooting the problem and resulting in repair of the equipment by CDC personnel; (2) a dispatch of part(s) for problem resolution with instructions for replacement/repair by CDC personnel; or (3) an on-site visit by a service representative, depending upon the nature of the problem as requested by CDC personnel. No weekend service, or service on Government holidays shall be required.  Contractor shall provide a minimum of 8 days of on-site training in general operation, software, and/or application-specific optimization of the instrumental parameters.

III.  Government Furnished Property:  The Government is responsible for providing consumable parts, operating supplies, and other items which by their nature or intended use have a prescribed life, such as injection port liners, columns, filaments, multipliers, and other parts similarly referenced in the applicable manufacturer’s operating manuals.  The Government can obtain these parts through a normal purchasing request or by charging the cost of the item(s) against the expendable parts money included in the contract.

IV.  Availability for Servicing:  The Government shall make equipment available at the time of each scheduled maintenance or emergency service call. The Contractor’s representative shall contact the Project Officer or Alternative Project Officer, 24 hours in advance to arrange for a mutually agreeable date and time for each preventive maintenance call.

V.  Location of equipment:  All items of equipment are located in the Division of Laboratory Sciences laboratories of building 17 and building 103, 4770 Buford Hwy NE, Atlanta, GA 30341-3724. 

VI. Period of Performance:  There is a base period of 3 months from date of contract award, four option periods of 12 months, and one option period of 9 months.  The total base and option periods shall not exceed 60 months.

The following FAR clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition: 
52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jan 2004), and 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (May 2004), apply to this RFP. The following FAR clauses apply:
52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial items (Jan 1999): The following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance, applies: (a) Preventive Maintenance Experience; (b) Product Compatibility; (c) Past performance; and (d) Price. (Price is an important factor for award.  However, the non-price factors listed above, when combined, are more important than price.  CDC reserves the right to award the contract to an offeror who may not be the lowest in price.)  CDC will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  CDC may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options will not obligate CDC to exercise the option(s). Award of a firm-fixed price contract will be made to a single offeror whose quote, conforming to this RFQ, will be most advantageous to the CDC, price and other factors considered.  Award may be made without discussions/negotiations.  Offerors are advised to submit their initial quotes in the best favorable terms to the government. 
52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Oct 2003) (with addendum incorporating 52.247-35F.O.B. Destination, Within Consignee’s Premises (Apr 1984),  and 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000).
52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (May 2004).

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. N68711-04-D-3609, TREE TRIMMING AND REMOVAL SERVICES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN POINT LOMA AND SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be a single award contract.  This solicitation is 100% set aside for Small Businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561730 and the size standard is $6 million dollars.  The solicitation document, incorporated provisions, and clauses are those in effect through FAR Circular 01-23.  This solicitation incorporates FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212.3, 52.212.4, and 52.212-5, and are attached to the solicitation.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: FACTOR 1: KEY PERSONNEL, Offerors will be evaluated based on demonstrated knowledge and experience of their proposed Arborist.  For each Arborist, offerors should identify the Arborist by name and provide information demonstrating whether and/or to what extent the proposed Arborist is an American citizen knowledgeable of, and experienced in the profession of Arboriculture who, through experience, education, and related training, possesses the competence to provide for or supervise the management of trees and other woody plants.  For each proposed Arborist, offerors should provide copies of any certifications received from the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA).  
FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE, Provide a list of up to 10 contracts the offeror completed during the past three years preceding the initial closing date of the RFP, and a list of all contracts currently being performed by the offeror, that are similar in size and complexity to the solicited contract.  Contracts listed may include those the contractor entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, or commercial customers.  Use the enclosed Attachment #3 to provide requested relevant information for each contract listed.  Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective.  The evaluation of past performance will include the contractor’s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, record of conforming to applicable law and industry standards (i.e., Service Contract Act Wage Determinations/Industry Standards A300 and Industry Safety Standards Z133, etc.); quality of workmanship, record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies; record of controlling costs; safety performance record, and adherence to schedules.  The Government reserves the right to contact any other sources of information that may have knowledge or information on an offeror’s relevant past performance history.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to proposals of other offerors.
FACTOR 3: PRICE, The price proposal for the base and all option periods will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the offeror’s proposal.  One or more of the following techniques will be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price: 
1.	Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.
2.	Comparison of proposed prices with the independent Government estimate.
3.	Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information.
4.	Comparison of proposed prices with resources proposed. 
A price that is found to be unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable.  
Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: Key personnel, past performance and price are of approximately equal importance.  Key personnel and past performance, when combined, are approximately of equal importance as price.
Offers are due on Tuesday, 15 June 2004 by 2:30 P.M. local time and shall be delivered to NFEC Southwest Division, Attn: Michelle Crook, Code 02R3.MEC, 1220 Pacific Highway, Bldg 127, San Diego, CA 92132.  Point of Contact for this solicitation is Michelle Crook, telephone (619) 532-1949.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 001.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer contractor questions.  The date for submission of proposals is not extended.  QUESTION 1. The solicitation says that USASOC would like the contractor to provide pistols and holsters for each student.  Will USASOC want to use any rifles for this training, such as the M4 that soldiers currently carry? It is our belief that students should use and train with the very weapons they are issued and carry on a daily basis. We will offer firearms training but feel strongly that students bring their own weapons. Is this a problem?  ANSWER: The contractor shall provide weapons and holsters.  No rifles are required for the training. The advanced marksmanship training refers to the break contact drills, i.e..  firing from behind cover (vehicles), at stationary targets with pistols, and firing through windshield and windows to teach the students the effect on accuracy and overpressure. The intent of this training is to teach the student the principles and techniques. The students can apply what they learn to other weapons. The same idea applies to vehicles. The students may learn the principle on an SUV but later apply the same techniques to a sedan or even a HMMWV.  QUESTION 2.  The solicitation says that the Government shall be providing the Hmmwv's.  Do we have a choice of particular Hmmwv they will ship?  ANSWER: The Government will provide two M998 HMMWVs.  QUESTION 3.  Specifically mentioned that the government will provide NVG's, yet doesn't specify if they wanted students to get training with driving under NVG, is this a particular POI?  ANSWER:  The NVGs should be used during the basic and intermediate off road driving portion. Actual amount of night driving will be determined by the vendors training schedule.  QUESTION 4.  Is this solicitation like others that I've done in the past, where the contractor doesn't receive any payment until all training is completed. This asks the contractor to feed and house the students (48) for the duration of the training. That's quite a chunk. Is there any way the rewarded contractor could be paid weekly?  ANSWER:  There is no possibility of weekly payments however, the contractor may invoice upon completion of each iteration.  QUESTION 5. If the students are going to bring their own weapons, can they ship military ammo with the Hummvees?  ANSWER:  Per Section D.  RECOMMENDED CONTRACTOR FURNISHED EQUIPMENT, the contractor shall provide ammunition.  QUESTION 6. If the final filling date is the 28th of May, how soon will the winning contractor be notified?  ANSWER: It is my intent to award within a few days of receipt of proposals.  QUESTION 7.  How soon after that can training begin? Is the finish date of 9 July set in stone  ANSWER:  The Government will be able to send students 10 - 14 days after date of award.  The latest possible date training can be completed is 13 July 04.

5 Project Descriptions and Profile

In December 2003, USTDA provided funding of $540,015 grant for a feasibility study to assist Kazaeronavigatsiya, the agency in charge of air traffic control in Kazakhstan, with a study on modernizing the Central Asian regional CNS/ATM systems.   Kazeronavigatsiya, acting on behalf of all the participating countries, is relatively inexperienced with administering a competitive selection, particularly among U.S. firms, and it is therefore necessary to provide technical assistance in undertaking this process.  Because this is a regional project, it is important that the process is transparent.  The RFP for the project is attached as an annex to this solicitation to provide further background.

<DESC>The following technical questions were submitted. The following government responses are also provided. QUESTION Would ground transportation of helicopters and spare tail boom assembly to facility be an acceptable method because this would be the sam e cost as flight operations. RESPONSE No. The solicitation states THE 5 EACH UH-1H HELICOPTERS AND 1 EACH SPARE TAIL BOOM ASSEMBLY WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE FACILITY OF THE SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR. SINCE FLIGHT OPERATIONS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE THE FACILITY OF THE SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR CANNOT BE LOCATED MORE THAN 3 FLIGHT HOURS FROM THE U.S. ARMY YUMA PROVING GROUND (YPG), AZ.  THIS LIMITS POTENTIAL OFFERORS TO THE ARIZONA GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF KINGMAN, PHOENIX, TUCSON, AND LOCATIONS THAT ARE WITHIN THE 3 HOUR FLIGHT RADIUS FROM YPG. THIS LIMITS POTENTIAL OFFERORS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF SAN DIEGO AND LOCATIONS THAT ARE WITHIN THE 3 HOUR FLIGHT RADIUS FROM YPG. Ground transportation has the inherent risk of conflicts as to airworthiness of the a ircraft and the loss of man days required for this evolution. QUESTION What are the weight and balance procedures. RESPONSE AR 95-71, Chapter 7 provides regulatory guidance for a weight and balance control system for operation of Army aircraft.  To review AR 95-71 go to web site http://www.usapa.army.mil/ in the left hand column click on Text Version.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.
