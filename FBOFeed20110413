<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is issuing a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOIs) to U.S. Small Businesses for the SunShot Incubator Program. The Department of Energy&lsquo;s (DOE) SunShot Initiative aims to significantly reduce solar energy costs by 75% before the end of the decade, making solar energy cost-competitive with conventional forms of electricity without subsidies and enabling widespread deployment of solar energy. The SunShot Incubator Program is an expansion of DOE's successful Photovoltaic (PV) Technology Incubator Program that will allow for accelerated investment in a broader base of transformational technologies that will dramatically drive down the cost of solar energy as a part of the SunShot Initiative. Given the new SunShot Initiative goals, the current program has now expanded to include concentrating solar power (CSP), power electronics, and balance of systems (BOS) innovations. The SunShot Incubator Program represents a significant component of the DOE business strategy of partnering with U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV, CSP, and BOS research and development (R&amp;D) and validation to meet aggressive installed cost and market penetration goals. This rigorous program specifically aims to provide early-stage assistance to help cutting edge technologies overcome technological and market barriers and achieve commercialization in the United States. This specific partnership leverages technical capabilities and resources within the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and other DOE laboratories/facilities to enhance and support areas of expertise within a small business in order to accelerate the development of the Responder's technology toward full-scale manufacturing in the United States. The Solicitation for LOIs will be released shortly and shall be available to view/download from NREL's website at http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Picatinny, Picatinny NJ on behalf of Benet Laboratories intends to award a sole source contract with Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp., Summit Office Park, West Building, 300 Centerville Road, Suite 209W, Warwick, RI 02886-0201.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 511210 and the small business size standard in dollars is $25 million.
The Government has a need to purchase a suite of ABAQUS software applications that will meet Benet Laboratories engineering requirements for finite element analysis and computer aided engineering requirements for analyzing and modeling large caliber cannon.  This application of a standard set of pre- and post-processing application tools for each analysis engine allows a cross-collaboration between engineers and designers using a common set of software application tools.  The following is an itemized list of the Abacus software application configurations needed to support this objective:  55 Analysis Tokens consisting of Abaqus/Foundation, Abaqus/AMS, parallel execution, Co-simulation Engine, Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian Analysis  annual lease;  10 Abaqus/CAE Seats  annual lease;  1 Pro/Engineer Associative Interface  annual lease; 1 fe-safe  annual lease.  This proposed contract action requires Dassault to supply ABAQUS software applications so that substantial duplication costs are not incurred by the Government.  
AUTHORITY: This acquisition is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Responsible offerors may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government; but this notice of intent, is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 28 April 2011Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 29 April 2011. The point of contact for this requirement is Lauren McDermott, ACC-PICA-JA, Bldg. 40, Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet NY 12189-4000.  Email: lauren.a.mcdermott@us.army.mil.
APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp. since Dassault is the only vendor that sells and distributes Abaqus Licensing. Within the past 10 years Dassault Systems Simulia Corp. alone was responsible for all of Benet Laboratories Abaqus software support.  This sole source position is predicated on Dassault Systems Simulia Corporation being the only manufacture, developer and provider of Abaqus software and software support.  Abaqus is an essential tool for the scientists and engineers at Benet Laboratories.

<DESC>The Contractor will perform vascular access procedures to repair failed fistulas or grafts with the goal of restoring patency in dialysis patients on an outpatient basis who are referred through Nephrology Section, VA NYHHS.  An arteriovenous (AV) fistula or graft is a conduit between an artery and a vein that may be surgically created to facilitate dialysis.  Due to infection or other factors, a fistula or graft may become occluded, partially or totally, or clotted, compromising dialysis.  Treatment of the fistula or graft by open surgical repair, reconstruction or replacement or insertion of a catheter for temporary access exposes the patient to risks associated with surgery, hospitalization, infection, and other negative impacts.  These may be avoided by means of nonsurgical interventional vascular access procedures to maintain or restore access patency, which can be performed on an outpatient basis.   Capacity to perform these procedures at VA NYHHS is limited.  Due to the need to maintain dialysis schedules and avoid surgery and other complications that arise when dialysis access is lost or occluded, it is sometimes impossible or inadvisable to schedule patients to be treated at VA NYHHS within the time frames required for patient care needs.  A contract is needed to make these services available for dialysis patients when other options cannot be used.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED)<br />The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) <br />Office of Migrant Education (OME) <br />Migrant Education Program (MEP)
<p>Full and Open Competition (Both small and large businesses are welcome to submit proposals)</p>
<p>It is determined that these services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.101. Based on the results of market research, it is determined that commercial sources are available and capable of satisfying this requirement.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about April 21, 2011. OME is mandated in the No Child Left Behind Act in Section 1308(b) to assist the States in developing effective methods for the electronic transfer of student records and in determining the number of migratory children in each State. OME established the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) project to accomplish this mandate. The MSIX was implemented in September 2007 and currently supports migrant records for 97% of the migrant student population with 41 states having submitted data for inclusion in MSIX.</p>
<p>The support will include System Operations, Customer Support, Help Desk &amp; Trouble Ticket Management, Asset Management, and State Support for the MSIX. In meeting the goals and objectives of this requirement, the support shall also include:<br />a. Ensure that MSIX remains fully functional and stable (e.g. bug-fixes, security upgrades, software patches), and complete all required system, hardware and software upgrades in a timely manner. Note: all upgrades or enhancements shall be coordinated with ED.<br />b. Interface daily with customers and other MSIX personnel to maintain a high quality of support for MSIX. Responsibilities shall include system usage training for the customers, and rapid response to all technical problems reported to the Contractor by the customers or by MSIX staff.<br />c. Be expected to install and maintain all MSIX hardware components and keep track of them via an automated reporting and tracking tool (Note: The contractor should include the tracking tool in the proposal and describe its features and functionality.) <br />d. Perform Help Desk Support &amp; Trouble Ticket Management tasks required to meet expected service levels and to support the end users of the MSIX. <br />e. Meet related system security requirements.<br />f. Support ED initiated MSIX staff training initiatives.</p>
<p>Overarching Objectives and Tasks</p>
<p>The objective of the MSIX is to provide a successful electronic system for linking existing State migrant student record systems and electronically exchanging timely and relevant migrant student records to benefit migrant students nationwide. The ability to exchange migrant student records efficiently facilitates the timely enrollment and placement of migrant students by providing better access to basic school enrollment information. An efficient records exchange system benefits highly mobile secondary migrant students by providing and maintaining course credit accrual information necessary for high school graduation.</p>
<p>The following overarching objectives are mandated to be accomplished under this contract.<br />a. Obtain under a performance-based arrangement, highly reliable and secure IT managed services and support that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations.<br />b. Establish a partner-focused working relationship with Government.<br />c. Establish appropriate and effective incentives that fundamentally align the goals and objectives of the Contractor and Government to ensure superior services are provided.<br />d. Throughout the life of this effort, demonstrate improved performance, reliability, security, and reduced cost of operating MSIX.<br />e. Given the dynamics of the information technology environment, establish a task order arrangement that easily accommodates change (i.e. implement new and innovative technologies).<br />f. Develop and implement operation and maintenance services that support the Department of Education's compliance with Government standards and requirements (e.g., all Federal Government directives and standards related to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, also known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA), the Computer Security Act of 1987, OMB Circulars A-130 and A-123.<br />g. Provide a partnership with team members and/or subcontractors that appears seamless to the Government and that fosters shared accountability and responsibility among all partners. Ideally, subcontracts will also be performance-based.<br />h. Provide timely services to enable OME and MSIX to meet its mission critical requirements with potentially short down times.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is one 12-month base year with four 12-month option years.</p>

<p>SRCL formula grants were awarded to 46 State Educational Agencies (SEAs) to establish and support a State Literacy Team with expertise in literacy development and education for children from birth to grade 12 to assist the State in developing a comprehensive literacy plan. Formula grants to States depended upon their share of funds under Title I Part A, with no State having received less than $150,000.</p>
<p>SRCL discretionary grants will be awarded competitively to approximately 3-18 State Educational Agencies (SEAs) that must subgrant at least 95 percent of the funds to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) and early childhood providers. Entities eligible for SRCL discretionary subgrants are LEAs or other nonprofit providers of early childhood education that partner with a public or private nonprofit organization or agency with a demonstrated record of effectiveness in improving the early literacy development of children from birth through kindergarten entry and in providing professional development in early literacy. States must give priority to agencies and entities serving greater numbers or percentages of disadvantaged children. LEAs will use these funds for services and activities that have characteristics of effective literacy instruction through professional development, screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level, and other research based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice for all students. SEA grantees must ensure that: 15% of subgranted funds shall be used to serve children from birth through age 5; 40% of subgranted funds shall be used to serve children in kindergarten through grade 5; and 40% of subgranted funds shall be used to serve students in middle and high school including an equitable distribution of funds between middle and high schools.</p>
<p>The scope of this contract will encompass planning and implementation activities related to SRCL grants. The scope of work for this contract includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide logistical support for all grantee meetings <br />&bull; Plan and support Webinars<br />&bull; Provide technical assistance to discretionary grantees<br />&bull; Provide technical assistance to State Literacy Teams<br />&bull; Provide consultative assistance to States and districts <br />&bull; Propose expert speakers for conferences and meetings<br />&bull; Identify and disseminate resource materials<br />&bull; Create Monthly News Bulletin <br />&bull; Administer all tasks in the contract <br />&bull; Create and implement a plan for professional development<br />&bull; Submit expenditure/progress reports<br />&bull; Collect and analyze GPRA/APR data<br />&bull; Conduct an analysis of data collected and submitted through annual reports and other data sources</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is one 12-month base year with three 12-month option years.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of Research Support Services, intends to negotiate with THOMSON REUTERS (SCIENTIFIC), INC, 1500 SPRING GARDEN ST # 4, PHILADELPHIA, PA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b), renewal to Inspec database for access to journals, books, reports, and conference proceedings from 1969 to present.
<p>Inspec provides data from more than 4,500 scientific and technical journals, as well as books, reports, and 2,200 conference proceedings. Inspec is the only sci/tech database that indexes the papers in conference proceedings, a valuable source of technical information. Inspec provides a comprehensive index to the literature in physics, electrical/electronic engineering, computing, control engineering and information technology, with significant global coverage in areas such as materials science, oceanography, nuclear engineering, geophysics, biomedical engineering and biophysics. It delivers more than 10 million bibliographic records from publications worldwide, including over 3,700 scientific and technical journals, plus books, reports and 2,000 conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Although Inspec can be purchased directly from Institution of Engineering and Technology, the publisher of the database, NIST Research Library requests that Inspec be purchased through Thomson Reuters because it can be fully integrated with Thomson Reuters' 151 Web of Knowledge (151 WOK) content and capabilities. The NIST Research Library has purchased access to the Web of Knowledge for many years and is the most heavily used NIST Research Library database with over 150,000 searches conducted each year by NIST Research Scientists. Accessing Inspec on the 151 WOK platform means that the NIST researchers can simultaneously search the 151 WOK resources that NIST is currently subscribing to.</p>
<p>NIST Scientists can find complementary information in resources such as Web of Science&reg;, to which NIST subscribes, while taking advantage of powerful tools such as cited reference searching. One common vocabulary and search strategy within this platform enables search terms to be matched to all relevant terms that may be categorized differently in other databases, delivering more comprehensive and relevant results.</p>
<p>No other vendor offers the platform required to meet NIST's needs.</p>
<p>Interested parties that are authorized by THOMSON REUTERS (SCIENTIFIC), INC, Renewal of Membership, to sell the aforementioned Services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before April 25, 2010 by 2 PM EST. Such written responses will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511140, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 2:00 p.m. (Eastern) on April 25, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Willie.Lu@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

The Government intends to procure Rifle Barrel Coating on a full-and-open competition basis by awarding to the responsible Offeror whose offer presents the best value to the Government considering technical, past performance, and price related factors.
  This is a non-commercial competitive procurement under the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program and its focus on Barrel coatings to extend rifle barrel life. Procurement will be in accordance with the FCT program.  It is anticipated that this procurement will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) three-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.

This effort will procure the application of a Barrel Coating to extend rifle barrel life and include a visual wear indicator.  The treated barrels shall be used in support of precision and automatic weapons requirements for the Department of Defense on the MK13 and MK15 Sniper Rifle Systems and the M2HB .50cal Machine Gun.
  The goal is to provide the most precise, durable, reliable, and effective barrels possible by reducing down time of the weapons for barrel replacement and therefore reducing overall O&M costs.  The Government contemplates providing a quantity of barrels as GFM to the awardee in order to accomplish the preproduction portion of this procurement effort.  Upon the successful completion of preproduction units, the Government may then choose to procure production quantities as required.

The anticipated contract minimum value is $25,000.00.  The potential maximum contract value is $2,000,000.00.  All items shall be produced in accordance with the associated Statement of Work and CDRLs attached to the forthcoming solicitation.
  The delivery requirements will be negotiated through discussions prior to contract award.  Delivery requirements shall be F.O.B. Destination; inspection and acceptance occur at the destination.

The solicitation attachments will be posted to the FBO website concurrently with the solicitation.  The Offeror must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive the solicitation attachments.  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the internet at www.ccr.gov.  In accordance with FAR 4.1201, the Offeror shall also complete electronic annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the CCR database.

All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date of the solicitation will be posted to the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO as amendments issued to the solicitation.
  For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that submitted a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed; interested sources must download the document from the websites names above.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.

<a href="mailto:Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov">Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research & Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), has a requirement titled ?X-Ray Photoelectric Spectroscopy (XPS)?. This requirement involves XPS which is a quantitative spectroscopic surface chemical analysis technique used to estimate the empirical formula or elemental composition, chemical state and electronic state of the elements on the surface (up to 10 nm) of a material.  This technique provides a quantitative analysis of the surface composition and is sometimes known by the alternate acronym, ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis) and can reveal the oxidation state of the trace metal in molecules on the surface of particles.
XPS analysis will be used to determine the abundance and speciation of trace metals and metalloids adsorbed or sequestered on natural and synthetic materials ranging from sediments and soils to drinking water distribution system scale materials, laboratory prepared metal oxides, and organic polymers. Depth profiling employing XPS analysis will also be used to evaluate contaminants deposited on soil and sediment material. XPS analysis of nanomaterials will provide increased information regarding how particle size influences the electronic properties, and consequently the chemical properties, of nanomaterials compared with bulk materials. Data obtained from the detailed analysis of nanoparticles will be incorporated into existing bioavailability protocols and environmental risk models to provide more accurate predictions regarding fate and transport and ultimately potential impacts on ecological and human health.
The EPA is seeking a contractor to provide the XPS with all components and specifications listed in the Specifications section which will be identified in the solicitation.  The successful offeror shall deliver and install the instrument and components. The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price (FFP) purchase order with a maximum delivery date from six (6) months of award.  The anticipated solicitation release date is early May 2011 and the close date shall be approximately 15 days thereafter. The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis with no small business set-aside(s).
Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFQ. All responsible sources may submit a response for EPA consideration. The NAICS code is 334516, (Analytical Lab Instrument Manufacturing) with a size standard of 500 persons. Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The point of contact is Nicole Modafari, Contract Specialist, at 513-487-2001, Modafari.Nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Server must be running RHEL 5 and not RHEL 6 because of the compatibility and legacy systems that run off the Server. We need one new Red Hat Linux server which will consolidate all of these servers. The server must have inexpensive storage with a variety of storage speeds and capacities, and a tape library for disaster recovery backups. *Please see the attachment for further information*
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USGS requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency (FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii)). All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Zachary Buss, at zbuss@usgs.gov.

<a href="mailto:melissa.k.koehn@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Design Build Contract, a long-term remedy for the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans area.  The purpose of the project is to provide storm surge risk reduction for the areas near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals from the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge, while not impeding the ability of the areas internal drainage system to function.  This includes design and construction of independent permanent gated storm surge barriers and pump stations at the discharge end of each canal.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacities of the three canals are: 17th Street, 12,500 cubic feet per second (cfs); Orleans Avenue, 2,700 cfs and London Avenue, 9,000 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234.  The existing Interim Closure Structures shall remain operational during the construction phase of the new pump stations.  The most technically effective means of accomplishing the dual purpose of storm surge risk reduction and simultaneous evacuation of storm water should be given highest consideration by offerors.  The contract will require a performance bond and payment bond for the design and construction effort, but the pumps, pump drivers, and generators may not necessarily be included in the bonding requirements.  The equipment may be procured under separate supply line items in the design-build contract.  Offerors may choose to take advantage of this arrangement by omitting the equipment from their bonds, but are not obligated to do so.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 237990 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $33.5 M.  An acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required for award.  It is anticipated that the RFP - Phase I (Request for Proposal  RFP I) will be issued April 2010, with the issuance of a Draft RFP  Phase II to the short-listed firms in the 2nd  Quarter of CY2010.  The estimated range of construction is over $500 million. However, this Design-Build project will have a build to budget amount.  The Government's intent is to maximize the best value obtainable for that ceiling amount.  In selecting the winning offer in Phase II, technical non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost/price.  However, the contract award for design and construction shall not exceed the ceiling amount.  The selection process will be structured such that offers that optimize technical/management solutions within the contract budget amount will be viewed more favorably than offers that attempt to trade off performance in favor of lower prices.  APPROACH and SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem, the Government intends to procure Design - Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers, Two  Phase Design-Build Selection Procedure (FAR Part 36.3).  In Phase I, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal Phase I and from those respondents, select, based on Past Performance and Technical Approach a short list of three (3) to five (5) firms.  After selection of the short-listed firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP - Phase II, the Government may engage in exchanges of information with the short-listed firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  For example, the Government will issue a draft RFP to the short-listed firms and request their feedback. In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  The Government will then issue RFP - Phase II and from that, select a single technical approach based on the Best Value Continuum Selection Method using the Tradeoff process.  To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the short-listed firms, along with design criteria.  The task of selecting the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the offerors.  It remains the responsibility of the offeror to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach.  Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3 for both phases of the RFP.  The evaluation criteria for Phase I, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Experience; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Approach.  The factors are listed above are all approximately equal in importance.  The evaluation criteria for Phase II, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Management Capability; and (3) Socio Economic Utilization.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD VOSB), HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.  The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR SubPart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting goals for this District are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be places with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBZone SB; (5) 3.5 for VOSB; and (6) at least 2.0% for SD VOSB.  SHARING OF KEY TECHNICAL DATA: The Government intends to provide a stipend in the amount of $500,000 to the Phase II unsuccessful offerors.  Offerors must make it to Phase II in order to be considered for stipend.

<DESC>REPLACE 5TH FLOOR AHU AND ASSCOCIATED DUCTS
               PROJECT NUMBER 575-11-105


   This project is a design build construction contract.  The contract will require a professional service to survey the occupancy of the 5th floor, Building 1 and design a variable air volume system with electronic controls. Design is expected to meet energy efficiency standards as set by trade authorities and the Federal Government.  The air handler unit will utilize the existing connections for steam and chilled water.    Construction will remove the existing system and install the new system. Construction will also require the removal of asbestos board surrounding the interior surfaces of the radiator wells throughout the 5th floor along with removal of the perimeter steam heating radiators.  Infection control procedures will be an integral part of the design.  Coordination with all on-site VA constructions projects are expected by this contract.
 

Constructed in 1980, the existing system is dual duct, high velocity, and constant volume system.  The AHU and ductwork serves approximately 15000 square feet of patient care area. The existing air handling unit is located on the roof structure of the 6th floor with supply and return air duct work penetrating the interstitial space between the 6th and 7th (penthouse) floors.  The area is currently occupied by Intensive Care, Mental Hygiene and Post Anesthetic Care Unit.  Because of this occupancy, the design/build contractor will be required to provide a work schedule that will minimize impact on those services.  
  
The design and construction of this project is anticipated to involve 270 days.  During the construction period, the contractor is expected to provide safety barriers and other means to ensure the safety of patients, visitors and staff.


The C & A requirements do NOT apply to this project.
									
The design and build shall utilize the VA Master Specifications and Design Manuals/Guides as found at www.cfm.va.gov/til/spec.asp.  Other codes and standards are current editions of ASHRAE, NEC, ANSI, NFPA, OSHA and IBC.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis<br />T-38C Avionics Sustainment
<p>1. The Government intends to award a sole source, 90 day contract (with an option for 90 additional days) to provide a bridge between the current Avionics Upgrade Program contract and the follow-on Avionics Post Production Support contract outlined in RFIFA8211-11-R-3000, which will be awarded under full and open competition. This contract is expected to be awarded in March 2012, and only if required for coverage until the APPS competitive award is made. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to conduct market research and to determine if any other firm has the capability to accomplish a Contract Logistic Support (CLS) Field Service Representatives (FSR) and Contractor Operated Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) support and sustainment for the T38C fleet Avionics System seamlessly without ramp-up/ramp-down time. They must be able to be fully operational with 30 days or less notice after award. Failure to meet required performance metrics for this bridge contract is unacceptable. Further, time doesn't permit the ramp up ramp down period that a transition would normally require. The following effort would be required on contract start date: <br />&bull; Establishment and operation of a COMBS facility to include part stock, store, and issue in support of the organizational maintenance functions at specified locations <br />&bull; Establish an operational off-base component repair program under CLS<br />&bull; Procure, maintain and utilize an inventory database to include maintenance data collection, contractor-furnished support equipment, and calibration and maintenance activity<br />&bull; Determine and provide range and depth of spares required to meet operational requirements at 5 COMBS (Columbus AFB, Laughlin AFB, Randolph AFB, Sheppard AFB, Vance AFB) and Holloman AFB, Edwards AFB, and Patuxent NAS.<br />&bull; Develop and implement operational procedures for receiving, storing and issuing avionics components throughout the life of the contract<br />&bull; Maintain an interface with each commander at each Main Operating Base (MOB)<br />&bull; Maintain all communication requirements (attend meetings; provide metrics, status, etc.)<br />&bull; Maintain current HAZMAT handling, storage, management and disposal plan that complies with federal, state and local military base procedures, rules, regulations and requirements<br />&bull; Perform program business, contract administration, financial controls, and ILS management functions to maintain ongoing business and contractual support of the program<br />&bull; Provide for on-site FSR at 5 COMBS locations, Edward's AFB, and Patuxent NAS, and FSR phone support to Holloman AFB as required by Government to provide continuing proficiency training to the organizational maintenance contractor's personnel, technical support and investigation of unusual or reoccurring problems, and change recommendations to procedures or equipment<br />&bull; Provide procedures for approval by the Government that address work requests to repair/replace parts resulting from damage<br />&bull; Provide a damaged equipment proposal that details all repair or replacement of all over and above damaged equipment items that the contractor and government verified as having been damaged during the period of performance<br />&bull; Contractor is expected to maintain: <br />&bull; 40 hours Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) on a six month moving average for the fleet<br />&bull; The COMBS must provide a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) replacement within 30 minutes of request 95% of the time<br />&bull; The contractor shall maintain an Avionics Mission Success Rate (AMSR) of 98%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND: Beginning in 1996, as part of the T-38 Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP), the Government awarded two initial contracts on a competitive basis. Contract F33657-95-C-0057 was the development contract. The Government later awarded F41608-96-D-0700 in 1999 after completion of Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) testing. Contract F33657-95-C-0057 expired in 2004 and was replaced with sole source contract FA8617-04-C-6153 to conclude production and installation of the modification kits and provide sustaining engineering. The government is currently in the process of combining the CLS and Engineering support into one contract that will be awarded with full and open competition. The purpose of this sole source bridge contract is to provide CLS and COMBs support during the interim.</p>
<p><br />3. INFORMATION/FORMAT: Interested and capable contractors should submit&nbsp;their reponse regarding this bridge effort, and should include the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Company name and associated CAGE code<br />&bull; Point of contact name and number<br />&bull; Business status (8(a),Large, Small, HUBZone, Woman-owned, etc.)<br />&bull; Transition plan that provides milestones demonstrating the Contractor's capability to begin work with 30 day or less notification of work commencement. Please provide contract numbers and PCO for similar efforts that have been implemented in 30 days or less.</p>
<p><br />4. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS: Please submit your comments to the Sources Sought Synopsis in an executive summary format not to exceed five (5) pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information. <br /><br />Comments should be submitted via e-mail to the following:<br />marilee.barnes@hill.af.mil and edward.waghorn@hill.af.mil no later than 5:00 pm Mountain Standard Time (MST) on Friday, 29 April, 2011.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - Third Party Logistics (3PL) for  Global Pharmaceutical Supply and Shipment

<ARCHDATE>05312011
<CONTACT>Raymond W Bouford, Director, RPSO, Phone 49-69-7535-3304, Fax 49-69-7535-3329, Email boufordrw@state.gov
<DESC>This request is for market research and informational purposes only.
<p>The Department of State (DOS), Office of Acquisition Management, on behalf of the Office of Logistics Operations, and the Office of Medical Services, desires to establish a Third Party Logistics (3PL) logistical support contract to provide global pharmaceutical and medical supply support services to over 200 U.S. Embassies and Consulates (also referred to in this document as "posts") around the world. The contractor would ideally provide end to end support from order placement by the post to receipt by post.</p>
<p>This RFI describes the Government's basic requirement, and requests input on how the pharmaceutical/medical supply industry may provide better support than we have been able to achieve in house. The Department of State solicits comments which address: the feasibility of such a contract, the extent to which industry can meet the Government's requirements, the suggested contract type and line item structure, the acquisition approach, strategies for implementation, potential problems, program management, pricing strategies, potential costs, process maps, etc. Perhaps you have great examples of how you support civilian industry or Non-Governmental Organizations overseas.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. If any information is proprietary please mark it as such but we would like as much information as possible to be usable in a request for proposal to be issued to the public.</p>
<p>Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible in providing suggestions for alternative approaches and solutions. Feedback of a general or non-specific nature is less useful and will have limited utility in refining the acquisition strategy and the content of any future Request for Proposal (RFP). Interested parties may respond to this RFI in accordance with the instructions provided elsewhere in this package.</p>
<p>The scope is that we procure about $3M in various pharmaceuticals each year that have to be shipped to about 267 posts around the world all with their own customs requirements, some very onerous. We have provided the list of the top 400 used products but require industry to provide any item we require or a interchangeable product acceptable to the medical professionals at post.</p>
<p>Services required to be provided include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Receiving orders for pharmaceuticals and other medical products from post customers electronically; <br />&bull; Possible electronic data interface with Department of State procurement systems. <br />&bull; Establishing and maintaining a 24-hour/7 day per week customer order support service;<br />&bull; Purchasing the required items at best possible prices; <br />&bull; Receipt, storage, warehousing, and inventory management of those products prior to shipment; <br />&bull; Packaging and shipment preparation to include medical controlled substances, cold-chain, and HAZMAT products; <br />&bull; Preparing all shipping and Customs paperwork, and obtaining Customs approvals;<br />&bull; Preparing the paperwork and obtaining any applicable national Health Ministry approvals; <br />&bull; Providing international Freight Forwarding services;<br />&bull; Tracking of shipments from point of origin to customer receipt;<br />&bull; Providing quality assurance, quality control, and regular performance information, statistics, and feedback to both the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and to the customers;<br />&bull; Supporting medical contingency and special project initiatives.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that we require industry input on how our posts can obtain the drugs and other medical supplies required by our posts in a fast and efficient manner that is not going to cost a fortune in new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Please send your information by email to our medical procurement improvement team. Please use all the following email addresses: HalprinandreottaC@state.gov; WaltersJM@state.gov; boufordrw@state.gov; FrankfurtRPSO@state.gov. In order to move this project ahead in a timely manner, please provide you suggestions, company information, and other input not later than May 4, 2011. We would also appreciate you sending a short email by April 20, 2011 indicating that you are interested in helping us and&nbsp;will be making&nbsp;submittal. Based on input received we may ask you some follow on questions. Your assistance in this vital project to potentially improve the health of our employees is greatly appreciated.</p>

(1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities.
(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells."
(b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend:
"The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."
(c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend:
"This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal."
(d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction.
(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.
(f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.

<a href="mailto:Mark.Ramey@us.army.mil">Fort Hood DOC</a>
<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract for a five-month period.  The MICC Fort Hood intends to enter into a non-competitive interim contract with the incumbent contractor, TSI CORP., 501 SOUTH RANCHO DR STE I-58, LAS VEGAS, NV, 89106-4838, to provide First Sergeants Barracks Program Maintenance Services for the period 1 May - 30 September 2011.  The incumbent is a small business under NAICS 561210, Facilities Support Services (Size Standard $35.5M).  The contract action calls for the contractor to provide all resources and management necessary to perform maintenance of Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH) facilities. Tasks include minor repair of carpentry, plumbing, electrical, painting, custodial, and other duties associated with repair, replacement, and maintenance of Government owned facilities.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract and will sustain critical performance during the procurement of the larger follow-on contract action.  Award of this interim contract to another contractor would entail a significant effort to phase-in, inventory and inspect a significant amount of government furnished property, and acclimate to the Fort Hood optempo.  It is therefore determined that there is the likelihood that a new contractor would suffer undue risk attempting to manage phase-in and provide continued high level contract support, making the attempt costly and inefficient for all parties.  Firms are requested to submit any questions/concerns regarding this non-competitive interim contract directly to the contract specialist at e-mail address: mark.ramey@us.army.mil and copy furnish the contracting officer at email address: leeann.burke@us.army.mil no later than 28 April 2011 at 2:00 p.m. CST.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with CEATI International, 1010 Rue Sherbrooke O Bureau 2500, Montreal, QC H3A 2R7. The requirement is for a membership with other electrical utility industry professionals who together, through focused interest groups and collaborative projects, identify and address technical issues that are critical to their organizations.  Participants can undertake projects that respond to their strategic goals at a fraction of the cost of doing so independently.  The need for international breadth and inter-industry applicability in technology development is addressed through a practical, dynamic, and cost effective program.  The membership provides each member with the ability to order research and development projects for the following collaborative programs:
"	Dam Safety Interest Group (DSIG)"	Hydraulic Plant Life Interest Group (HPLIG)"	Water Management Interest Group (WMIG)"	Strategic Options for Sustainable Power Generation Interest Group (SOIG)"	Infrastructure Protection and Security Technical Program Services
Through the interest group approach, leverages the collaboration of all its members to perform research on issues related to generating and transmitting power, water management and dam safety.  Through this method, research, review, and the subsequent reports can be obtained at a highly discounted rate.  In addition, membership provides access to world class producers, services, and partnership opportunities related to research and development, bench marking, networking, learning, and information exchange.  Membership also includes participation in quarterly meetings and access to research and development projects and reports pertaining to the above mentioned business areas.  As such, the contractor shall meet the following minimum requirements:

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to increase small business awareness of a pending United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acquisition that offers potential subcontracting opportunities for small business participation. The solicitation will be issued no sooner than May 2011. USCIS intends to use the GSA's USA Contact suite of nine contracts for this acquisition. Information on USA Contact can be found at http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105215.
<p>Within USCIS, the Customer Service Directorate (CSD) operates the National Customer Service Center (NCSC). The NCSC was created to provide nationwide assistance to customers who contact USCIS by telephone with questions about immigration services and benefits, and with issues related to case processing. Depending on the complexity of the customer's issues, answers are provided by an Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Tier 1 contractors using scripts, or USCIS employees at Tier 2. This acquisition is for Tier 1 contact center services.</p>
<p>When a customer calls the NCSC's general service number, the call is first routed to a network based Interactive Voice Response (IVR). During normal business hours, if the IVR is unable to meet the customer's need, the call is automatically routed via the Verizon Business Networx network-based intelligent call routing to the next available customer service representative (CSR) at a Contractor-operated and staffed Call Center, or to the appropriate USCIS direct routing point where appropriate. Tier 1 service is provided in both English and Spanish. CSRs use Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), scripts, and operational guidelines developed by USCIS to assist customers. More than 85% of callers requesting live assistance currently receive answers to their questions at Tier 1.</p>
<p>If the questions go beyond the scripted responses, then the CSRs can transfer the calls to the next level (Tier 2) which consists of USCIS Immigration Service Officers who can provide technical and detailed answers.<br /><br />The services needed require the contractor to provide CSR staffing, management support, implementation of contact center standard operating procedures, establishment of a contact center facility (ies), and requisite information technology infrastructure to support system and communication needs. The contractor operations shall be supported by business continuity of operations and contingency plans to ensure minimal disruption of service. The underlying technology used will capitalize on evolving; leading edge solutions while maintaining sufficient flexibility in design to adjust to fluctuations in call volumes to accommodate necessary expansion.</p>
<p><br />This acquisition is to provide contact center services to support the NCSC, which operates under US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The objective of the solicitation is to award two Task Orders against the GSA's USA Contact suite of IDIQ contracts to support the NCSC in providing information related to immigrant and non-immigrant benefits by employing a customer contact center approach. <br />This notice is published to provide Small Businesses information on potential subcontracting opportunities. No further FedBizOpps notices will be published.</p>
<p>Points of Contact for USCIS are Ned Ross, Contracting Officer, at Ned.r.ross@dhs.gov or 802-872-4646, and Stephen K. Hill, Contract Specialist, at Stephen.k.hill@dhs.gov, or 802-872-4197, ext. 4421.</p>

<DESC>Environmental Restoration and Remediation of the former Energy Technology Engineering Center Site
Proposal Disallowed Reason:This is a master solicitation; therefore, proposals cannot be submitted directly on this solicitation.  Proposals must be submitted under the appropriate program area.
Description:The Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management Consolidated Business Center (EMCBC) Office of Contracting, intends to issue a sole source modification to extend the period of performance under contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to provide for interim services to safely and economically maintain and monitor the Energy Technology Engineering Center (ETEC) site during the period required to complete the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) for Area IV of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) as well as include an option for Decontamination, Decommissioning and Demolition activities.  On May 2, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Natural Resources Council et al. v. DOE et al.) issued a decision which directed DOE to complete an EIS and ROD for Area IV of the SSFL.  The EIS and ROD for Area IV SSFL are being performed by another DOE contractor under a task order with DOE, with com pletion scheduled for August 31, 2013.  The current period of performance for contract DE-AC03-99SF21530 with Boeing ends September 30, 2011.  The required period for which the contract will be extended will end September 30, 2014.  
The services required for the extension period are necessary to provide continuity of facilities operation and site support services as well as include an option for Decontamination, Decommissioning and Demolition (DD&D) activities.  The facilities operation and site support services include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Work associated with RCRA Facility Investigation Report development for groundwater, including characterization and document preparation in response to the State of California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) DTSC Consent Order for Corrective Action (Docket No. P3-07/08-003, Aug 16, 2007);
- Work associated with the requirements to retrieve and produce all historical documents and records, including photographs, maps, figures of SSFL and surrounding areas, data table summaries and bibliographies, as required by the State of California EPA DTSC Control Consent Order for Corrective Action (Docket No. P3-07/08-003, August 16, 2007);
- Perform all environmental monitoring within Area IV of the SSFL as required by regulations, statutes, and DOE policy;
- Provide support to the DOE EIS contractor (currently CDM); 
- Provide support to the US EPA as they conduct the radiological characterization survey for Area IV and the Northern Undeveloped Land;
- Place all buildings into a safe shutdown mode, ensuring that all buildings are maintained in a safe and stable configuration throughout the performance period or until facility demolition;
- Complete disposition of newly generated wastes resulting from maintenance, monitoring, analyses or characterization activities; and
- All safety and health, landlord activities, program support, waste management and all other related activities described in the Statement of Work for contract DE-AC03-99SF21530.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The present contract with Boeing is due to expire on September 30, 2011.  The contract extension will include the services needed to (1) safely and economically maintain and monitor the ETEC site in a state that assures the protection of the workers, the public, and the environment; include an option for DD&D activities; and (2) comply with all applicable laws and regulations and DOE policy.  Continuation of site services without interruption through September  30, 2014 will facilitate fulfillment of the May 2, 2007, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Natural Resources Council et al. v. DOE et al.) decision which directed DOE to complete an EIS and ROD for Area IV of the SSFL., the August 2007 Consent Order, and the December 2010 Administrative Order on Consent.
During the extended period of performance for contract DE-AC03-99SF21530, DOE expects to conduct a competitive acquisition for remediation activities required to complete closure of the ETEC site.

This award of this  sole source contract  was made  to Carefusion Solutions, LLC located at 3750 Torrey View Court, San Diego, CA 92130-2635.

The period of performance will be from April 1, 2011 to September 30, 2011.  
A solicitation/synopsis will not be issued as this is an urgent need, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-2.

This requirement satisfies an urgent need as the Pyxis medical stations are necessary for distribution of medication to veterans and any disruption in service would adversely affect direct patient care.  This award is for a limited six month period from April 1, 2011 to September 30, 2011 and will be awarded competitively, through GSA/FAA, at the beginning of fiscal year 2012, beginning on October 1, 2011.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is implemented by FAR 6.302-2 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

<DESC>The Division of Contracts, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate and award a short-term, sole-source bridge contract with L-3 Communications Government Services, Inc., for IT infrastructure services and support.
<p>On February 18, 2011, the NRC competitively awarded a contract for Information Technology Infrastructure and Support Services (ITISS) to Perot Systems Government Services, Inc., as a result of Solicitation No. RFP-33-11-325. A protest of that contract award was filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on March 9, 2011. In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), performance of that new contract has been stayed pending resolution of the protest.</p>
<p>Presently, information technology infrastructure services are being provided by the incumbent contractor, L-3, under the NRC's Infrastructure Services and Support Contract (ISSC), which expires on June 27, 2011. The NRC requires uninterrupted service until after the GAO protest is resolved and for a reasonable period of time thereafter to transition to the new contract. Therefore, the NRC anticipates negotiating and awarding a short-term "bridge" contract with L-3 to continue the services throughout the new transition period. The bridge contract is anticipated to include a base period of four (4) months and one (1) two-month option to extend the term of the contract if that should become necessary. The bridge contract may also include the clause at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.237-3, Continuity of Services.</p>
<p>The proposed bridge contract will require L-3 to provide planning, staffing, supervision, management, and leased IT hardware and software resources necessary to ensure the effective and efficient support, administration and control of the leased IT infrastructure and desktop computers, as well as operating maintaining, and upgrading the NRC Distributed Computing Environment.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a competitive acquisition for this short-term need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>The following Section 508 Standards will apply to this new short-term contract with L-3:</p>
<p>(1) Subpart B -- Technical Standards: 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems, 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.16 rules, 1194.25 Self contained, closed products, 1194.26 Desktop and portable computers;</p>
<p>(2) Subpart C -- Functional Performance Criteria: 1194.31 Functional performance criteria; and</p>
<p>(3) Subpart D -- Information, Documentation, and Support: 1194.41 Information, Documentation, and Support.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p>The purchase of 16 Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits, each kit consisting of the following: <br />Each kit of pre-conditioned hoses consists of two each 8" x 8" starter sections, four each 25' x 8" PCA hoses, eight each 25' x 6' PCA hoses, two each 10' x 8"double "Y" with closure. These hoses will be green in color.</p>
<p><br />Mfr: PCA Hose Systems, Inc. or equal</p>
<p>Justification for Brand Name or Equal Only: We need a hook and loop Velcro fitting that is at least 6" wide to maintain a stronger grip with distinctive features of a flat hose with edge bindings that keep the hose from twisting, making it easier to store, reduce scuffing, increase longevity, prevent damage to the aircraft and will not be damaged if driven over. The three part construction of the hoses consist of the outer layer which is oil resistant, waterproof, 18/20 ounce vinyl coated, 1000 denier polyester fabric. The second layer is open-cell foam and the bottom layer is 420 Denier Nylon coated fabric which is used on air bags. This material prevents aircraft damage caused by flaking and cracking of the inner liner that could possibly cause health issues. All hoses and connections are independently pressure tested to 50' in water for 5 minutes. We already have hoses of this type that are currently used by F-15 and C-5 Maintenance Units and we need the same type hoses in order to match up with theirs for conformity. We have repair kits for this type of hose and they need to able to work between squadrons for enhanced repair capability.</p>

Non-renewable energy projects are deemed cost effective if they achieve a simple payback of 10 years or less and have a savings to investment ratio (SIR) of 1.2 or greater.<br>Environmental Hazards - <br>The proposed project has the potential to disturb known and unknown asbestos, lead, and mold hazards.  <br>ASBESTOS<br>Areas identified as having asbestos hazards may include the window caulking, exterior window glazing, pipe fitting and insulation, radiator pad insulation, floor tiles, mastic, mastic dots, fire doors, air cell duct insulation pads, and other assumed asbestos containing materials (ACM).  When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling or demolition activities, microscopic fibers become airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs, where they can cause significant health problems for both employees at the DCARNG and contractors.  Proper care must be taken during the renovation to either not disturb these areas or conduct a complete remediation and disposal following 29 CFR 1926.1101, 40 CFR 61, and the District of Columbia Municipal Regulation -Title 20, Chapter 8.  The workers shall be competent and possess the proper licenses and permits to conduct the asbestos abatement.<br>LEAD/LEAD-BASED PAINT<br>Lead-based paint hazards are also present in the areas proposed for this project.  Concentrations of lead above the standards can be found on many of the surfaces including windows (which may also contain lead glass), walls, radiator covers, doors, door frames, ceilings, and other painted surfaces.  Common renovation activities like sanding, cutting, and demolition can create hazardous lead dust and chips by disturbing lead-based paint, which can be harmful to adults and children.  To protect against this risk, EPA issued a rule requiring the use of lead-safe practices and other actions aimed at preventing lead poisoning. Under the rule, beginning in April 2010, contractors performing renovation, repair and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities, and schools built before 1978 must be certified and must follow specific work practices to prevent lead contamination.  The DCARNG, although not a home, child care facility, or school, requires that 40 CFR 745 be followed.  Additionally, the DCARNG requires that 29 CFR 1926, 29 CFR 1910, 24 CFR 35 and the District of Columbia's Lead-Hazard Prevention and Elimination Act of 2008 be followed.  Workers shall be competent and possess the proper licenses and permits to conduct any lead paint abatement.<br>MOLD<br>In the proposed areas for this project there may or may not be mold contamination.  If more than 25 contiguous feet mold is found, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's "Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings" guidance shall be used in conjunction with 29 CFR 1910 and 29 CFR 1926.<br><br>DISPOSAL<br>Any materials removed during the abatement(s) shall be disposed of following the regulations noted above as well as any RCRA regulations that may apply.  The waste shall be taken to an appropriate and legal landfill.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format specified in FAR SUBPART 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number for this acquisition is NHLBI-CSB-(HO)-2011-165-RMD and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51 (April 11, 2011).  The total contracted dollar amount, including options, will not exceed $6.5 million.

This acquisition is being conducted on a competitive basis as a total small business set aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 611430  Professional and Management Development Training and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 million. 

The period of performance of this acquisition is anticipated to be from June 1, 2011 through January 31, 2012.

The Governments acceptance terms and FOB destination point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), intends to award a fixed price purchase order for leadership development services as described below:

Statement of Work:

Leadership development is a foundation of succession planning at the National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  The NHLBI Succession Plan focuses on training and development initiatives to prepare high potential employees for leadership roles.  To address the NHLBI leadership development needs in a timely and comprehensive manner and to provide necessary training and experience to high potential leaders resulting in their career growth, the NHLBI has approved a new leadership development program titled the NHLBI Leadership Lab.

The NHLBI Leadership Lab will include traditional cohort learning activities, as well as challenging assignments and management involvement.  The program is designed as a leadership development program that includes nine one-day cohort sessions every three to four weeks over a 7-month period and non-classroom components for 24 participants.

The contractor shall provide leadership development services to enhance leadership competencies and training needs identified by participants and the NHLBI.

Program design must include:

1.	Interest Based Negotiation: Based upon the principles introduced in Roger Fishers seminal text, Getting to Yes, Interest based negotiation is a methodology designed to produce outcomes superior to those typically achieved in position-based negotiation (i.e., negotiations focused on fixed positions and opposing viewpoints, which often result in compromises or impasses).  Interest based negotiation is also designed to improve the efficiency (or reduce the transactional costs) of negotiations and collaborations.

2.	Results Based Accountability TM: Results Based Accountability TM is a framework and set of skills for ensuring both disciplined decision-making and accountability for achieving desired results.  Key principles include the use of (1) data to align day-to-day decision making with the achievement of desired ends and (2) transparency to drive innovation by surfacing and challenging assumptions.

3.	Situational Leadership: Method that instructs NHLBIs managers in the skill of diagnosing an individuals development level on a specific goal or task, then adapting their leadership style to match the situation. It offers a strategy for aligning individual goals to NHLBIs goals.  The role of the situational leader is to provide direct reports with whatever it takesgoals, direction, training, support, feedback, or recognitionto develop their skills, motivation, and confidence.  Situational leadership creates a partnership between managers and staff that enables staff to feel empowered.

4.	Strengths-Based Leadership: Effective leadership is about a leader maximizing their strengths.  According to research conducted by Gallup, effective leaders must know their strengths and invest in others strengths, get people with the right strengths on their group, and understand and meet the four basic needs of those who look to them for leadership

The contractor shall:

	Manage the NHLBI Leadership Lab that results in agile leaders who have the skills to lead in a culture of dynamic change.
	Provide a draft program design to include proposed content for each session.
	Provide the processes and steps the contractor followed in developing the initiatives for the Leadership Lab.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determine at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

B.2 STATEMENT OF WORK

Contractor is to provide a Research Investigator to provide oversight of geographic modeling analyses (GIS) to support the VA HSR&D funded study, IIR 10-"Spatio-Temporal Spread of Newer Antipsychotics for Bipolar Disorder and PTSD," Mark Bauer, M.D. (Principal Investigator).

Primary duties include, but are not limited to: 

1.	The construction of spatiotemporal clusters of prescribing events.
2.	The application of appropriate control prescribing events to maximize signal-to-noise ratio. 
3.	The preparation of spatiotemporal clusters for analysis with generalized estimating equations and HGLM for this series.
4.	Participation in project meetings to coordinate activities with other project staff and to update the project team on findings.
5.	Consultation with project staff as needed.

The Center for Organization, Leadership and Management Research (COLMR), an HSR&D Center of Excellence at the VA Boston Healthcare System, seeks to examine the use of newer, "second generation" antipsychotics (SGAs) which is of substantial importance to the VHA and the Veterans we serve.  SGAs now represent 4 of the top 10 most costly drugs in the VHA, accounting for expenditures of over $350M/year.  Much of this use is not evidence-based, and identifying the factors that contribute to the spread of SGA prescribing will support the development of maximally effective and efficient interventions to guide prescriber behavior.  Geographic methods provide an innovative, large-scale approach to understanding the spread of prescribing, integrating provider, practice, and patient characteristics into one empirical model that can be used to design and target provider behavior change interventions.  This study utilizes VHA national datasets to model the spread of SGA prescribing for two serious mental illnesses of high cost and priority to the VHA: bipolar disorder and PTSD.  This study also tests and refines diffusion theory, which underlies the majority of provider behavior change strategies within and beyond the VHA.

GHRI will provide an expert Research Investigator in the field of applying GIS techniques to questions regarding the spread of antipsychotic use. The candidate will assist the project team in conducting complex analyses and analyzing and reporting their findings.

Contractor candidate must have the following qualifications:

1.	Extensive experience in geographic modeling analyses (GIS).
2.	Extensive experience in applying GIS techniques to questions regarding the spread of antipsychotic use.
3.	Ability to apply complex GIS systems theory to examine empirical and case study findings.
4.	Experience with VA research methods.

Contractor is required to submit to Dr. Bauer and the project manager their findings.    
Contractor will perform his duties at 1730 Minor Ave. Suite 1600 Seattle, WA 98101.

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
 
   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--
 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
 
     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This amendment is to provide clarification as stated below:<br /><br />1500 sq/ft of just the BSL3 lab. The remainder of the lab is not included in the proposal. The BSL lab is the only lab to be commissioned
<p>The responses are due 18 April 2011 in accordance with the amended solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Soundness of approach would be the method the company would test or inspect a particular item within the attached standards in the PWS. For example: "Testing of BSCs meets required specifications after installation"--how does company x address this requirement and what approach do they use? What monitoring equipment do they use to test the air exchange or velocity? Are their technicians certified to do this type of monitoring or will this be a task subcontracted.</p>

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;5352.242-9000 Contractor access to Air Force installations. <br />As prescribed in 5342.490-1, insert a clause substantially the same as the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and State Police Background Check to obtain a vehicle pass.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>
<p>(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>
<p>(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.</p>
<p>(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

<DESC>Question and Answers submitted:<br><br>Q: Regarding the ramp M1918, part #4 calls out a length of 8.85" long and I believe this is incorrect as it slips into the side channels (which are not called out or length given). If I could get the length across the top of the ramp as well as the length of the side channels I would appreciate it. Using the material lengths given it adds up to just under 50". If I use the other dims given to determine the length at the top (using AUTOCAD) it comes out to 52".<br><br>A:<br>1. The length at the narrow end is 52 inches. Picture is attached.<br>2. Side Length is 30 inches, picture attached.<br><br>Response date and time remain unchanged.  <br>

<DESC>1)	Question: What is the expected annual delivery requirement for the 36% Ferric Chloride?<br><br>1)	Answer:  The usual delivery of ferric chloride is three to four a year approximately 2000 gallons each delivery.<br><br>2)	Question: The solicitation states that approx. 1500 gallons of 50% Ferric Chloride will be needed. However, the question answered in the amended version suggests that yearly consumption is up to 8000 gallons. 1500 gallons is only ~19% of the yearly usage. Is the 1500 gallon figure accurate?<br><br>2)	Answer: Yes, I could use approximately 8,000 gallons in a year.  However, there is only enough capacity for 3,000 gallons.  Therefore, I place orders in the amount of 1,500 to 2,000 gallons on each delivery. <br><br>3)	Question: Is this a one-time purchase request or does the end user actually want his annual needs met at ~1500 gallons/delivery and this would be for an annual contract?<br><br>3)	Answer: This is a one year contract with deliveries on request throughout the year of approximately 1500 to 2000 gallons at a time.  Probably three to four deliveries during that time span.<br><br>The combined synopsis/ solicitation number is W91ZLK-11-T-0127.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Tunisia country program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Tunisia will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Embassy and as appropriate any future USAID presence in Tunisia. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition in Tunisia. In close coordination with the Embassy and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia-Middle East (AME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in (Tunis, Tunisia). While the post is currently still a family-accompanied post and does allow minor or adult dependents, depending on the security situation, this could change quickly to a non-accompanied post that would not allow minor or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not at this time seeking proposals. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov). Interested parties are advised to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>CBP is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whose mission is prevent the illegal flow of people and goods across U.S. air, land, and sea borders while expediting the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce. As the nation's single, unified border agency, CBP's mission is vitally important for the protection of the American people and the national economy. <br /><br />CBP represents the first line of defense of America's borders. One of CBP's strategic <br />objectives is to establish and maintain effective control of air, land, and maritime borders <br />with the appropriate mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel. An integral component to this situational awareness is the use of unattended ground sensor technology that provides information on the location of potential illegal border entries.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>CBP consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for unattended ground sensor technology. CBP plans to utilize unattended ground sensor technology to enhance agents' ability to detect, track, identify, and classify illegal incursions and to provide CBP agents with improved situational awareness between the Ports of Entry (POE). The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market.</p>
<p>CBP is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated unattended ground sensor technology systems described in the following sections. CBP intends to deploy these sensors as part of a tailored, layered approach to improve situational awareness along the U.S. Southwest Border. There is no intent to develop any items or systems under this program. CBP intends to make maximum use of an open systems approach and desires the system to be in full production as defined by Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) Publication Number: 09-01.03.02.13-02.</p>
<p>Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist CBP in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.</p>

Three of the programs - System Wide Information Management (SWIM), Data Communications (DataComm), and NAS Voice System (NVS) - are designated as "NextGen-enabling" programs because of their fundamental role in supporting the transformation of the NAS to the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The ECSS Contractors will provide vital support to the planning, procurement, implementation, and execution of these and other ATC Communications programs as they progress through their life cycles. 
The contracts will provide a broad range of Program Management, Acquisition Support, System Engineering, Operations Management and Support, Business and Financial Management, and other services required by the Directorate.  The requirements are more fully described in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  
3. Nature of the CompetitionThe FAA is contemplating award of two competitive single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts (one unrestricted competition and one small business set-aside) each with periods of performance of seven years (two year base and five one-year option periods).
4. NAICS CodeThe NAICS codes for the small business set-aside have not yet been finalized, but are currently expected to be:- 541330, Engineering Services - Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, $27M; and - 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, 1,500 employees.
5. Incumbent ContractorsThe ATC Communications Directorate currently obtains its support services through a wide variety of large and small business service contracts and task orders, most of which are expiring in the next 12 to 18 months.  The current level of effort is approximately 350-380 full-time equivalents (FTEs), but the FAA expects that quantity to decrease under the ECSS contracts due to organizational realignments and other efficiency gains.  However, the ECSS contractors must be capable of sustaining the current level of support if the expected efficiency gains cannot be realized.  The specific staffing requirements will be definitized through the issuance of task orders and the FTE levels referenced in this announcement do not represent a commitment on the part of the FAA to staff the ECSS contracts at a particular level of effort.
6. Contract TypeThe FAA anticipates awarding IDIQ type contracts with Fixed Price Level of Effort task orders being issued for the required support services. 
7. Responses to the Market Survey/RFIInterested parties should submit the following items in response to this Market Survey/RFI by January 3, 2011.(a) A one page letter of transmittal.(b) A two page Capabilities Statement (12 point Times New Roman font, 1 inch margins) that includes the following information: Type of services provided by your company relative to the scope of the ECSS effort as described in the draft SIR.

<DESC>Proposers' Day Announcement for the IARPA Finder Program - IARPA-BAA-11-05<br />Solicitation Number: IARPA-BAA-11-05<br />Agency: Office of the Director of National Intelligence<br />Office: Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, Incisive Analysis Office
<p><br />Synopsis: <br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Finder Program on May 11, 2011, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Finder Program to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />It is common today for even consumer-grade cameras to tag the images and videos that they capture with the location of the camera on the earth's surface ("geolocation"). But, some imagery does not have a geolocation tag and it is important to know the location of the camera or image, and hence objects in the scene. For this imagery, analysts work hard to deduce as much as they can using reference data from many sources, including overhead and ground-based images, digital elevation data, existing well-understood image collections, surface geology, geographic and cultural information. However, such image/video geolocation is an extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive activity that often meets with limited success.</p>
<p>A growing set of research and consumer-oriented systems have developed useful and relevant capabilities using techniques that include large-scale ground-level image acquisition, crowd-sourcing, and sophisticated image matching. These largely automated systems tend to work best in geographic areas with significant population densities or that are well traveled by tourists, and where the query image or video contains notable features such as mountains or buildings.</p>
<p>The Finder Program aims to build on existing research systems to develop technology that augments the analyst's expertise to address the geolocation task. Required technical innovations include 1) efficient and effective use of analyst time and knowledge, 2) effective use of a wide variety of data sources, 3) fusion of diverse publicly available imperfect reference data, and 4) expansion of automated geolocation technologies to work efficiently and accurately over all terrain and large search areas. If successful, Finder will deliver rigorously tested technology capable of addressing the geolocation task for images and video anywhere on the land surface of the earth.<br />Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary, including: computer vision, geography, geology, statistical inference, photogrammetry, and computer science.</p>
<p>IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this program. Researchers will be able to and are encouraged to publish their findings in publicly available, academic journals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br /><strong>Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern May 4, 2011 at </strong><a href="https://conference.brtrc.com/Finder_pd/Overview.aspx"><strong>https://conference.brtrc.com/Finder_pd/Overview.aspx</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to dni-iarpa-baa-11-05@ugov.gov. Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a first-to-ask basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm Eastern) May 4, 2011. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization. The IARPA Program Manager will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@ugov.gov.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-11-05@ugov.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Add The Following To Description:<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern May 4, 2011 at </strong><a href="https://conference.brtrc.com/Finder_pd/Overview.aspx"><strong>https://conference.brtrc.com/Finder_pd/Overview.aspx</strong></a><strong>.<br /></strong></p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: <br />United States Africa Command/ C4 Systems</p>
<p>Contracting Activity:<br />DITCO-Europe/PL512</p>
<p><br />2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM)/ Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4S) Directorate has a requirement to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract or purchase order as a sole source through CODAN US Inc for the purchase of High Frequency (HF) equipment items listed as per the attached. 90 days after receipt of order, the High Frequency radio equipment must be delivered with export licenses, operators must be trained, and the High Frequency radio network must be operational.</p>
<p>CODAN US Inc, the sole US subsidiary of the CODAN Limited group of companies, currently manufactures and supplies High Frequency radio systems to the United States Government (USG) through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and General Services Administration (GSA). Countries and programs include Afghanistan, Iraq and supply to Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan) through the Department of State. CODAN has also supplied High Frequency radios to many countries throughout Africa. These countries include Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. In addition, CODAN has also provided High Frequency radios to the African Union (AU) for peacekeeping forces and supplied over 150 High Frequency radios in 2006 to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to support the AU's peacekeeping mission in Darfur. CODAN provides service and support throughout the world via a network of dealers, distributors and agents. CODAN radio products are used in approximately 40 countries in Africa, as well as international entities in Africa, such as the African Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: High Frequency radios operate in the 3 to 30 megahertz range of the radio frequency spectrum. The radio transmissions propagate through the atmosphere via line of sight or via the ionosphere, where the maximum theoretical range is 10,000+ kilometers. High Frequency radio is inexpensive, and a well-understood technology that is used extensively by coalition military. It is usually a backup means of communication because of its limited bandwidth and antenna space requirements. However, High Frequency radio is often used as the primary means of communication in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance scenarios, as well as in situations where commercial information technology infrastructure is damaged or unavailable. For this reason, African partner nation personnel employ High Frequency radio more often than any other communications technology. The particular radios that are being considered for this effort are military-grade tactical radios that can securely communicate using both voice and data.</p>
<p>The African Union Command, Control, Communications and Information Systems program aims to enable communication between the African Union and the Regional Economic Centers, which control African Standby Forces. African Standby Forces are employed in a variety of peacekeeping missions on the continent of Africa. High Frequency radio can operate either in line of sight or beyond line of sight, making it the radio of choice vs. VHF or UHF radio which have greater constraints on their effective range. African Partner Nation personnel are familiar with High Frequency radio technology and currently employ it in their day-to-day activities. In addition, High Frequency radio can operate independent of infrastructure, to support communications in austere, disconnected mission locations that do not have available information technology infrastructure such as Internet service providers or satellite communications. If the Codan equipment is not purchased, the African Union headquarters, regional economic centers, and African Standby Forces will not have a means of secure communications. Non-secure means of communication could result in the compromise of the mission and possible loss of life. If a non-interoperable solution is chosen, the existing Harris-based High Frequency radio network supporting a current African Union mission will have to be redesigned or replaced, resulting in a monetary loss of approximately $.</p>
<p>The CODAN High Frequency radios employ encryption based on the non-proprietary Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which uses a 256-bit digital encryption key. The existing Harris radios used in a current African Union mission are also capable of using AES encryption The end-state goal is to enable secure voice and data communications between the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, African Union missions and the 5 regional economic centers.</p>
<p>The initial link will be established between the African Union Headquarters and The Economic Community for West African States. Follow-on communications will be established between the African Union Headquarters and a current African Union mission. Each link will operate on separate frequencies.</p>

<a href="mailto:melissa.k.koehn@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Design Build Contract, a long-term remedy for the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans area.  The purpose of the project is to provide storm surge risk reduction for the areas near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals from the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge, while not impeding the ability of the areas internal drainage system to function.  This includes design and construction of independent permanent gated storm surge barriers and pump stations at the discharge end of each canal.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacities of the three canals are: 17th Street, 12,500 cubic feet per second (cfs); Orleans Avenue, 2,700 cfs and London Avenue, 9,000 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234.  The existing Interim Closure Structures shall remain operational during the construction phase of the new pump stations.  The most technically effective means of accomplishing the dual purpose of storm surge risk reduction and simultaneous evacuation of storm water should be given highest consideration by offerors.  The contract will require a performance bond and payment bond for the design and construction effort, but the pumps, pump drivers, and generators may not necessarily be included in the bonding requirements.  The equipment may be procured under separate supply line items in the design-build contract.  Offerors may choose to take advantage of this arrangement by omitting the equipment from their bonds, but are not obligated to do so.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 237990 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $33.5 M.  An acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required for award.  It is anticipated that the RFP - Phase I (Request for Proposal  RFP I) will be issued April 2010, with the issuance of a Draft RFP  Phase II to the short-listed firms in the 2nd  Quarter of CY2010.  The estimated range of construction is over $500 million. However, this Design-Build project will have a build to budget amount.  The Government's intent is to maximize the best value obtainable for that ceiling amount.  In selecting the winning offer in Phase II, technical non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost/price.  However, the contract award for design and construction shall not exceed the ceiling amount.  The selection process will be structured such that offers that optimize technical/management solutions within the contract budget amount will be viewed more favorably than offers that attempt to trade off performance in favor of lower prices.  APPROACH and SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem, the Government intends to procure Design - Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers, Two  Phase Design-Build Selection Procedure (FAR Part 36.3).  In Phase I, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal Phase I and from those respondents, select, based on Past Performance and Technical Approach a short list of three (3) to five (5) firms.  After selection of the short-listed firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP - Phase II, the Government may engage in exchanges of information with the short-listed firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  For example, the Government will issue a draft RFP to the short-listed firms and request their feedback. In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  The Government will then issue RFP - Phase II and from that, select a single technical approach based on the Best Value Continuum Selection Method using the Tradeoff process.  To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the short-listed firms, along with design criteria.  The task of selecting the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the offerors.  It remains the responsibility of the offeror to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach.  Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3 for both phases of the RFP.  The evaluation criteria for Phase I, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Experience; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Approach.  The factors are listed above are all approximately equal in importance.  The evaluation criteria for Phase II, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Management Capability; and (3) Socio Economic Utilization.

<DESC>SEE UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM ON THE SYNOPSIS<BR><BR>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Design Build Contract, a long-term remedy for the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) in the New Orleans area.  The purpose of the project is to provide storm surge risk reduction for the areas near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals from the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge, while not impeding the ability of the areas internal drainage system to function.  This includes design and construction of independent permanent gated storm surge barriers and pump stations at the discharge end of each canal.  The project design criteria for the pumping capacities of the three canals are: 17th Street, 12,500 cubic feet per second (cfs); Orleans Avenue, 2,700 cfs and London Avenue, 9,000 cfs.  This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234.  The existing Interim Closure Structures shall remain operational during the construction phase of the new pump stations.  The most technically effective means of accomplishing the dual purpose of storm surge risk reduction and simultaneous evacuation of storm water should be given highest consideration by offerors.  The contract will require a performance bond and payment bond for the design and construction effort, but the pumps, pump drivers, and generators may not necessarily be included in the bonding requirements.  The equipment may be procured under separate supply line items in the design-build contract.  Offerors may choose to take advantage of this arrangement by omitting the equipment from their bonds, but are not obligated to do so.  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 237990 and the Size Standard for Small Business is $33.5 M.  An acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be required for award.  It is anticipated that the RFP - Phase I (Request for Proposal  RFP I) will be issued on or before 03 May 2010, with the issuance of a Draft RFP  Phase II to the short-listed firms in the 2nd  Quarter of CY2010.  The estimated range of construction is over $500 million. However, this Design-Build project will have a build to budget amount.  The Government's intent is to maximize the best value obtainable for that ceiling amount.  In selecting the winning offer in Phase II, technical non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost/price.  However, the contract award for design and construction shall not exceed the ceiling amount.  The selection process will be structured such that offers that optimize technical/management solutions within the contract budget amount will be viewed more favorably than offers that attempt to trade off performance in favor of lower prices.  APPROACH and SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem, the Government intends to procure Design - Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers, Two  Phase Design-Build Selection Procedure (FAR Part 36.3).  In Phase I, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal Phase I and from those respondents, select, based on Past Performance and Technical Approach a short list of three (3) to five (5) firms.  After selection of the short-listed firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP - Phase II, the Government may engage in exchanges of information with the short-listed firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  For example, the Government will issue a draft RFP to the short-listed firms and request their feedback. In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  The Government will then issue RFP - Phase II and from that, select a single technical approach based on the Best Value Continuum Selection Method using the Tradeoff process.  To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the short-listed firms, along with design criteria.  The task of selecting the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the offerors.  It remains the responsibility of the offeror to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach.  Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3 for both phases of the RFP.  The evaluation criteria for Phase I, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Experience; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Approach.  The factors are listed above are all approximately equal in importance.  The evaluation criteria for Phase II, consists of three (3) Technical (non-cost) factors and a Price Factor.  The Technical (non-cost) factors are: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Management Capability; and (3) Socio Economic Utilization.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SD VOSB), HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.  The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR SubPart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.  The subcontracting goals for this District are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be places with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBZone SB; (5) 3.5 for VOSB; and (6) at least 2.0% for SD VOSB.  SHARING OF KEY TECHNICAL DATA: The Government intends to provide a stipend in the amount of $500,000 to the Phase II unsuccessful offerors.  Offerors must make it to Phase II in order to be considered for stipend. <BR><BR>PRE PROPOSAL CONFERENECE<BR>The Government will hold a preproposal conference on 3 May 2010, 8:30 a.m. Central Time, Airport Hilton (901 Airline Drive) Kenner, LA, 70062.  Sign in to begin at 8:00 am. with the conference beginning at 8:30 am.  It is encouraged that all prospective Offerors attend.

Written questions must be received no later than three (3) days prior to the pre-proposal conference.  The submission of written questions will not preclude anyone from posing questions during the conference.

<DESC>I.  The following questions and answers are provided for information purposes under this Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).   Should an RFP or draft RFP be issued, it may contain terms and conditions that differ from the answers provided below:

Q1. Can this assembly and distribution project be performed in any state or is there a specific area of the US that is recommended or required?
A1.  There is no recommended, suggested, or required geographical location for the services contemplated as long as all applicable laws, regulations, and policies are addressed. The Government does not intend to provide facilities to support this effort.

Q2.  Is there a recommended, suggested or required geographical (US, state, city) location for the warehousing and services that are requested?
A2.
  See A1 above. 

Q3.	Will there be a requirement that any or all of the Medical Products be stored in air-conditioned or refrigerated space and if so, what are the temperatures required?
A3.  	There is a requirement to maintain items according to manufacturers directions to protect the efficacy and service life. Temperature ranges vary according to item. Please refer to Attachment 1 to the RFI Announcement for item listings.

Q4. Do some of the inventory items require specific temperature zones for storage and distribution and if so, what is the temperature range?
A4.  See A3 above.

Q5.  Will there be any receiving, shipping (units, cases) or estimated space required data that will be available for this Solicitation?
A5.
 The Government will provide space, cube, and weight estimates with the anticipated Draft RFP materials. The Government anticipates the necessity of some Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) as the Marine Corps has specific packaging requirements.

Q6.  Will there be a term agreement, 1, 2, 3, 5, year contract?
A6.  Response: Per the RFI announcement, MCSC anticipates that this Concept Pilot effort is a multiple year effort, potentially one base year plus two option years. The Government invites suggestions as to the most effective period of performance for the potential enterprise-wide rollout of the piloted solution.

Q7. Regarding the outbound distribution: Will this be performed by military, contracted non-military or, FEDEX, UPS, USPS?
A7.
  During the Concept Pilot, the Government anticipates that the service provider will be responsible for transportation of goods from its location(s) to any one of the USMCs Medical Logistics Company locations. MEDLOGS are at the following locations: Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCB Kaneohe Bay, HI; Camp Lejeune, NC; Newport News, VA; Camp Kinser, Okinawa. Until delivery/acceptance at the Medical Logistics Companys dock, the service provider has custody of the inventory, is responsible for the GFE, and owns the non-GFE line items.


II. The following information is provided regarding sterilization:

Sterilization of surgical instrumentation issued in AMALs/ADALs is performed by the Medical Logistics Companies  and is completed at regular intervals by a Surgical Instrument Technologist.
 All surgical gear issued to deploying units is to be handled in accordance to AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) and AORN (Association of periOperative Registered Nurses) surgical sterility regulations. Surgical instruments must be prepared, organized, and packed in surgical sets in accordance to AMAL/ADAL configurations.  The Government anticipates that this sterilization function will be performed by the service provider using qualified sterilization personnel.  Qualified sterilization personnel are likely to be surgical instrument technicians who are aware of OSHA/AAMI/AORN regulations and recommended practices. No government-furnished sterilization equipment is available for this effort.

III.
  Non-GFE Medical Equipment and Supplies

The 3PL provider will be responsible for furnishing the required non-GFE medical equipment and supplies via its own existing relationships with medical equipment/supply providers, not through established Government medical supply contracts such as DLA or PM CSE Prime vendor contracts. The Government seeks to leverage the 3PLs supply chain relationships in order to maximize buying power, minimize inventory levels, and improve operational readiness.

IV.  Industry Day

The Government plans to conduct an Industry Event at Camp Lejeune, NC, on 24-25 May 2011. 

A limited number of individual sessions can be arranged with the MCSC team by appointment to discuss company qualifications and any suggested best practice information.
 Individual sessions will not exceed 30 minutes each and will be conducted on 25 May 2011.

Participation for the Industry Event and the individual sessions is limited and registration will be on a first come, first served basis. 

Please register your intent to participate with Mr. Mark Sanderson at mark.sanderson@usmc.mil, no later than 04 May 2011.  Also indicate whether you are requesting an individual session.  Further details regarding the Industry Event will be distributed as they become available.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This R&D effort is to conduct an investigation into development and application of state-of-the-art wireless Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to provide an improved, more cost effective surveillance and distribution system to maximize the quality and nutritional value of combat rations and ultimately fresh fruits and vegetables (FFV) consumed by deployed military forces in operational theaters.

<DESC>This notice is informational only.&nbsp; This requriement is being competed under NASA SEWP.<br /><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER'S STATEMENT REGARDING<br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
<p>EMC Storage Area Network Equipment Upgrade/Replacement</p>
<p><br />1. Identification of Agency and the Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>US Forest Service, WO-CIO</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved:</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification approval is hereby requested for upgrade and partial replacement of EMC storage area network (SAN) equipment required to support the FS information technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need Including Estimated the Value:</p>
<p>3.1 Services Required:<br />Experienced EMC personnel or authorized agents work with the Forest Service to deliver the engagement. This engagement includes the following sites and technologies:</p>
<p>Data Migration -Full Migration<br /><br />This part of the engagement includes the following components:<br />a. Existing physical hosts: 300<br />b. Existing enterprise directors: 6<br />c. Existing CLARiiON: 5<br />d. Existing SAN fabrics: 2<br />e. Source storage arrays involved: 2<br />f. Target storage arrays involved: 2<br />g. TB of useable source data to migrate: 200.00<br />h. Data migration events: 4<br />i. Hosts for test migrations: 2<br />During this part of the engagement: <br />j. Collects host environment configuration information using Storage tools.<br />k. Collects SAN switch and director information for analysis.<br />l. Collects existing CLARiiON storage configuration information.<br />m. Completes analysis of existing host data collected.<br />n. Completes analysis of existing switch and/or director information collected.<br />o. Performs analysis on existing CLARiiON data collected.<br />p. Performs discovery, correlation, and analysis of the migration environment.<br />q. Plans the migration solution.<br />r. Documents the proposed architecture in the Configuration Guide.<br />s. Develops the Test Plan.<br />t. Conducts an implementation review meeting.<br />u. Validates that the equipment is on-site at the appropriate location with power and cable requirements met.<br />v. Validates the migration environment to ensure the correct assets are migrated and that interoperability and performance are assured.<br />w. Verifies the network, server, or storage configuration changes.<br />x. Coordinates with the Forest Service technical staff on maintenance windows for planned events<br />y. Conducts test migrations.</p>
<p>3.2 Equipment Required:</p>
<p>CLARiiON Cx4-960 - 60SATA/40FC<br />Hardware<br />&bull; 5 Racks<br />&bull; (24) 8Gbps ports<br />&bull; 63 DAE<br />&bull; (655) 600GB 15K rpm drives (including 20 hot spares)<br />o 341TB useable<br />&bull; (285) 2TB drives 7200 rpm (including 10 hot spares)<br />o 501TB useable</p>
<p>4. Identification of the Justification Rationale (see 8.405-6(a) and (b)) and, if applicable, demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply and service:</p>
<p>EMC is a market leader in storage technology, so much so that the word "EMC" is routinely used when referring to storage technology. The EMC Storage technology provides familiar and functional storage technology for US Forest Service infrastructure.</p>
<p>The EMC storage technology has been the primary technology throughout the FS data center for the past 5 1/2 years and has been integrated into existing General Support System (GSS) and Application Hosting Environment (AHE) documentation, policy, and procedures. Changing to a different brand of storage technology would result in substantial increase in cost and complexity to the Forest Service. Switching to a different manufacture at this time would; require certification testing in the FS environment and accreditation documentation, re-training of SAN administration personnel on the use of an alternate storage technology would become unwieldy at this point in time, additional complexity in software management, procurement and licensing for a different vendor would not be an acceptable solution at this point in time. Currently the FS is embarking on a Storage Solution Architecture Plan, upon completion all further procurements will be based on this documentation.</p>
<p>An effective EMC storage technology for the data center is necessary for the migration of unstructured data, web technology, and applications from legacy Forest cells to the data center. The EMC storage technology provides a well known, familiar interface with minimal barriers to usability to Agency employees, application programmers, and contractors that need to support the FS Infrastructure. Due to the nature of the information it is critical to the Forest Service to maintain the continuity of the known storage technology in order to assure that there are no changes which would attribute to lack of training and getting used to a new systems as well as the break in service that would be required to obtain revised security, certification and accreditation documentation and retraining of personnel.</p>
<p>a) Leverage existing investment: The agency has already invested in the purchase of EMC hardware and software for use in the agency's data centers. Using this brand source alleviates possible compatibility issues, required testing and certification of new hardware and software, and delays in our ability to implement which would ultimately impact the DCI migration programs ability to complete the consolidation of 183 cells into the Kansas City Data Center by September 2011.</p>
<p>b) Reduce integration costs and time to market: FS support technicians will be able to use familiar software and hardware for initial installation, updates and administration. This is critical to maintain continuity of services in existence today.</p>
<p>c) Reduce support costs: Agency technicians have had extensive agency/vendor training to support EMC software and hardware.</p>
<p>d) Provide priority service: Due to the long-standing relationship with EMC, the agency would be provided priority service with a dedicated account manager working through the prime contractor to support FS purchases and provide support.</p>
<p>e) Other product specific advantages: This product allows the FS to take advantage of our work force that is trained to support EMC software and hardware and its integration into the agency's infrastructure.</p>
<p>&emsp;</p>
<p>5. Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d):</p>
<p>The initial SAN equipment purchased in the first phase was competitively acquired through NASA SEWP. The current competition will focus on which NASA SEWP IV offers the best value, price and other factors considered for the EMC brand equipment and related services. Price competition will be obtained through this RFQ.</p>
<p>6. A Description of Market Research Conducted Among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:</p>
<p>The initial SAN competition was performed in June 2009 on NASA SEWP with eight firms responding and award was made to the lowest priced technically capable firm. In February 2011 an RFI was posted on NASA SEWP to determine the availability of EMC equipment or equipment compatible with EMC to add 1 petabyte of additional storage to the existing Forest Service storage at the Kansas City Data Center. There were responses from 12 firms. None of the responding firms proposed EMC equipment.</p>
<p>Subsequent to receipt of RFI responses, the Kansas City Data Center informed the Forest Service that due to space and power limitations, no additional storage could be added beyond the current storage footprint and power usage. As a result, this requirement changed from one of simply adding storage capability to one of replacing the existing EMC storage equipment with new EMC equipment capable of storing more data within the existing rack space designated for Forest Service use.</p>
<p>Market research performed on 22 March 2011 showed there are 37 suppliers on NASA SEWP that can supply EMC equipment of which 21 are authorized EMC resellers.</p>
<p>7. Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>8. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers That Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made:</p>
<p>In the future when additional data storage is required, the Forest Service will review the status of the Kansas City, MO data center to determine if compatible non-EMC can be used. This will be accomplished by a detailed technical review and additional market research.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: <br />United States Africa Command/ C4 Systems</p>
<p>Contracting Activity:<br />DITCO-Europe/PL512</p>
<p><br />2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM)/ Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4S) Directorate has a requirement to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract or purchase order as a sole source through CODAN US Inc for the purchase of High Frequency (HF) equipment items listed as per the attached. 90 days after receipt of order, the High Frequency radio equipment must be delivered with export licenses, operators must be trained, and the High Frequency radio network must be operational.</p>
<p>CODAN US Inc, the sole US subsidiary of the CODAN Limited group of companies, currently manufactures and supplies High Frequency radio systems to the United States Government (USG) through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and General Services Administration (GSA). Countries and programs include Afghanistan, Iraq and supply to Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan) through the Department of State. CODAN has also supplied High Frequency radios to many countries throughout Africa. These countries include Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. In addition, CODAN has also provided High Frequency radios to the African Union (AU) for peacekeeping forces and supplied over 150 High Frequency radios in 2006 to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to support the AU's peacekeeping mission in Darfur. CODAN provides service and support throughout the world via a network of dealers, distributors and agents. CODAN radio products are used in approximately 40 countries in Africa, as well as international entities in Africa, such as the African Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: High Frequency radios operate in the 3 to 30 megahertz range of the radio frequency spectrum. The radio transmissions propagate through the atmosphere via line of sight or via the ionosphere, where the maximum theoretical range is 10,000+ kilometers. High Frequency radio is inexpensive, and a well-understood technology that is used extensively by coalition military. It is usually a backup means of communication because of its limited bandwidth and antenna space requirements. However, High Frequency radio is often used as the primary means of communication in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance scenarios, as well as in situations where commercial information technology infrastructure is damaged or unavailable. For this reason, African partner nation personnel employ High Frequency radio more often than any other communications technology. The particular radios that are being considered for this effort are military-grade tactical radios that can securely communicate using both voice and data.</p>
<p>The African Union Command, Control, Communications and Information Systems program aims to enable communication between the African Union and the Regional Economic Centers, which control African Standby Forces. African Standby Forces are employed in a variety of peacekeeping missions on the continent of Africa. High Frequency radio can operate either in line of sight or beyond line of sight, making it the radio of choice vs. VHF or UHF radio which have greater constraints on their effective range. African Partner Nation personnel are familiar with High Frequency radio technology and currently employ it in their day-to-day activities. In addition, High Frequency radio can operate independent of infrastructure, to support communications in austere, disconnected mission locations that do not have available information technology infrastructure such as Internet service providers or satellite communications. If the Codan equipment is not purchased, the African Union headquarters, regional economic centers, and African Standby Forces will not have a means of secure communications. Non-secure means of communication could result in the compromise of the mission and possible loss of life. If a non-interoperable solution is chosen, the existing Harris-based High Frequency radio network supporting a current African Union mission will have to be redesigned or replaced, resulting in a monetary loss of approximately $.</p>
<p>The CODAN High Frequency radios employ encryption based on the non-proprietary Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which uses a 256-bit digital encryption key. The existing Harris radios used in a current African Union mission are also capable of using AES encryption The end-state goal is to enable secure voice and data communications between the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, African Union missions and the 5 regional economic centers.</p>
<p>The initial link will be established between the African Union Headquarters and The Economic Community for West African States. Follow-on communications will be established between the African Union Headquarters and a current African Union mission. Each link will operate on separate frequencies.</p>

<p><br />The total dollar amount for the equipment items is $.</p>
<p>This procurement includes Equipment List as above. The funding will be Department of Defense.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: Pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i)</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The U.S. Africa Command previously purchased High Frequency radio equipment for the African Union from the Harris Corporation under a contract with DRS technologies. This equipment is in use for current African Union operations, and therefore represents the interoperability baseline. Harris Corporation has provided an interoperable solution for linking this mission network to a continent-wide C2 network. The Directorate of Defense Trade Control (DDTC) has classified multiple equipment items in the Harris Corporation solution as defense articles. Defense articles are governed by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) laws and require approval by the DDTC in order to obtain an export license. There are three (3) countries in the African Union which are on the ITAR's proscribed country list that prevents US Government engagement projects. Therefore, the US Africa Command will be unable to obtain an export license for the ITAR-restricted Harris equipment. Past efforts to obtain ITAR waivers for ITAR-restricted Harris equipment have failed.</p>
<p>The US Africa Command then performed a market survey to identify an alternative vendor that could meet mission requirements and the interoperability baseline. The market survey concluded that CODAN Inc demonstrates unique capabilities for radio interoperability, as demonstrated in Afghanistan. CODAN is the only vendor to offer exportable (i.e. non-ITAR-rated) equipment proven to meet mission requirements, operational goals and subsequent deadlines. CODAN High Frequency radios are manufactured and sold by an Australian company and thus governed and controlled by legislation issued by the Australian government. CODAN High Frequency radios are therefore not subject to the US Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the equipment does not require a commodity jurisdiction under the US Munitions List. An export license is only required by the Australian Government for encryption and frequency hopping modes only; the basic radio configuration does not require an export license.</p>
<p>Further, current CODAN High Frequency radio networks in Africa support African Union missions with the NGT series of High Frequency radios, internally fitted with CODAN CALM (CODAN Automatic Link Management) and CODAN Voice Encryption. CODAN is the only source of supply available to the African Union to ensure the High Frequency radios sought under this acquisition are fully interoperable with existing CODAN-based High Frequency radio networks. Technical interoperability comprises CODAN proprietary encryption, MIL-STD-188-141B Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), with CODAN Automatic Link Management certified via Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) and Over-The-Air (OTA) radio status capabilities. In addition, CODAN is able to provide high power High Frequency radios supporting up to 1000 watts of output power, critical to support the High Frequency radio links specified under the AUC3IS program requirements. USAFRICOM also intends to utilize CODAN's existing service support center network throughout Africa to reduce costs associated with in-country logistics and sustained support to this program. It is therefore critical to procure High Frequency radios fully interoperable with CODAN in order to fulfill USAFRICOM's African Union Command, Control, and Communications Information Systems (AUC3IS) mission to support present and future African Union peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>Installation of CODAN equipment by non-CODAN certified installers will void the warranties of existing equipment, thereby causing unacceptable delays and additional costs to the African Union and USG when maintenance is required. Therefore, certified CODAN installers are required to fulfill equipment warranty validation (three years on manufacturing, design and/ or component defects).<br /><br />6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES: This J&amp;A will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: The anticipated cost to the US Government will be determined fair and reasonable prior to award.</p>
<p><br />8. MARKET RESEARCH: The US Africa Command performed a market survey of exportable military-grade High Frequency radios, the manufacturers, their country of origin, and the available encryption options. Due to the austere operating environment, the radios must be military-grade and resistant to extreme temperatures, humidity, corrosion, dust, and contact with direct sunlight. In order to securely interoperate with the existing Harris high frequency radios owned and operated by the African Union, the radios must feature AES 256-bit encryption or Citadel encryption. In order to be exported to the African Union (ITAR exempt), these radios must not originate from the United States. Based on link modeling and analysis performed independently by CODAN and Harris, these radios must utilize the entire High Frequency spectrum (3 to 30 Mhz) and have the capability to be connected to a high-power amplifier (400W minimum) to ensure reliable, continuous operation between sites over challenging terrain. These radios also cannot be designated AN/PRC or PSC (Army-Navy portable radio component/portable secure radio component) equipment, as these designations connote restrictions on whom can purchase the equipment (usually only US military and allies). Entities such as the African Union and the regional economic centers are not military organizations or US allies. Based on the constraints above, CODAN is the sole High Frequency radio manufacturer that can provide a solution which will interoperate with the existing African Union High Frequency radio network. All other surveyed manufacturers were either restricted by ITAR, encryption type, or output power, and do not meet the established requirements.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: All CODAN equipment and installers must certify that they are CODAN certified as of the date of the submission of their offer and that all certifications/ specializations required as defined by CODAN to support the product sale, support and product pricing, have been met.</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF INTERESTED SOURCES:</p>
<p>a. CODAN US CORP</p>
<p>b. Harris Corporation</p>
<p>11. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: USAFRICOM fully supports competition among vendors and brands. Although this document is for a sole source item, all future requirements will be competed to the extent possible.</p>
<p>12. REFERENCE TO THE APPROVED ACQUISITION PLAN (AP) PROGRAM PLAN (PP):</p>
<p>The Department of State (DoS) provided USAFRICOM with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between DoS and USAFRICOM for the implementation.
