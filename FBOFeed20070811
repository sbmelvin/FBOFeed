SCOPE OF WORK/TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR PLANTING HARDWOOD SEEDLINGS I.	General A.	Current contract work will include hand planting of bottomland hardwood seedlings (approximately  232,203 ), furnished by the contractor, on approximately   679.1  acres, plus or minus 100 acres in Arkansas. B.	All work will be coordinated and supervised by a designated representative of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and shall meet or exceed forest industry standards for reforestation of hardwood seedlings. C.	The contractor shall be responsible for providing all supplies, materials, equipment, and personnel required to fulfill the terms of this contract. D.	Planting to begin no earlier than Dec. 1, 2007.  Once initiated, all work shall be completed within a one to two month period, weather and ground conditions permitting. All work should be completed no later than March 15, 2008. Any exceptions must be agreed upon by both parties in advance of the cutoff date. II.	Technical Specifications for Tree Establishment Planting stock will be delivered by the contractor on the day the planting operation is to begin. The contractor will be responsible for seedling care.  Extreme care shall be exercised to insure that seedlings are kept moist and cool (especially during storage) at all times prior to and during planting. A.	Machine or hand-planted with a dibble bar (10 inches long), planting will be done under optimum conditions. Soil moisture will be adequate for seedling survival.  Planting will be avoided during freezing conditions and in frozen ground. Seedlings will be planted from December 1 through March 15. Hardwood seedlings will be planted on a proven and acceptable spacing which will yield an approximate density of 302 seedlings per acre. They will be planted using approximately 12' X 12' spacing as a guide to direct the planting unless otherwise directed by Service personnel.  Planted seedling density and spacing will be determined by a Service representative and will not drop more than 5% below that required rate. Seedlings will be kept moist during the planting process.  Planting bags or similar devices are required for all planters.  All seedlings will be carried in planting bags prior to and during planting operations to protect the seedlings.  Every effort should be made to remove only one seedling from the planting bag at a time.  The contractor is to exercise care in separating and handling trees to avoid stripping or damaging roots.  Only the number of seedlings that can be placed in and removed from the planting bags without injury to seedlings will be carried by planting personnel. Only bald cypress, swamp tupelo gum, overcup oak, bitter pecan or green ash seedlings may be planted in standing water.  These species will only be planted in water less than 6 inches in depth.  No other species will be planted in temporarily ponded water greater than 2 inches in depth. B.  	A minimum of 85% of the trees planted must meet the following planting specifications: 1) Hardwood seedlings will have a top length of at least 18 inches; 2)The diameter of the root collar (the part of the root just below ground level) will be at least 3/8 inch in diameter; 3) Hardwood seedlings will be planted with the root collar slightly below ground level (1-2 inches); and 4) Planting bars must be at least 10 inches long to prevent shallow planting depths. C.	Roots will be inserted in planting opening straight. They will not be twisted, balled, L, J, or U-shaped.  Lateral roots will not be pruned unless approval is given by the Service representative. The minimum root length below the root collar will be 8 inches and the minimum number of first order lateral roots will equal 5.  Exceptions will be made for pecan.  B.	All plantings will be done with special attention given to proper soil compaction. Soil will be packed firmly around the planted seedlings with no air pockets left around the roots in the dibble holes. C.	Seedlings will either be planted or placed in cold storage as soon as possible after being lifted from the nursery bed.  Baled or sealed bags of seedlings may be stored for 2-3 weeks provided they are; 1) Stored in refrigerated units with temperatures between 34 and 40 degrees F. and relative humidity of 90% or greater; 2) Stored temporarily in an unheated building in a shady place and stacked on racks to ensure air circulation around the bales to prevent overheating for access of watering and properly sloped for drainage; and 3) Watered at least once a week to keep roots and packing moist. No planting will be done when air or soil temperatures fall below 32 degrees F. or rise above 70 degrees F.  Exceptions will be made when air temperatures drop to as low as 28 degrees but will rise to 32 degrees within 2 hours. No exceptions will be made when air temperatures drop below 28 degrees F. D.	Bagged seedlings will adhere to the following restrictions:  1) Bagged seedlings will not be exposed to direct sunlight; 2) Will not be allowed to freeze; 3) Will be transported under cool, shaded, ventilated conditions; 4) Bags will not be punctured or torn; 5) Damaged bags will be mended immediately with tape; 6) Seedlings will not be watered in sealing bags; and 7) Keep partially filled bags tightly closed at all times. E.	Loose seedlings will be Aheeled in@ immediately.  Steps to follow are: 1)  Select a well drained and slightly sloping spot. 2)  Dig a trench 2-4 inches deeper than the length of the seedling roots. 3)  Place a layer of seedlings along the sloping side of the trench and         cover the roots and 1-2 inches of the stems with soil. H.	Seedling care during planting operations: 1)  Seedlings will be kept covered, cool, and protected from sun and          wind. 2)  Seedling roots will be kept moist.  3)  At the end of the day, loose seedlings will be Aheeled in@ or                   repacked in wet peat moss and wrapped tightly with waterproof            paper. I.	Seedlings shall be protected from contamination by materials such as gasoline, diesel fuel, oils or chemicals which may damage the seedlings. J.	Each acre planted shall contain a mixture of seedlings in the proper proportion for each designated area.  Any planting sequence may be used to achieve an overall random mixture of seedlings (in the above proportions) on each acre planted.  A preferred seedling mixture list will be provided by the Service for each planting site and a final species list will be agreed upon before planting begins. K.	Before final acceptance, all structures, equipment and debris resulting from the contractor=s operation shall be removed from the work sites prior to payment. L.	The contractor shall protect property such as roads, levees, fences, power lines, water control structures, ditches and other private property against unnecessary damage and shall repair said damages immediately.  The contractor shall restore damages to the condition found prior to damage. III.	Inspection and Acceptance A.

D.	Final payment will not be made until all planting operations are completed and determination of the quality of the work is deemed acceptable. E.	Payment will be made for the actual number of acres satisfactorily planted. IV.	Liability The contractor agrees to forever hold harmless the United States, its officers, agents, employees, contractors and/or assigns from any and all damages to property or injuries to persons which may arise or be incident to the activities associated with this contract.

<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Executive Information Systems (EIS), 6901 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20827 to purchase developed software specifically for the purpose of adverse event signal detection.  The software is called WebVDME and in its earliest versions was developed with input from CDC researchers.  The Government believes that EIS consultants have specialized knowledge not only of the SAS Enterprise Miner software application but are also very familiar with the very complex DMSS database and its specialized data handling and data extraction requirements from their earlier work with VAU/CDC.  Consequently, it is believed that the EIS is the sole source Contractor having the capabilities which will meet the Governments requirements.  It is the intent of CDC to award a contract to EIS if this is found to be true.  This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302(a)(2) Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT. THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE NOTICE PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1.  THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE. NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), Southeast Inspection Office, has a requirement to provide voluntary seafood inspection services in the State of Louisiana for the U.S. Department of Commerce Seafood Inspection Program. The Program is not subsidized by appropriated funding. It relies entirely on fee-for-service income to fund its operating costs.  Under authorities established by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 USC 1621-1627), and the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, as amended (16 USC 742a-742k), NMFS is responsible for (1) the development and advancement of commercial grade standards for fishery products and better health and sanitation standards in the industry and (2) furnishing inspection and grading services and issuing certificates to producers, processors, shippers, receivers, or interested parties.  As defined by 50 CFR 260.6, the ?inspection services? performed under the Program include: sampling; determination of essential characteristics of or class, quality, and condition of any processed product; issuance of any certificate of sampling, inspection certificates, or certificates of loading a processed product, or any report relative thereto; or performance of any related services. An ?inspector? is any employee of the Department authorized by the Secretary of Commerce or any other person licensed by the Secretary. According to 50 CFR 260.49, inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the Secretary of Commerce who are employed as federal government employees for that purpose. However, any person employed under any joint federal-state inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, by the Secretary of Commerce. Additional information about the Program can be found at http://seafood.nmfs.noaa.gov.  Pursuant to the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 3, Section 412, the State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF) is exclusively responsible for the inspection, grading, and certification of fresh and saltwater fishery products in the State of Louisiana.  Accordingly, NMFS intends to solicit and negotiate a contract only with the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF), P.O. Box 1951, Baton Rouge, LA, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by 48 CFR 6.302-1. The period of performance is for a base period from October 1, 2007 through February 28, 2008 with four (4) twelve (12)-month option periods. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties should reference No. NFFKA520-7-00001PY and send their capability statement with evidence of licensing and ability to provide the required services stated above. All proposals received within 30 days after the date of publication of this synopsis may be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to restrict competition for this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The applicable NAICS code is 541990.     Firms having questions regarding the requirement may contact Ted Mackey at Edward.H.Mackey@noaa.gov or (816) 426-2068 Patsy Ybarra at Patsy.A.Ybarra@noaa.gov. The firms may also send the capability information to these email addresses. All contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) in order to do business with the Government. Instructions for registering may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all bidders must have a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) number.

<DESC>SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), Southeast Inspection Office, has a requirement to provide cross-utilization inspection services.  In accordance with CFR 260.1, the Secretary of Commerce is charged with the administration of regulations in this part except that he may delegate any or all of such functions to any officer or employee of the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department in his discretion.  The NMFS is responsible for: (1) the development and advancement of commercial grade standards for fishery products and better health and sanitation standards in the industry; and (2) furnishing inspection and grading services and issuing certificates to producers, processors, shippers, receivers or interested parties.  In addition, CFR 260.49 Inspectors, states, “Inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the Secretary who are employed as federal Government employees for that purpose.  However, any person employed under any joint Federal-State inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, by the Secretary to make inspections in accordance with this part on such processed products as may be specified in his license.  Such license shall be issued only in a case where the Secretary is satisfied that the particular person is qualified to perform adequately the inspection service for which such person is to be licensed.”  The NMFS’ major purpose is to encourage and assist the industry in improving the quality and safety of its products, and to provide objective information by means of inspection and official certification concerning the class, quality, quantity, identity and condition of products which will be of maximum assistance to interested parties engaged in the production, processing, and marketing of fish and fishery products.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The source is the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, P.O. Box 1951, Baton Rouge, LA.  The State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Department of Agriculture (LDAF) under the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 3, Section 412, is responsible for the inspection, grading and certification of fresh and saltwater fishery products in the State of Louisiana.  The LDAF is responsible for inspecting and grading fish and fishery products purchased by the State for use by State institutions and for inspecting and grading fish and fishery products purchased by and for local school systems.  The period of performance is for a base period from March 1, 2007 through February 28, 2008 with four (4) twelve (12)-month option periods.  The cooperative agreement between the USDOC, NMFS and the State of Louisiana includes a federal/state cross licensing agreement.  The work to be performed under this contract is an inherently federal function mandated by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.  50 CFR 260.49 limits performance of this type of work to either federal or state employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties should reference No. NFFKA520-7-00001PY and send their capability statement with evidence of licensing and ability to provide the required services stated above.  All proposals received within 30 days after the date of publication of this synopsis may be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government to restrict competition for this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.    Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 114119.  Firms having questions regarding the requirement and the authority cited under 50 CFR 260.49 may contact Ted Mackey at Edward.H.Mackey@noaa.gov or (816) 426-2068 Patsy Ybarra at Patsy.A.Ybarra@noaa.gov.
