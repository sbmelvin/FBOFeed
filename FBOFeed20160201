<DESC><strong>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.</strong> This RFI is ISSUED for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect cost or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The 82d Communications Squadron (82 CS) and the 82d Contracting Squadron (82 CONS) at Sheppard Air Force Base are developing strategies for the design and installation of an IPTV-based television system. The system will provide television access for up to 10,000 users. 82 CS and 82 CONS are conducting market research into options available from IPTV suppliers/manufacturers to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The objective of this system is to provide a single "point-of-entry" for television service and provide television channels to users throughout the base, via a method alternative to traditional cable television delivery methods. Cable television via coaxial distribution is the current primary means of providing television service to base users.</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The vision for an IPTV system for Sheppard Air Force Base is to provide between 4 to 8 television channels for up to 10,000 users. The goal for this system is to provide an alternative to traditional cable television delivery methods by utilizing a single "point-of-entry" as a source of television service. Users will have the capability to view provided channels on networked computers via software, or set-top boxes for television viewing.</strong><br />&emsp;<br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) intends to use the information obtained via this RFI to potentially construct a follow-on Request for Quote (RFQ) should this information solidify into an executable program to install an IPTV system. There is no guarantee that the RFI or any associated RFQ will result in a contract award. The USAF will consider all possible procurement options arising from this effort including single awards, multiple awards, and small business set-asides.</p>
<p>In order to begin formulating an acquisition strategy for the follow-on contract(s), the USAF intends to use the information gathered from this effort to begin to assess capabilities and interest to provide an IPTV system to meet the described requirements. <strong>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the described requirements listed in the attached document. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. See attached document for information regarding submissions.</strong></p>

<DESC>The Air Force Material Command, Air Force Test Center, Strategic Services Management Office (AFTC/PZZB), Eglin AFB, Florida, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract modification under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Indyne Inc., 11800 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite 250, Reston VA. 20191-5300 for Eglin Test and Training Complex O&amp;M Support.
<p>The government has a requirement for the engineering and technical services necessary to operate and maintain the 96 Test Wing ETTC mission in order to support the research, development, test and evaluation of weapon systems, subsystems, and components. These engineering and technical services operate and maintain software and hardware that support every major military weapon system development program and every fielded system improvement. The services provide for such activities as test management, test data analysis, technology development, capital improvements, test operations, test facility maintenance, management and engineering services, purchasing, quality management, information protection, financial management, integrated scheduling, property administration, and utility system sustainment engineering support. Under the contemplated modification, lndyne Inc. will continue the scope of work that is currently provided under the ETTC contract.</p>
<p>The Government is presently holding a competition for the successor contract to the ETTC contract. This successor contract, entitled Eglin Operations and Maintenance Services (EOMS), has a six month transition period (1 April 2016 thru 30 September 2016), with full performance beginning 1 October 2016. In order to ensure operational continuity during the transition period, full performance under the ETTC contract must overlap the entire EOMS contract's transition period. Essentially, this modification is a "bridge" effort until the follow on contract is awarded and full performance can begin. The only known responsible source that can satisfy this requirement is Indyne Incorporated because it possesses the knowledge, experience, manpower, enhanced security clearances, and infrastructure already in place to continue operational continuity for mission critical test and training support. This contract modification is anticipated to have a period of performance of no more than 12 months, consisting of a base period of 6 months (1 April 2016 thru 30 September 2016) and 6 one month options (1 October 2016 thru 31 March 2017). The estimated cost for this modification will be $85M. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Any submission will need to demonstrate how the source can provide qualified capabilities beginning NLT 1 April 2016 without incurring substantial duplication of costs or unacceptable delays to the Eglin Test and Training Complex O &amp; M activities. NOTE: A Sources Sought Synopsis and RFI requesting submissions was previously posted on FedBizOpps on November 5, 2015 (reference Solicitation# ETTC-FA9200-TBD16).</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed in accordance with AFFARS 5352.201-9101. Before consulting with the Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723-6099 for an effort entitled "Bremsstrahlung-Based Active Interrogation - Photon Active Search System (BBAI-PASS) Analysis." The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1).
<p>JHU/APL is the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The documentation and analysis of the BBAI-PASS program is currently being performed by JHU/APL under an ongoing DTRA contract. JHU/APL has exclusive knowledge about the BBAI-PASS program and history from thoroughly researching and collecting information, to include personal interviews, on the BBAI-PASS program since inception. JHU/APL has unique experience with PASS and its operation, limitations and capabilities because they attended the PASS experiments, collected data while on-site, and continues to work with the lead laboratory that conducted the experiments in analysis of the PASS performance.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to analyze the current and future BBAI-PASS experimentation data and modeling provided by the lead laboratory to support military utility determination and fully document the BBAI-PASS effort.</p>
<p>This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>Requisition No. 1158742<br />NAICS Code: 511120</p>
<p>Informa Business Information, Inc.<br />1 Research Drive, Suite 400A<br />Westborough, MA 01581-3988</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions &amp; Grants Services (OAGS), intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis to INFORMA BUSINESS INFORMATION, INC. (INFORMA), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. INFORMA will host four (4) Regulatory Education for Industry (REdI) conferences and one webinar yearly. This service will be negotiated and awarded for a base period of performance with three (3) option periods of performance.</p>
<p>The advertisements for the conferences and seminars shall be conveyed via Pink Sheet and Scrip publications. The conferences will be held in the Months of April, May, July, and September. The webinars will be held in the Month of June. The service is to support the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Small Business and Industry Assistance's (SBIA) Regulatory Education of Industry (REdI) in promoting the events.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to maximize attendance at the events, both domestically and internationally. CDER SBIA's target audience is the global pharmaceutical industry. These events allow the FDA to interact directly with the pharmaceutical industry who can then express their concerns, questions and suggestions on FDA's regulatory procedures. This forum also creates a healthy environment in which pharma feels safe to discuss their ideas with the FDA experts. These interactions will also inform the future actions/decisions of the various programs which are represented by the presenters who are all subject matter experts within their fields. The feedback assists the CDER SBIA program in gauging the needs of the pharmaceutical industry and customizing our outreach activities (web information, educational modules, webinars, newsletter, etc.) to meet those needs. <br />Given the high readership of the Pink Sheet and Scrip publications, INFORMA, is uniquely positioned to provide news and information to the biopharma and medical device professionals, both domestically (Pink Sheet) and internationally (Scrip). No other organization in the industry can provide the global presence required to promote the Forum. <br />A determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable will be made in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. Interested parties may identify in writing their interest and capability to respond. Responses must be received by no later than 4:30 PM, Eastern Time, Tuesday, February 16, 2016. If the FDA identifies no other capable sources by that day and time, a Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order will be issued to INFORMA BUSINESS INFORMATION, INC.<br /><br />Any inquiries should be directed to Anthony S. Wimbush at 5630 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, Room 2103, or via e-mail at anthony.wimbush@fda.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>Posted February 1, 2016</p>

<SOLNBR>SOL-CI-16-00007
<CONTACT>Charlton, Candice
<DESC>The US EPA, Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD), has a need for contractor services for a variety of technical analyses and support activities such as services for various analyses, modeling, and other activities associated with the development of regulations for mobile source emissions.

It is anticipated that any future contract for these services will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Level-of-Effort (LOE) type contract with five (5) one-year periods, each with LOE of approximately 128,000 hours. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services) with a size standard of $15 million.  The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary personnel, equipment, and services necessary to conduct the research activities delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

The technical and scientific services to be provided under this contract will support the Agency in its development of regulations for motor vehicle, aircraft, marine vessel, locomotive, and non-road equipment manufacturers; engine manufacturers; and producers and distributors of fuel/fuel additives.  It is considered to be in the best interest of the Government to exclude from award as a prime contractor or subcontractor those entities that are directly engaged in or that have a business, financial, or competitive relationship(s) with firms that are motor vehicle, aircraft, marine vessel, locomotive, or non-road equipment manufacturers; engine manufacturers; or that produce or distribute fuel or fuel additives.  In addition, the Agency has determined that offerors that work directly for or that provide consulting or technical services to motor vehicle, aircraft, marine vessel, locomotive, and non-road equipment manufacturers;  engine manufacturers; or that produce or distribute fuel or fuel additives may also have significant actual or potential OCOI concerns.  Therefore, all offerors will be required to submit an OCOI plan identifying the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual OCOI can be mitigated, avoided, or neutralized.  In order to be considered for award, a determination must be made that the proposed plan adequately protects the Governments interest.

All offerors shall submit an OCOI plan that describes procedures the offeror uses to identify and report COIs. The solicitation shall include standard EPAAR provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) which require that an offeror certify whether it is aware of any potential OCOI or disclose any potential OCOI, and provide disclosure statements describing such OCOI, which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the PWS. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest that is discovered or arises after contract award shall also be part of the solicitation. Furthermore, the EPAAR clause (EPAAR 1552.209-74, Alternate V, Limitation of Future Contracting) shall also be included in the solicitation and prohibits the contractor, without the approval of the Contracting Officer, from entering into contracts with an individual, organizations, or their consultants, to provide services on or in support of the specific remediation equipment, technology, or process identified in a work assignment.  This restriction applies during the life of the contract.

A draft PWS detailing the required tasks for this FBO procurement announcement is posted as an attachment on the FedConnect web portal. Notices of any modifications to this FBO procurement announcement, including Requests for Proposals and amendments, will be posted using the FedConnect web portal.  FedConnect can be accessed at https://www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/. Questions regarding the content of the subject announcement must be submitted through the FedConnect portal.

<SUBJECT>Mud Mountain Dam 9-Foot Tunnel Rearmoring
<SOLNBR>W912DW-16-R-0006
<ARCHDATE>02292016
<CONTACT>Joy Blair, Phone 206-764-6952, Email joy.blair@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This is a PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2. No response is required. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, intends to issue a formal solicitation for Rearmoring of the Mud Mountain Dam 9-Foot Tunnel in Enumclaw, WA. The successful offeror will be responsible for a complete design and construction of the new steel floor armoring. Offerors are advised that full project funding is currently unavailable, and as such this project may be delayed or cancelled at any time prior to contract award.
<p><br />The proposed solicitation will use the best-value with tradeoff process, where all factors when combined are significantly more important than price. Offerors are cautioned that award may not be made to the lowest-priced offeror. This will be a Two-Phase, Design-Build project with Phase I being issued approximately 20 February 2016.<br /><br />The Phase I solicitation will include a draft copy of the Statement of Work and may include a partial design. Under Phase I, evaluation factors may consist of Technical Capabilities, Key Personnel/Organization, and Past Performance. The Government will select between three (3) and six (6) of the most highly-rated offerors to submit proposals for Phase II.<br /><br />Based on the results of market research conducted the proposed solicitation will be unrestricted, with a magnitude of construction between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The contract duration is currently estimated at 1095 days, which includes a one-year warranty period.</p>
<p>A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract is anticipated under NAICS Code 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Mud Mountain Dam is a flood control dam situated on the White River in Western Washington State. Downstream of Mud Mountain Dam, the White River enters the greater Tacoma metropolitan area which is a densely populated area in Western Washington State requiring protection from potential floods.</p>
<p>Mud Mountain Dam was designed taking into consideration significant silt and rock bed loads. Two tunnels were constructed: a partially armored 9-foot tunnel to pass water with bed load, and a largely unarmored 23-foot tunnel to pass primarily water. Access to the 9-foot tunnel is primarily through the tunnel outlet, via a steep, gravel road on the downstream face of the dam.<br /><br />The existing 9-foot tunnel is a 9-foot diameter, 1800-foot horseshoe shaped tunnel. The entire tunnel has a concrete liner. Because of the high bed load passed through the tunnel, 1" thick steel floor armoring was installed over the concrete liner. As a result of damage from abrasion, holes have formed in the current steel armoring the 9-foot tunnel. Additionally, some of the existing floor may need limited repair.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF WORK:</p>
<p>Floor armoring is required to replace the existing, and any voids beneath the new plates will require a scan to verify the extent of damage and grouting/repair required. Formulation, design, and construction of new steel armoring is required to rehabilitate and maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The tunnel is damp and constrictive, approximately 9-ft wide and 8-ft tall (from existing floor to crown). Staging near the tunnel outlet may be limited, and construction scheduling will require phasing due to current dam operations.</p>
<p>A site visit will be held during the Phase I solicitation period. Please contact the primary POC&nbsp;for questions regarding this requirement.</p>

<p>The estimated cost range of this project is between $750,000 and $1,500,000. Bid, Performance and Payment Bonds will be required.</p>
<p>The Congress in authorizing and funding this project has established certain funding limitations for the project. No award can be made for the design and construction of this project if the total price exceeds this statutory funding limitation. Proposals whose price for design and construction exceed the funds available may be rejected. The construction funding limitation will be provided in the Solicitation.</p>
<p>Solicitation packages will be available on or about 16 FEB 2016. The tentative date set for receipt of proposals is scheduled for 16 MAR 2016 by 2:00 pm.

The overall performance period for this project is 365 calendar days (Design Phase NTE 90 calendar days) after contract award.</p>
<p>This procurement is being solicited using the Two Phase Solicitation Process authorized by FAR 36.3. This process requires Phase I offerors to submit their past performance, basic technical approach, and capability information initially for review and consideration by the Government.

Phase II offerors shall provide a technical and cost proposal for consideration by the Government. Bid guarantees will be required at Phase II. The Government will review the technical and price proposals of the Phase II offerors.

Contractor will have exclusive rights to sell all food, beverage and novelty items during the event, subject to the stipulations set forth in this document.</p>
<p>2. Air Force Open House (Air Show) events are designed to inform the public about capabilities, equipment, training, and professionalism of the Air Force and its people.

Open houses will not be used as a venue for the display or sale of commercial items, other than those provided for in this proposal.</p>
<p>3. Contractor must have the ability to provide sufficient concession tents/booths to meet the high volume demands of the open house crowds and provide sufficient management personnel to effectively oversee all booth concession operations, collect excess cash for bank deposits, trash collections and cleanup within the concession booths.

Applicability of appropriate disclaimer will be ensured by the NAFI. Contractor pricing on all food, beverages, merchandise, and novelty items will be consistent with those charged at comparable military open houses.</p>
<p>9. Contractor shall provide all training to volunteers for performing their assigned duties, unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer. All training classes will be coordinated through the NAFI.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL NOTES.</p>
<p>17. Access and location/placement options for vendor booths that sell concession or souvenir type items are determined only with the coordination and/or approval of the air show coordinator, NAF Contracting Officer, and/or Force Support Squadron representatives to the air show committee. If the entire OHAS concessions are contracted to a commercial concern (minus the sale of alcohol), the contractor's recommendations will be considered and evaluated fairly by the air show committee. Concession contractors will not promise access or specific booth/display placement locations to any vendor unless booth/display placement decisions have been approved in advance by the air show committee.</p>
<p>18. NAF concession contracts cannot include access for any civilian aerial demonstrations act or team or booth display benefits for aerial act underwriters. All civilian aerial demonstration offers/issues must be coordinated with the installation commander or higher authority and processed as a donation IAW applicable AFIs when appropriate. When aerial act underwriters seek recognition that is provided only to commercial sponsors under the AF Commercial Sponsorship Program, they must negotiate a separate sponsorship agreement with the Force Support Squadron.</p>
<p>19. All issues involving access or booth location on the ramp for sponsor booths/displays, concessionaire contractor booths, NFO/NFE provided vendors, or other Private Organization operated booths will be coordinated and resolved by the Force Support Squadron Marketing/Sponsorship POC in conjunction with the air show committee. <br /><br /><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR PRODUCTION OF JOINT MUNITIONS EFFECTIVENESS MANUALS (JMEMs)</strong> <br /><strong><br />SYNOPSIS</strong> <br /><br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - Operational Weaponeering and Analysis Division (AFLCMC/EZW) at Eglin Air Force Base is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statements from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), and Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small business, for the production of the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) custom developed software systems and conventional weapons effectiveness and target vulnerability data products. These products are produced for and accredited by the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME), which is a tri-service organization consisting of Army, Navy and Air Force membership. The primary responsibility of the JTCG/ME is to provide Operational Commanders, Department of Defense (DoD) Weaponeers and Targeteers, Mission Planners, Weapon System Designers, and Logisticians with realistic modeling and simulation tools, as well as accurate weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability data. The JMEM software systems and data products are used to support Joint and individual (Army, Air Force, and Navy) operational command centers and weapon development programs, as well as multiple DoD advanced research projects and munitions purchasing requirements. <br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) are asked to provide a statement of information describing the software development and technical capabilities they can provide to address the technical, key competency and program execution requirements described in later sections of this notice. Please do not provide standard marketing brochures or catalogs. The response should clearly explain the respondent's demonstrated software and systems engineering knowledge, scientific and technical capabilities, and program management expertise in executing DoD contracts. The Government will use the responses to identify potential sources, facilitate decision making, and further develop the acquisition strategy for the JMEMs production contract.
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to perform this effort to the primary points of contact listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The anticipated NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a size standard of 500 persons.

Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14. Finally, in the event respondents do not agree with the anticipated NAICS Code, the Government requests respondents provide a suggested NAICS Codes with responses.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>The Government requests that interested parties submit an electronic response of not more than fifteen (15) pages, 8.5" x 11" paper, 12 pitch, Times New Roman font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around.

<p><strong>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The first key technical requirement for the JMEMs production contract is software development to enhance, modify, and sustain existing custom software systems consisting of engagement level modeling and simulation components. The JMEMs custom software systems are used to determine weaponeering results for multiple conventional weapon systems and platforms against multiple target types, and are also used to determine a quantitative operational evaluation of air combat tactics, missile intercept probability, and aircrew performance. Weaponeering results consist of but are not limited to probability of damage estimates considering target vulnerability, weapon effects, munition delivery errors, user defined damage criteria, weapon reliability, and terrain effects. <br />The second key technical requirement for the JMEMs production contract is to assist the Government in the analysis, production, utilization and publication of weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability data products. JMEMs weapon effectiveness data includes system characteristic and performance data for multiple air-to-surface, air-to-air, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface weapons, direct and indirect fire weapons guided and unguided weapon systems; these systems includes but are not limited to missiles, rockets, bombs, artillery, mortars, small caliber guns, naval gun systems, tank rounds, as well as non-kinetic and offensive cyber effects capabilities. JMEM target vulnerability data includes, but is not limited to; target models consisting of personnel, fixed and rotary winged aircraft, ships, armored and un-armored military vehicles, land based equipment and weapon systems, as well as infrastructure elements such as bridges, underground bunkers and tunnels, and above-ground buildings.<br /><br /><strong>KEY COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />The scientific emphasis of the JMEMs software and data products requires advanced education, knowledge and skill in Advanced Mathematics, Physics and Engineering as well as recent and relevant expertise in modeling and analysis of damage effects from multiple types of kinetic and thermobaric weapons against personnel, military and commercial vehicles and equipment, hardened and non-hardened structural targets. The specific key competencies required to accomplish the scientific emphasis of the JMEMs products includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Software and Systems Engineering<br />&bull; Relational Database Design and Administration<br />&bull; Computer Networking and Information Technology<br />&bull; Blast Propagation <br />&bull; Warhead Penetration and Fragmentation<br />&bull; Weapon Trajectory (3DOF and 6DOF Modeling)<br />&bull; Weapon Cratering and Ground Shock Propagation<br />&bull; Materials Science - Properties and Response of Solids<br />&bull; 3-D Structural Modeling and Structural Response<br />&bull; Personnel and Equipment Vulnerability<br />&bull; Design of Experiments (DoE)<br />&bull; Finite Element (FE) and Statistical Analysis.</p>
<p>An additional critical part of the JMEMs production contract is the training of active duty weaponeers and targeteers in the JMEM software products; therefore, additional areas of specialized knowledge, skill and experience in the area of training are also required. The key competencies associated with training include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of DoD Operational Command center functions<br />&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of Standard Operating Procedures for Weaponeering, Targeteering and Mission Planning<br />&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of Collateral Damage Methodology and Estimation<br />&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of Target Material Production in support of deliberate and dynamic targeting process<br />&bull; Military experience and/or Knowledge of Joint Publications/Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions associated with Weaponeering, Targeteering, Collateral Damage and Coordinate Mensuration<br />&bull; Lesson planning and Training Documentation Development.</p>
<p>Software development tasks for the JMEMs production contract will require a demonstrated proficiency in the design, implementation and verification of engineering and engagement level modeling and simulation software. The key software development competencies include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) <br />&bull; Software Design Patterns<br />&bull; User Interface Design<br />&bull; Application Program Interface (API) Design<br />&bull; Modern Software Framework/Architecture<br />&bull; 3D Graphics Rendering and Imagery Replication <br />&bull; Software Documentation and Unified Modeling Language (UML)<br />&bull; HTML, XML, C, C++, C#, FORTRAN, JAVA<br />&bull; Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library<br />&bull; Relational Database Design and Administration and SQL<br />&bull; Cybersecurity, namely the safe storage and network dissemination of classified data, in particular the DoD Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework v1.0 dated September 2015.<br />&bull; Computer Network Communication Protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, SOAP)</p>
<p>Systems and Software Engineering Processes are also considered a critical knowledge area required for the JMEM production contract. Respondents to this notice shall provide examples that demonstrate experience in the implementation of Systems and Software Engineering processes which are equivalent to Maturity Level 3 in the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Staged Representation for Systems and Software Engineering. Additionally, each respondent to this notice must possess key competencies in the following Software Development areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Software Design, Analysis and Documentation<br />&bull; Software Project Planning and Integrated Project Management<br />&bull; Requirements Management and Development<br />&bull; Configuration Management <br />&bull; Verification (Software Test to include unit, integration, and system level verification, as well dynamic and static forms of software test)<br />&bull; Validation<br />&bull; Software Quality Assurance and Metrics Evaluation<br />&bull; Product Integration<br />&bull; Technical Solution<br />&bull; Risk Management<br />&bull; Effort and Cost Estimation<br />&bull; Decision Analysis and Resolution<br />&bull; Organizational Process Focus, Definition and Training</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The JMEMs software systems and data operate and are distributed on Government classified networks; therefore JMEMs production will require an expert level of knowledge related to the application of Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) requirements for obtaining authority to operate, as well as DoD guidance for classification marking and foreign releasability. Additionally, security clearances will be required of all personnel working on JMEMs products.</p>
<p>Production of JMEMs software and data products may be performed across geographically separated contractor facilities. However, the majority of development and production of JMEMs software products must be performed in a Government owned facility located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Additional contractor support and subject matter expertise in the area of direct fire weapons and air combat tactics and maneuvers will be required at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Each respondent to this notice should be capable of recruiting and retaining top quality employees at each of the Government facility locations mentioned above.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources on behalf of Communications-Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD) for Engineering Support and Modeling &amp; Simulation of Sensors Applications in support of DoD and US Intelligence agency services to support advanced modeling and simulation for aerial and ground intelligence collection sensors simulations in support of sustainment training and new equipment training.<br /><br />Support is needed for advanced, physics-based sensor simulation technology development for Electro Optic Infra-Red (EO/IR all spectrums), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and multi intelligence collection systems that are developed or in development. Advanced development of tactics techniques and procedures (TTP), systems analysis, system test and evaluation, system modeling and simulation, as well as sustainment and new equipment training in the focus areas of Sensors and Sensor Systems platforms for aerial and ground intelligence collection systems. The Contractor will be required to have a TOP Secret facility clearance and TOP Secret safeguarding requirements.
<p>The services and support described herein are intended to maximize the operational capability and efficiency of NVESD by providing personnel with the necessary skill levels and expertise to support the Government in conducting research, development and administrative efforts related to modeling and simulation of sensors. The services and support described herein are not limited to the longer term research, development and administrative efforts but also include quick reaction support services and material directly related to NVESD efforts to provide rapid technology solutions to the Warfighters to address urgent current/future mission needs related to conflicts and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Assistance is needed for Modeling and Simulation Division developed Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) models in a live, virtual and constructive (LVC) simulation environment where these simulation applications are used to support sensor technology development, concept exploration, system integration, potential test and evaluation phase, production of releasable hardware, and planned support of sensor-based systems for the US Army and other DOD organizations. The use of these modeling and simulation applications provides a realistic approach to using future hardware in theatre. These simulation applications are expected to provide a close replication of human interaction, direct the development of engineering design alternatives, allow users to evaluate new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP), and participate in a virtual environment for Joint and Army LVC experiments as well as transition technologies and systems that show the most potential for enhancing the lethality and survivability capabilities of the Warfighter and wounded warriors. Additionally, sensor systems for future US Army and other Department of Defense (DOD) customers need to be engineered, a prototype constructed and tested and eventually expanded into a Program of Record needing oversight, systems engineering, logistical and sustainment support.</p>

<p>1.	Is an easily applied liquid (such as a paint, paste, or spray) at ambient temperature OR a highly flexible thin tape material</p>
<p>2.	Cures to a plastic coating at ambient environment on a timescale of minutes</p>
<p>3.	Is easily removed from a surface-by peeling, abrading, or rinsing with water</p>
<p>Materials of interest should be able to fulfill these criteria on porous surfaces, such as military grade textile fabrics. However, if the material has not been formulated or tested on porous surfaces, it is STILL OF INTEREST AT THE CURRENT TIME. We invite any companies that have temporary plastic coating materials, regardless of their normal use or surface compatibility, to reply to this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to identify potential business sources with the authority, capacity, and technical capability necessary to successfully provide Tablets that can be utilized to electronically supplement the present paper based elements of the immigration adjudication process.
<p>This notice is issued solely for the purpose of conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. No solicitation is being issued at this time and the Government makes no assertion that a solicitation will be issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government is not obligated to, and will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The US Citizenship and Immigrations Services (USCIS)/Office of Information Technology (OIT) seek to automate certain aspects of the paper based process through the use of tablets connected to the Electronic Immigration System (ELIS). Presently approximately 2,000Immigration Officers adjudicate the naturalization applications using multiple applications and paper. More specifically, changes in an applicant's application are printed during the interview, acknowledged with a signature, and scanned and uploaded into ELIS in order to maintain a wholly electronic application. With the deployment of tablets to the Immigration Officers, USCIS will be able to present changed content to applicants, capture the applicant's signature electronically, and the content and signature can be electronically associated with the original application, rendering the overall experience more efficient and effective.</p>

<CONTACT>eliana york , Phone 7036328067, Email eliana.york@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Government seeks potential sources capable of conducting a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to identify the basis for errors that arose from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Laboratory protocols, practices, and procedures concerning Microscopic Hair Comparison Analysis performed prior to December 31, 1999, when mitochondrial DNA testing on appropriate hair evidence was fully incorporated as standard operating procedure. The science of hair examinations is not the subject of this review. Specifically, the U.S. Government seeks assistance in determining how certain patterns developed that resulted in laboratory examiners providing statements in testimony and laboratory reports that exceeded the limits of the science of Microscopic Hair Comparison and these statements were repeated over a period of time. The U.S. Government requests information on potential sources' knowledge, skill, and experience in conducting RCAs of errors made by forensic laboratories through the examination of those laboratories' protocols, practices, training, testimony and other relevant materials. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes to serve as a market survey to aid in the development of a procurement strategy for an RCA report, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any services and no award is intended as a result of this request. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.
<p>The specifics are as follows:</p>
<p>The FBI Laboratory is a full-service operation, providing forensic exams, technical support, expert witness testimony, and advanced training to Bureau personnel and partners around the globe. The FBI Laboratory is dedicated to its mission and to using the rigors of science to protect and defend the nation. In order to ensure the correct application of forensic science to past and current cases involving forensic examination of hair, the Government seeks to identify companies that have the ability to perform a RCA of laboratory procedures and protocols relating to Microscopic Hair Comparison Analysis as they were historically conducted. Such a RCA investigation of past practices is essential to minimize the chance of recurring mistakes.</p>
<p>Respondents need to address their knowledge of, and/or ability to do, the following: <br />(1) Forensic laboratory management models. <br />(2) Perform investigative analysis on laboratory examination methodologies for Microscopic Hair Comparison Analysis as they were conducted prior to December 31, 1999. <br />(3) Perform investigative analysis on laboratory protocols for Microscopic Hair Comparison Analysis as they existed prior to December 31, 1999.<br />(4) Assess guidelines for, and training related to, presenting and explaining forensic analysis results as they related to Microscopic Hair Comparison Analysis prior to December 31, 1999 in testimony and laboratory reports. <br />(5) Interpret and review report formats and assess adherence to accepted scientific standards in Microscopic Hair Comparison Analysis prior to December 31, 1999.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a white paper not to exceed 15 pages in no smaller than 12 pt Times New Roman font. The white paper should include the following information: (1) tailored capability statements addressing the information requested above, and (2) any additional materials that are deemed appropriate by the respondent. Responses shall include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), and will be treated as information only.</p>
<p>All questions must reference RFI FY16-FBI-RFI-02-STCU02 and be submitted in writing no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday 29 February, 2016, to the contractual point of contact Mrs. Eliana York at eliana.york@ic.fbi.gov; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. Submittals must also include: Company name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and appropriate point of contact information. The U.S. Government requests that the respondents deliver one electronic copy in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF formal. Responses to this RFI may NOT be submitted via facsimile or hand delivered. Acknowledgement of receipt will only be issued if a return receipt is requested with the submission.</p>
<p>All information submitted shall be adequately safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR Part 15.207. The U.S. Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance its understanding of the respondent's submittal. Submissions that fail to comply with the above instructions or contain information that is not pertinent to the subject may not be reviewed. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified. Any exchange of information shall be consistent with procurement integrity requirements, and all appropriately marked proprietary information, if any, will be protected to prevent improper disclosure. All materials submitted will be kept by the FBI for market research purposes and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Remedial Action Contract (RAC) to determine interest, availability and capability of small businesses, including but not limited to 8(a) Small Business Development Program, HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned firms, to perform the work described below.
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE FOR SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST<br />FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE, SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATION OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROCUREMENT COMMITMENT BY THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. REPONSE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR OR SUFFER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY IMPROPERLY IDENTIFIED INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for the work described below is 562910. The total IDIQ RAC capacity will be $25,000,000. Task orders will be negotiated and awarded under the IDIQ based on a Request for Proposal (RFP) and specific Scope of Work (SOW) provided by the Federal Government after award of the base IDIQ. Work could begin in Fall 2016 and will extend over a 5 year period. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to receive a government contract. The website for registration is https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The contract will have the geographic boundaries of the North Atlantic Division mission area although the location of the majority of the work to be performed under this contract shall be specific to the Elizabeth Mine Superfund Site, South Strafford and Thetford, Vermont, and other project sites within New Hampshire and Vermont.</p>
<p>The Elizabeth Mine Superfund Site (Site) is an abandoned copper mine located on privately owned land in the Towns of Strafford and Thetford, Orange County, in east-central Vermont. It is located approximately two miles southeast of the village of South Strafford, on the eastern flank of Copperas Hill. The Site is approximately 15 miles northwest of White River Junction, Vermont, and 9 miles west of the Connecticut River. The Site includes three small watersheds containing Copperas Brook, Lord Brook, and Sargent Brook, which all discharge to the West Branch Ompompanoosuc River (WBOR). The Ompompanoosuc River flows into the Connecticut River about ten miles downstream of the Site. The topography of the area is steep mountainous terrain with elevations ranging from approximately 830 feet above mean sea level (MSL) (North American Vertical Datum [NAVD] 1988) adjacent to the WBOR, to 1600 feet above MSL at the top of Copperas Hill. The Elizabeth Mine was developed in open pits and in extensive underground workings. The mine area is a source of heavy metals and sediments to Lord Brook and Copperas Brook which carry the drainage from the mine and tailings deposits to the WBOR. Mine dumps and tailings from the Elizabeth Mine have been exposed both historically and currently to weathering processes that result in acid mine drainage (AMD) and acid rock drainage (ARD). Major sources of ARD included Tailing Pile 1 (TP-1, 30 acres), Tailing Pile 2 (TP-2, 5 acres), Tailing Pile 3 (TP-3, 6 acres) which consisted of a waste pile adjacent to the North Open Cut, and Tailing Pile 4 (TP-4) which consisted of a waste pile on the east side of Copperas Road adjacent to South Open Cut. A Non-time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA) was performed to consolidate and cap the tailing piles. Next steps at the Site include but are not limited to consolidation and capping of mining materials at the Lord Brook Source Areas, which comprise the South Mine, South Open Cut, and TP-4 to control the discharge of dissolved metals to the Lord Brook drainage area, and construction of a passive treatment system to replace the Water Treatment Plant at the North/WBOR end of the Site.</p>
<p>The work involves establishing safety zones and procedures near open cuts and mine inner workings, protection of existing environmental resources, pre-treatment of surface waters to raise pH, clearing of vegetation, temporary and permanent surface water diversions, dewatering of pit lakes and mine shafts, stabilization of open cuts through controlled blasting, crushing or blasting of large rock, excavation, relocation, consolidation and grading of rock, waste rock and tailing, application of shotcrete and/or flowable fill as necessary to fill voids, significant earthwork requiring appropriate erosion and sediment control best management practices (BMPs), installation of a permanent cover consisting of geogrid, geotextile, low permeability soil, filter fabric, common borrow, topsoil and seed, installation of limestone channels and check dams, construction of mitigation wetlands and passive treatment wetlands, implementation of historic preservation measures (e.g., portion of cuts left exposed), potential installation of horizontal drains and/or lined French drains to intercept flow and treat to meet surface water quality standards, monitoring of surface and groundwater, including monitoring well installation, to ensure effectiveness of the remedy, performance of site-wide inspection and maintenance including but not limited to caps, roads, wetlands, and invasive species, implementation of institutional controls, and operation of metals removal treatment system. All work will be performed in accordance with CERCLA, the EPA Action Memoranda signed in September 2002 and March 2004, the Record of Decision signed in September 2006, the OU1 Remedial Design, State of Vermont Solid Waste and Sediment and Erosion Control requirements, and EPA green and sustainability principles.</p>
<p><strong>The Offeror shall be evaluated on past experience with similar efforts and shall demonstrate the following experience/expertise:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Mine reclamation, including experience with an acid generating oxidized waste rock, oxic and anoxic tailing; <br />&bull; Mine pit lakes, adits and other mine openings; <br />&bull; Experience with the material properties of waste rock and tailing with respect to slope stability, material workability, and final subgrade preparation; <br />&bull; Knowledge of safety procedures for working in a mine setting - material stability, physical features (tunnels, adits, pits); <br />&bull; Installation of a low-permeability cover systems which include geosynthetics, geotextiles, and/or geocomposites;<br />&bull; Passive treatment of surface and groundwater contaminated from acid generating oxidized waste rock and tailing and construction of passive treatment systems; and<br />&bull; Restoration or closure projects that comply with applicable Federal and/or State of Vermont requirements</p>
<p><strong>Interested firms shall submit a capabilities package to include the following:</strong> Business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and specific examples of past experience in performing the work requirements stated above. The project examples shall have been performed within the last seven years. The Offeror shall show project examples of all of the experience/expertise listed above. However, the experience does not have to be demonstrated on one single project. The Offeror shall provide a Point of Contact and phone number for each project example who may be contacted for further information on contractor's effort and performance.

<RESPDATE>021116
<CONTACT>Daniel App, Phone 301-415-6985, Email Daniel.App@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently competitively awarded Contract No. GS25F0010M, Order No. NRC-HQ-40-15-T-0001 to Pitney Bowes, Inc. to provide six new mail processing systems and related services to NRC, including one system for NRC headquarters, one system for each NRC regional office and one system for NRC's Technical Training Center.  Those systems were acquired to process outgoing mail parcels and to apply applicable U.S. Postal Service (USPS) postage.
<p>As is the case with all Pitney Bowes mail processing system customers, NRC must purchase USPS postage for those outgoing parcels from United States Postal Service, doing business as U.S. Postal Service (Pitney Bowes Postage) (DUNS 627875818, CAGE 1ZC88) which, in turn, acquires the postage from the USPS and applies it to the applicable Pitney Bowes systems for use.</p>
<p>Because of the limitation regarding how Pitney Bowes mail processing system customers must acquire their USPS postage, NRC intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract consisting of a base period of March 1, 2016 through February 28, 2017 plus four one-year options to United States Postal Service, doing business as U.S. Postal Service (Pitney Bowes Postage) (DUNS 627875818, CAGE 1ZC88) to provide USPS postage NRC (including its regional offices and its Technical Training Center).  The authority for this action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 491110.</p>

<RESPDATE>020816
<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Contract Specialist, Email kemper.wood@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, limited source, fixed price contract with Netbio, Inc., 266 Second Avenue, Waltham, MA, 02451-1166, for the purpose of procuring a service agreement for its existing DNAscan instrument and to procure specialized consumable reagent cartridges.
<p>In support of the FBI's Rapid DNA Initiative, the FBI Laboratory's Biometrics Analysis Section is currently evaluating the DNAscan, a Rapid DNA instrument manufactured by NetBio, Inc. A maintenance agreement is required in order to move forward with validation studies to aid the implementation of this state-of-the-art technology. This agreement will ensure that updates, preventative maintenance needs, instrument failures, instrument upgrades, and other necessary items are addressed in a timely and cost-effective manner, which, in turn, will ensure that instrument testing can progress unhindered.</p>
<p>Rapid DNA technology enables sample-to-profile DNA results in approximately 2 hours. The FBI has established a series of programs and groups to ensure this technology is responsibly implemented in order to reduce the turnaround time of the DNA analysis of reference samples, allow point-of-collection sample analysis, and ultimately aid law enforcement officials in their investigations by allowing for real-time searches of the generated DNA profiles in the national database. The chemistry used to generate this data is contained within proprietary consumable reagent cartridges designed exclusively for use with a specific Rapid DNA instrument, and, in order to implement Rapid DNA technology, a series of studies needs to be performed on both the instruments and the supplies the instruments use in order to validate the technology and ensure reliable data generation. In order for the FBI Laboratory to proceed with the required studies, it is necessary to purchase BioChipSet reagent cartridges for use on the DNAscan. Without the necessary components to perform the validation of these instruments, the process of ensuring the proper functionality of the instruments and acceptable generation of data will be compromised and further delay the overall implementation of the Rapid DNA technology.</p>
<p>The maintenance and specialized consumable regent cartridge requirements are listed below.</p>
<p>&bull; Service agreement for DNAscan Instrument<br />o Coverage to include all parts and labor<br />o 1 Preventative Maintenance service visit per year<br />&bull; BioChipSet- High DNA- PP 16, product code # NB-BCS-0001-100<br />&bull; BioChipSet- Lo DNA- PP 16, product code# NB-LBCS-0001-100</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Netbio, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the DNAscan instrument and its associated reagent cartridges; therefore, they are the only company capable of providing the necessary service, support and consumable products for this instrument.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Monday, February 8, 2016, 2016 (3:00 pm Eastern).</span></strong> Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>TITLE: Planned Sole Source Contract with VIGOR WORKS LLC for the Overhaul of 6 Hydraulic Cylinders in support of the CUP McCook Main Tunnel System Project<br />In compliance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (d) (2), coupled with the provisions set forth by FAR Subpart 5.101(a) (1), this Notice is hereby published to inform of the following:<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District intends to award a sole source contract to its original service provider under its new corporate name "Vigor Works, LLC" for the overhaul of 6 Hydraulic Cylinders; these are major components of the McCook Main Tunnel System. The services described hereunder are deemed available only from the original source provider for the continued provision of highly specialized services. If awarded to any other source, a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition would result, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Chicago District's requirements would be encountered. (Re: FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) (A) and (B))
<p>By customization methods, the original service provider under its multi-million dollar Contract with the Chicago District (W912P6-08-C-0023), fabricated hydraulic cylinders that are now required for overhaul. The hydraulic cylinders are significant in price, size and weight. The intricacies of the design were implemented into the customization of the cylinders, wherein specifically designed and manufactured for the McCook project. If the cylinders aren't seamlessly overhauled, it would cause serious detriments to the McCook project, specifically to the ongoing construction contract wherein it requires the government to furnish the cylinders as government furnished items.</p>
<p>Critical activities for the work entails, overhauling without compromising the functionality of the cylinders during the entire overhaul process; and eliminating any risk of damage while in transportation to the point where the overhaul is to take place. Another important factor relates to warranties of the cylinders. At present, an extended warranty on the wearable parts is still active; however, in order to maintain the validity of the extended warranty under the original provider's contract with its parts manufacturer, the departure of the original service provider would mean loss of coverage.</p>
<p>Of major significance, the cylinders must undergo a thorough and extensive internal and external inspection to determine if items or conditions would compromise the functionality of the cylinders, in particular, if rust is on the inside surfaces. While the cylinders are filled with fluid to help mitigate this potential corrosion, it does not entirely remove the risk. As the original service provider, it has the necessary resources to determine the extent of any compromised surface and how it would need to be addressed. Furthermore, if rust is found on the surface, it must be removed, likely through a process called machining. Only the manufacturer would be able to determine the extent to which machining could be done to stay within the safety parameters, as too much machining would compromise the operation of the cylinder. Machining accomplished by a new source would void the existing parts warranty as well.</p>
<p>At the end of the overhaul process, the wearable parts are replaced, machining is completed, and the cylinders are reassembled. This is followed by acceptance testing that is equivalent to the factory acceptance tests that the manufacturer performed prior to acceptance by the Government (under the previous Contract). The test must be performed to replicate the original factory acceptance test and demonstrate that the cylinders are in like-new condition.</p>
<p><br />In consideration of the high risks and type of testing involved, the overhaul must be pursued with the right technical abilities, skill and care that can be provided by the original service provider. It requires a high level of expertise that only the original source provider can deliver as guarantor of the custom-made cylinders.</p>
<p>With respect to mitigating risks, only the original source provider can produce such assurances. It has the technical resources necessary to soundly perform the overhaul, machining and testing along with an existing parts warranty, meaning the government would not need to duplicate costs for fabricating new cylinders or obtaining new warranties, as such costs have been incurred and already compensated via the previous contract with the original provider. In addition, the original service provider possesses the standard of care required to transport these units without damage, as demonstrated during its previous contract with the Chicago District. Any damages due to a mishap in handling or transporting these cylinders would have a significant cost and schedule impact to the overall McCook project.</p>
<p>The timing of the overhaul is crucial. The overhaul activity must be performed before the construction contractor can accept them for installation in the Main Tunnel System. As mentioned above, they are considered government furnished items; therefore, they must be timely furnished to the construction contractor to avoid impacts to that particular contract and the overall project. All six cylinders must be completely overhauled and delivered to the McCook Reservoir site by June 1, 2016. Of major importance, there are no spares. For every day the cylinders are not delivered, the Government would incur a cost of $20,000 per day. These custom cylinders would take from two-three years to refabricate. If a cylinder(s) was inadvertently damaged during transportation or during overhaul, the Government would be incur a potential replacement cost of $7.3 - $21.9M.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned, as the installation of the cylinders is a milestone in the critical path of the CUP McCook Reservoir Final Preparation project, any delay of the installation would cause a significant delay in the completion of follow on milestones and ultimately severely compromise the completion of the project. Compromise of the completion of the project would pose a highly negative impact on the community, as the project's ultimate goal is to provide mitigation of flood water which would significantly reduce potential flood water damage.</p>
<p>By contracting with the original source provider, it would allow the government to obtain the continued provision of highly specialized services; avoid unacceptable delays, and eliminate any substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS, PROPOSALS, ETC;&nbsp;however, interested firms may send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN the close of business on February 15, 2016. Statements should be sent to the attention of Pamela Brown at <a href="mailto:pamela.j.brown@usace.army.mil">pamela.j.brown@usace.army.mil</a> ; ensure that the subject line of your email includes the title/description of this announcement. <br /><br />The government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price services contract to Vigor Works, LLC by April 1, 2016.</p>

Task orders will be negotiated and awarded under the IDIQ based on a Request for Proposal (RFP) and specific Scope of Work (SOW) provided by the Federal Government after award of the base IDIQ. Work could begin in Fall 2016 and will extend over a 5 year period. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to receive a government contract. The website for registration is https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The contract will have the geographic boundaries of the North Atlantic Division mission area although the location of the majority of the work to be performed under this contract shall be specific to the Callahan Mine Superfund Site, Brooksville, Maine, and other project sites within the State of Maine.</p>
<p>The former Callahan Mine was a hard-rock, open-pit mine developed in Goose Pond, a shallow tidal estuary of approximately 75 acres in the village of Harborside in the Town of Brooksville, Maine. The Site is located approximately 15 miles west of the town of Blue Hill and 35 miles west of the town of Bar Harbor on the northwest side of the Cape Rosier peninsula on Penobscot Bay.</p>
<p>From the 1880s to the 1970s, the Site was the subject of intermittent exploration and mining for copper, lead, and zinc, with the largest of these mining operations occurring, from 1968 through 1972. During this timeframe, approximately five million tons of waste rock and approximately 800,000 tons of ore-bearing rock were mined from an open-pit mine. The waste rock was disposed of on the site in large stockpiles and was also utilized for a starter dike and subsequent lifts of the Tailings Impoundment dam. The outside footprint of the Tailings Impoundment encompasses approximately 17-acres and contains about 716,000 cubic yards of mining related waste, including the fine sand, silt, and clay-sized rock particles. The tailings are contained by a three-sided dam that was raised against a sloping hillside. Most of the dam is constructed of cobble and boulder-sized waste rock materials. The eastern side of the dam is about 60 feet tall and has an average slope of about 1.3H to 1V (horizontal to vertical). Site activities and passage of time has also resulted in river sediment and surface water contamination. The mine is still submerged 30 feet below mean sea level within the estuary with a diameter of 600 feet, depth of 300 feet and estimated volume of 1,300,000 cubic yards.</p>
<p>The work involves establishing safety zones and procedures near steep slopes and open water, protection of existing environmental resources, preparation and implementation of an air monitoring program, installation and monitoring of geotechnical instrumentation, clearing of vegetation, temporary and permanent surface water diversions, installation of horizontal drains for dewatering and vertical drains for consolidation, construction of working surfaces and access roads, onsite quarrying to include drilling, blasting and crushing of virgin bedrock, crushing or blasting of large rock, excavation, relocation, consolidation and grading of rock, waste rock and tailing, significant earthwork requiring appropriate erosion and sediment control best management practices (BMPs), installation of a low permeability permanent cover currently designed to include a geosynthetic clay liner, 60-mil low density polyethylene membrane, geocomposite, and 15" protective layer, topsoil and seed, construction of mitigation wetlands and construction of passive treatment wetlands, check dams and/or lined French drains to intercept flow and treat to meet surface water quality standards, sediment excavation with confirmatory sampling, transport of sediment, rock and other mining materials for disposal in the existing mine, monitoring of surface and groundwater, including monitoring well installation, to ensure effectiveness of the remedy, performance of site-wide inspection and maintenance including but not limited to caps, roads, wetlands, and invasive species, and implementation of institutional controls. All work will be performed in accordance with CERCLA, other applicable or relevant and appropriate Federal, State and Local Government regulations, and EPA green and sustainability principles.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A) For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA251-16-AP-0955

1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10 West, Ann Arbor Medical Center, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: Sole source justification to Elekta for firm-fixed price contract. Stereostatic System to support Deep Brain Stimulation treatment.


3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: This is a positioning system for Deep Brain Stimulations (DBS). It is mechanical and is designed to very specifically support DBS procedures. This positioner could support other neurological cases, but other positioners cannot support DBS procedures. Estimated value is $186,495.68. Delivery Date is 30 days after date of award or sooner. The complete system consists of Frame G Kit, Stereotactic Arc, MR-Indicator, Open CT-Indicator, Cross Hairs Kit, Clamps, Adapters, CT-Table, installation and training.


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:

( X ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; ( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;



5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): DBS procedures probe deep into the brain and place stimulators into the brain in order to treat disorders such as Parkinson's Disease or brain injuries. The positioning system must be extremely precise and not interfere with the imaging equipment used to place the stimulator. This is the only positioner known to either this VA or the Surgeons who will conduct these procedures.
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: An internet search was conducted using the following terms:
 


a.	Deep Brain Stimulation positioner
b.	Deep Brain Stimulation positioning
c.	Deep Brain Stimulation equipment

None of the searches identified any positioner options within the first two search pages. Sources Sought was conducted on GSA eBuy, with zero responses.


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: There is no indication that the quoted price is unreasonable. There is government discount included of $7,819.32. FA860115P0081 purchase through the Department of the Air Force with same system purchases in Feb 24, 2015. IAW FAR 13.106-3 price was found reasonable on this previous purchase.


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was conducted with no other company identified that can provide similar equipment. As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by posting on GSA eBuy with zero responses.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: The surgeons who perform these procedures also perform these procedures at the medical affiliate, The University of Michigan Health System and use the same equipment as this request. It is safer for patients when the surgeons have an intimate knowledge of the equipment they are using. The VAAAHS does not wish to inject any possible confusion about equipment usage into any surgical suites and believes that this request is in the best interest of the patient.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None found. Equipment was posted on GSA eBuy with zero responses.



11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: DBS is still a new technology with limited suppliers. As the practice becomes more common and equipment more available, VAAAHS will consider other equipment options.

12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona   Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a capabilities statement to include evidence of being a telecommunications company which has the ability to deliver Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability at the Government demarcation point at the site specified in the Appendix 10 attachment, page 1.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services <br />2a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror submits a sound approach for supporting local communication services in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's capability to meet all SOW and site-specific Appendix 10 requirements. Reference the Appendix 10, para. 10.13 attachment A, "Traditional Legacy" and attachment B, "Utilizing SIP Trunking", or Offerors may use a combination of both attachments to submit the Offeror's diagram. Provide the requested diagram and legend using these formats or a similar format.</p>
<p>2b. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a written description of each service that will be delivered in the site-specific diagram and the methodology of their delivery.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Evidence of Agreements.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror states whether your company is providing a proposal as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). If providing a proposal as a CLEC for ANY and/or ALL services, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>To access the full Broad Agency Announcement, research topics, and application instructions, click on the 'Additional Documentation' hyperlink under 'Additional Info' at the end of this synopsis.
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Foundational Science Research Unit (FSRU) of the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) solicits new proposals for its fiscal year 2016 program of basic research in behavioral science. It is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) and 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, and subsequent amendments.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences is the Army's lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for the improvement of Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, training, and leader development issues. The basic research program supports research projects that are designed to expand fundamental knowledge and discover general principles in the behavioral and social sciences.</p>
<p>Proposals should describe their contribution to theory and how their results might lead to basic behavioral research that would be meaningful to the Army. Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to submit a white paper before submitting a full proposal. This sequence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and minimizes the labor and cost associated with submission of full proposals that have minimal probability of being selected for funding. Costs associated with white paper or full proposal submissions in response to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charges to any resulting award. These costs may be allowable expenses to normal bid and proposal indirect costs specified in FAR 31.205-18. Offerors submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Government Contracting or Grants Officer may obligate the Government to any legal instrument involving expenditure of Government funds.</p>
<p>Decisions to award new basic research awards are subject to funds availability, and ARI may choose to not award any new basic research awards due to unavailability of funds or other factors. Due to Government budget uncertainties,</p>
<p>(1) no specific dollars have been reserved for total awards under this BAA, and</p>
<p>(2) no award floor or ceiling thresholds have been established for individual awards under this BAA.</p>
<p>Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&amp;D) in those areas specified in SECTION A of the Broad Agency Announcement. Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts. Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and U.S. Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients. However, they may be able to participate as subcontractors or subrecipients (eligibility will be determined on a case by case basis).</p>
<p>This BAA is also available at http://www.grants.gov under solicitation number W911NF-16-R-0005.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION<br /></span></strong>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures in combination with FAR 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. <br /> <br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-RFQ-16-155 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</span></strong><br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SET-ASIDE STATUS</span></strong><br />This acquisition is NOT set-aside for small businesses and is available for full and open competition.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ACQUISITION AUTHORITY </span></strong><br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures in combination with FAR 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This acquisition is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-86, dated January 1, 2016. The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Section on Neuroanatomy requires regeneratively mode-locked, 70fs tunable light source with automated dispersion compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements</strong><br />The laboratory requires a regeneratively mode-locked, 70 fs tunable light source with automated dispersion compensation.<br />A demonstration system is acceptable so long as it is a very recently manufactured system with the full new product warranty.<br /><br />The system is to include:<br />1.   Regenerative mode-locking, not passive or Kerr Lens only mode-locking.<br />2.  Pulse width of 70 fs.<br />3.  Automated dispersion compensation module, capable of being used with similar Mai Tai lasers.<br />4.   The higher the level of on-site service and repair that can be provided, will enhance group productivity.<br />5.  Tuning range of 690-1040 nm.<br />6.  Repetition rate 80 MHz nominal.<br />7.  The laboratory has developed custom software for a microscope to control the Mai Tai laser and Deep See.  This software would take several man-months to replicate with a different laser.<br />8.   Deep See automatically compensates for the pulse broadening encountered in the optical train of a microscope, lenses, modulators, and filters.  The pulse broadening is not the same value for all wavelengths.  It is nearly twice as great at the shorter end of the tuning curve as it is at the longer [redder] wavelengths.  The Deep See will set the desired value of pre-compensation automatically as the Mai Tai is tuned in wavelength.<br />9.  The Deep See module can be used on virtually any Mai Tai laser providing flexibility for the laboratory.  Other designs are part of the laser and cannot have this capability.<br />10. Generate and store multiple dispersion compensation curves.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance</strong><br />Delivery of the equipment shall be within 30 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Type</strong><br />The Government intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase order for this requirement.</p>

The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.    <br /> <br />The Molecular Neuropharmacology Section of NINDS utilizes cell-based assays in the ongoing characterization of compounds. These compound characterizations with dopamine receptor interactions have great implications on various neurological disorders. The protocol utilized with our research calls for the use of specific reagents and thus machinery that is used in our studies. This acquisition will permit production for high-throughput screening of many novel compounds that are expected to act on dopamine receptors, evaluating these compounds for use as research tools and possibly further preclinical validation in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Objective<br />The purpose of the acquisition is for The Molecular Neuropharmacology Section of NINDS to acquire a multi-mode reader, PHERAstarFS or equivalent, for high-throughput screening to continue the efforts in compound development and high throughput screening of drugs on the dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />The NINDS MNS requires one multifunctional microplate reader for reading complex biological assays. The PHERAstarFS or equivalent microplate reader must meet the following requirements:<br />1.	Precise measurement of small volume (up to 3456-well plates), which allows for faster, cost-effective and a more efficient way to screen large compound libraries.  The instrument must be adaptable to future filter needs and capable of reading all current assay outputs including BRET, FRET, HTRF, and complementation assays.<br />2.	The microplate reader must be able to measure both emission channels for FRET and fluorescence polarization at the same time.  <br />3.	 The microplate reader must be able to collect 1mm resolution of UV/V absorbance<br />4.	The microplate reader must have two photomultiplier tubes dedicated only for time-resolved fluorescence and TR-FRET/HTRF; as well as two photomultiplier tubes dedicated for fluorescence intensity and luminescence.  This is essential to obtain the sensitivity needed for our assays that relatively low signal strengths. <br />5.	The microplate reader must be able to read UV/V absorbance spectrum from 220nM to 1000 nM<br />6.	The microplate reader must be able to read each well quickly ( &lt;1second/well) <br />7.	The microplate reader must contain a Z-height adjustment from above and below the microplate in 0.1 mm increments as we use multiple different types of assay plates and so the reader must be flexible to read precisely from these different plate types.</p>
<p>Delivery Date<br />The Contractor shall deliver and install the required equipment within 70 days after receipt of order on approximately May 1, 2016.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to mitchell.a.robison@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of proposals.</p>

<p>Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) provides test and engineering support services to the Global Command and Control System (GCCS), Tactical Combat Operations (TCO)/Joint Tactical Common Operational Picture (COP) Workstation (JTCW) Program Offices as directed by the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Command, Control and Communications (C3) Program Office. MCTSSA is involved in all aspects of GCCS-TCO/JTCW Family of Systems (FoS) testing to include developmental testing, engineering evaluations, developer-assist testing, stability and performance testing, government acceptance testing and joint certification testing. MCTSSA focuses on testing GCCS-TCO/JTCW FoS within an operationally representative MAGTF Command and Control (C2) architecture executing operational mission threads under representative network loads. The operationally relevant architecture represents Division down to Battalion echelons utilizing the Combat Operations Center (COC) and AN/PRC-117G Radios.</p>
<p>The MCTSSA GCCS-TCO/JTCW FoS team works with the Operational Forces Tactical Systems Support Center (OFTSSC), as well as other C2 Programs of Record (PoR) providing GCCS-TCO/JTCW FoS subject matter expertise (SME) for test events, exercises and Operating Forces feedback. The MCTSSA team provides support with setup, configuration and troubleshooting of the GCCS-TCO/JTCW FoS. The MCTSSA team also identifies software issues, generates Trouble Reports (TR), and conducts engineering analysis to further define issues and potential work arounds. MCTSSA is a voting member in the GCCS-TCO/JTCW FoS Technical Review Board (TRB) for the vetting of TRs, and a member of the GCCS-TCO/JTCW FoS Test Integrated Product Team (IPT) and Logistics IPT.</p>
<p>The GCCS-TCO system runs on the Tactical COP Server (TCS) platform which is composed of an Oracle T-5140 server and TSC software. The TCS software is integrated using the GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J) Global software required for a COP. The TCS requires regular updates and patches to correct fleet-reported defects and to maintain compliance with its parent GCCS-J baseline.</p>
<p>TCS is the principal tool within the MAGTF for Situational Awareness (SA) through distribution of the Common Tactical Picture (CTP) and is the primary entry point for the COP. TCS provides commanders at all echelons with the ability to map and display friendly and enemy locations, as well as plan, develop, display, and transmit overlays of intended movements. TCS also provides commanders in both garrison and tactical operations the ability to receive, fuse, store, develop, display, and transmit Commanders' Critical Information Requirements (CCIR).</p>
<p>The current Marine Corps tactical workstation is the Tactical COP Workstation (TCW). TCW is composed of a window based laptop and JTCW software. JTCW is a suite of applications designed for Battalion and Above (BAA) that facilitates military C2 by improving SA and enhancing operational and tactical decision-making.</p>
<p>Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) is the core Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) application for JTCW. When connected to a network, the C2PC exchanges positional tactical track data with Tactical Data Base Management (TDBM) found on the GCCS based servers, primarily the TCS, and provides a complete geographically based situational awareness capability, which includes the capability to display GCCS COP data.</p>
<p>In a stand-alone mode (not connected to a network), C2PC operators can produce operational graphics and input track data. Upon reconnection to a network, TDBM track data is synchronized with the TCS. With this electronic connectivity, C2PC becomes a powerful tool for the commander by providing a comprehensive CTP of the battlefield. JTCW combines C2PC, C2PC Application Extensions (AEs), and a number of other tools into an integrated software load aimed at enhancing the overall system functionality. C2PC provides the basic COP track and overlay interaction with the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) variants. It also provides the geographic map surface for plotting tracks, overlays, and other geo-located objects, and it has Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable JTCW AEs to use C2PC mapping, plotting, overlays, communications, address book, and route planning services.</p>
<p>Both GCCS-TCO and JTCW are Post-Milestone C, in the Operations and Support phase. Both TCS and JTCW annually release software composed of enhancements to existing capabilities and software fixes.</p>
<p>The Program Engineering &amp; Support Group (PESG) at MCTSSA has a continuing need concerning test and evaluation support services for the fulfillment of the GCCS-TCO/JTCW T&amp;E project responsibilities related to the developmental testing, engineering evaluations, developer-assist testing, stability and performance testing, government acceptance testing, and joint certification testing within the MAGTF C2 environment.</p>
<p>All responsible vendors complying with the above description may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by MCTSSA. The vendor's quotation shall describe in detail their technical understanding and approach to the tasks specified in the attached PWS/QASP.</p>
<p>The procurement is for the Global Command and Control System (GCCS), Tactical Combat Operations (TCO)/Joint Tactical Common Operational Picture (COP) Workstation (JTCW) to be delivered to Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), MCB Camp Pendleton, CA.</p>

If this determination is not received, the Department of Veterans Affairs reserves the right to obtain the service from another source and to charge the Contractor with any excess cost which may result there from.  The Department of Veterans Affairs will be the sole judge in determining when to order service from another source.

e.	Regardless of whether the delivery ordered is regular or accelerated copies, if the contractor fails to deliver the transcript to the Government within the applicable period prescribed, a reduction in price will be made as liquidated damages.  The amount to be paid for the transcript will be reduced by two percent (2%) of the price for the transcript, computed at the rates set forth in this contract, for each Government business day or fraction thereof that delivery is delayed beyond the time limit prescribed depending on which has been ordered by the presiding official, up to a total of fifty percent (50%) of the transcript price.  Computation of price reductions shall commence on the day following the date on which transcripts were to be delivered to the Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Biloxi, MS.  Failure to furnish a reporting service or delinquency in the delivery of a transcript is a default, and subjects the Contractor to the default provision of this agreement.

8.	PRIVACY INFORMATION
The contractor's on-site supervisor will secure (in a sealed envelope) and relinquish any documentation found anywhere on the VA grounds that contains sensitive patient and/or employee information (i.e. privacy information) within 60 minutes of finding such documentation to Ms. Melanie Lane, Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Privacy Officer, Bldg T-102, Room No. A132, Phone: (228) 523-5526.  If Ms. Lane is not available, please relinquish any documentation found to the Police Services (Bldg 17).

In the event that the contractor should lose any records, transcripts or confidential information associated with their assigned work, the Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Privacy Officer, Ms. Melanie Lane, and the COTR (Contracting Officer Technical Representative) should be promptly notified.  The notification should take place within 60 minutes of the contractor confirming that the identified information cannot be located.  The initial notification may be verbal, by phone call or in person, with the official communication in writing to follow within the identified timeframe (i.e., 60 minutes).     

9.	PRIVACY TRAINING
Mandatory VA provided Privacy Training will be completed by all contract employees before any on-site work begins under the contract.  Approximately one (1) hour of Privacy Training will be provided for all employees who, along with their on-site supervisor, will be required to be to read over and sign the training documents.  These training documents must then be forwarded to the Contracting Officer prior to the on-site work beginning.  Any new contractor employee(s) hired after the contract becomes effective must complete the mandatory VA provided Privacy Training prior to starting work.

<DESC>To access the full Broad Agency Announcement, research topics, and application instructions, click on the 'Broad Agency Announcement'&nbsp;PDF file at the end of this synopsis.
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Foundational Science Research Unit (FSRU) of the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) solicits new proposals for its fiscal year 2016 program of basic research in behavioral science. It is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d) (2) and 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, and subsequent amendments.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences is the Army's lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for the improvement of Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, training, and leader development issues. The basic research program supports research projects that are designed to expand fundamental knowledge and discover general principles in the behavioral and social sciences.</p>
<p>Proposals should describe their contribution to theory and how their results might lead to basic behavioral research that would be meaningful to the Army. Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to submit a white paper before submitting a full proposal. This sequence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and minimizes the labor and cost associated with submission of full proposals that have minimal probability of being selected for funding. Costs associated with white paper or full proposal submissions in response to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charges to any resulting award. These costs may be allowable expenses to normal bid and proposal indirect costs specified in FAR 31.205-18. Offerors submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Government Contracting or Grants Officer may obligate the Government to any legal instrument involving expenditure of Government funds.</p>
<p>Decisions to award new basic research awards are subject to funds availability, and ARI may choose to not award any new basic research awards due to unavailability of funds or other factors. Due to Government budget uncertainties,</p>
<p>(1) no specific dollars have been reserved for total awards under this BAA, and</p>
<p>(2) no award floor or ceiling thresholds have been established for individual awards under this BAA.</p>
<p>Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&amp;D) in those areas specified in SECTION A of the Broad Agency Announcement. Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts. Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and U.S. Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients. However, they may be able to participate as subcontractors or subrecipients (eligibility will be determined on a case by case basis).</p>
<p>This BAA is also available at http://www.grants.gov under solicitation number W911NF-16-R-0005.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

All other attachments may be deleted. <br /><strong><br />TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</strong>
<p>The first key technical requirement for the JMEMs production contract is software development to enhance, modify, and sustain existing custom software systems consisting of engagement level modeling and simulation components. The JMEMs custom software systems are used to determine weaponeering results for multiple conventional weapon systems and platforms against multiple target types, and are also used to determine a quantitative operational evaluation of air combat tactics, missile intercept probability, and aircrew performance. Weaponeering results consist of but are not limited to probability of damage estimates considering target vulnerability, weapon effects, munition delivery errors, user defined damage criteria, weapon reliability, and terrain effects. <br />The second key technical requirement for the JMEMs production contract is to assist the Government in the analysis, production, utilization and publication of weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability data products. JMEMs weapon effectiveness data includes system characteristic and performance data for multiple air-to-surface, air-to-air, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface weapons, direct and indirect fire weapons guided and unguided weapon systems; these systems includes but are not limited to missiles, rockets, bombs, artillery, mortars, small caliber guns, naval gun systems, tank rounds, as well as non-kinetic and offensive cyber effects capabilities. JMEM target vulnerability data includes, but is not limited to; target models consisting of personnel, fixed and rotary winged aircraft, ships, armored and un-armored military vehicles, land based equipment and weapon systems, as well as infrastructure elements such as bridges, underground bunkers and tunnels, and above-ground buildings.<br /><br /><strong>KEY COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />The scientific emphasis of the JMEMs software and data products requires advanced education, knowledge and skill in Advanced Mathematics, Physics and Engineering as well as recent and relevant expertise in modeling and analysis of damage effects from multiple types of kinetic and thermobaric weapons against personnel, military and commercial vehicles and equipment, hardened and non-hardened structural targets. The specific key competencies required to accomplish the scientific emphasis of the JMEMs products includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Software and Systems Engineering<br />&bull; Relational Database Design and Administration<br />&bull; Computer Networking and Information Technology<br />&bull; Blast Propagation <br />&bull; Warhead Penetration and Fragmentation<br />&bull; Weapon Trajectory (3DOF and 6DOF Modeling)<br />&bull; Weapon Cratering and Ground Shock Propagation<br />&bull; Materials Science - Properties and Response of Solids<br />&bull; 3-D Structural Modeling and Structural Response<br />&bull; Personnel and Equipment Vulnerability<br />&bull; Design of Experiments (DoE)<br />&bull; Finite Element (FE) and Statistical Analysis.</p>
<p>An additional critical part of the JMEMs production contract is the training of active duty weaponeers and targeteers in the JMEM software products; therefore, additional areas of specialized knowledge, skill and experience in the area of training are also required. The key competencies associated with training include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of DoD Operational Command center functions<br />&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of Standard Operating Procedures for Weaponeering, Targeteering and Mission Planning<br />&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of Collateral Damage Methodology and Estimation<br />&bull; Military experience and/or knowledge of Target Material Production in support of deliberate and dynamic targeting process<br />&bull; Military experience and/or Knowledge of Joint Publications/Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instructions associated with Weaponeering, Targeteering, Collateral Damage and Coordinate Mensuration<br />&bull; Lesson planning and Training Documentation Development.</p>
<p>Software development tasks for the JMEMs production contract will require a demonstrated proficiency in the design, implementation and verification of engineering and engagement level modeling and simulation software. The key software development competencies include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) <br />&bull; Software Design Patterns<br />&bull; User Interface Design<br />&bull; Application Program Interface (API) Design<br />&bull; Modern Software Framework/Architecture<br />&bull; 3D Graphics Rendering and Imagery Replication <br />&bull; Software Documentation and Unified Modeling Language (UML)<br />&bull; HTML, XML, C, C++, C#, FORTRAN, JAVA<br />&bull; Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library<br />&bull; Relational Database Design and Administration and SQL<br />&bull; Cybersecurity, namely the safe storage and network dissemination of classified data, in particular the DoD Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework v1.0 dated September 2015.<br />&bull; Computer Network Communication Protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, SOAP)</p>
<p>Systems and Software Engineering Processes are also considered a critical knowledge area required for the JMEM production contract. Respondents to this notice shall provide examples that demonstrate experience in the implementation of Systems and Software Engineering processes which are equivalent to Maturity Level 3 in the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Staged Representation for Systems and Software Engineering. Additionally, each respondent to this notice must possess key competencies in the following Software Development areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Software Design, Analysis and Documentation<br />&bull; Software Project Planning and Integrated Project Management<br />&bull; Requirements Management and Development<br />&bull; Configuration Management <br />&bull; Verification (Software Test to include unit, integration, and system level verification, as well dynamic and static forms of software test)<br />&bull; Validation<br />&bull; Software Quality Assurance and Metrics Evaluation<br />&bull; Product Integration<br />&bull; Technical Solution<br />&bull; Risk Management<br />&bull; Effort and Cost Estimation<br />&bull; Decision Analysis and Resolution<br />&bull; Organizational Process Focus, Definition and Training</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The JMEMs software systems and data operate and are distributed on Government classified networks; therefore JMEMs production will require an expert level of knowledge related to the application of Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) requirements for obtaining authority to operate, as well as DoD guidance for classification marking and foreign releasability. Additionally, security clearances will be required of all personnel working on JMEMs products.</p>
<p>Production of JMEMs software and data products may be performed across geographically separated contractor facilities. However, the majority of development and production of JMEMs software products must be performed in a Government owned facility located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Additional contractor support and subject matter expertise in the area of direct fire weapons and air combat tactics and maneuvers will be required at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Each respondent to this notice should be capable of recruiting and retaining top quality employees at each of the Government facility locations mentioned above.</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis - Global Enterprise Fabric - concept requirement of Cloud Computing and the evolution of LandWarNet (LWN) enterprise.</p>
<p>The Global Enterprise Fabric is the Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) description for a cloud enterprise hosting environment that is envisioned to provide the US Army a complete suite of computing enterprise services under three broad areas: Infrastructure as a Service, Network Services, and Computer Network Defense. NETCOM will implement these requirements to meet the Department of Defense goals of a secure network and a responsive enterprise as envisioned by the Joint Information Environment (JIE).</p>
<p>The scope of the requirements applies to Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and Global Mission Network (GMN) environments for all US army units and organizations, including Army National Guard and Army Reserves. The GMN is a separate network that the Army built to extend strategic SIPRNET to the tactical formations. The intent is to merge the GMN infrastructure into the GEF using the same technical concepts of cloud, virtualization and hosted services.</p>
<p>This requirement is anticipated to be solicited as unrestricted in order to obtain a vendor who can support this requirement.</p>

<DESC>The Government seeks to identify sources capable of designing and/or producing a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer that will be able to haul the M1A2 Variants and M88A2 vehicles while meeting CONUS/OCONUS Transportability Requirements. Two goals are looking to be met at this time. The first, which is the short term goal, is obtaining a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer that can transport the current M1A2SEPv2 (up to 77 Ton) while meeting CONUS/OCONUS axle weights for peace time administrative moves. The current HETS system (M1070A0/A1 Tractors with M1000 Trailer) does not meet CONUS/OCONUS Transportability Requirements and is not able to haul loads over 70 Tons in the current configuration. The second (long term) goal is obtaining a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer that will be able to haul the M1A2SEPv3 Abrams Battle Tank, which will be ~82 Tons and fielded in FY2020. Based on this goal, the Government is looking into Tractor and Trailer solutions for hauling an 82 Ton threshold, 87 Ton objective payload while still meeting CONUS/OCONUS Transportability Requirements. <br /><br />The current Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) M1070A1 Tractor front axle exceeds CONUS weight limit of 20,000 lbs. regardless of armor or payload. The HET M1070A1 Tractor front axle exceeds Europe weight limit of 12,000 kg (26,455 lbs.) when the cab is armored with a Force protection package of ~6 Ton. The HET M1070A0 Tractor front axle exceeds CONUS weight limits, but not Europe weight limit. The HET M1000 Trailer pay-loaded with M1A2SEPv2 or M88 exceeds CONUS and Europe axle weight limits. The HET M1070A0 and M1070A1 Tractors' rear tridem exceeds CONUS tridem weight limits when pay-loaded. Europe measures the axles individually at a 12,000 kg limit, which is not met. The current HET exceeds European Bridge Military Load Classification (MLC) limits. Currently, Special road permits are being denied due to axle weights for HETS movement in California (M1070A1 &amp; M1000) &amp; Germany (M1000). States CONUS have varying axle weight limits. US and European load limits also vary. Current HETS exceeds length, width, and total payload limits for unrestricted highway transportation.
<p>Market Survey Request: The Government seeks to determine industry capacity to provide a Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer capability to meet the transportability and payload needs for CONUS and OCONUS as detailed in paragraph 1 for both the short term and long term goals. The questions are expanded upon in the Market Survey Questionnaire. Please provide any information describing your company's capabilities, quality, cost, other relevant information not specifically requested. This market research process is intended to obtain only non-proprietary available information about your company's capabilities. The associated Purchase Descriptions (ATPD's) are attached to this survey for the existing M1070 Tractor and M1000 Trailer. Ideally, the Government hopes your solution would meet both of these purchase descriptions, but at the increased weights for the short and long term solutions. The United States Government (USG) does NOT wish to obtain any proprietary or otherwise protected documents as a result of this market survey. The USG may return data or documents that have proprietary or protected markings. <br />All portions of this market survey are for market research purposes, subject to change at any time, are in no way binding on the USG, and do not represent an established requirement. This market survey is furnished for information purposes only with the understanding that the USG is under no obligation of any kind to proceed with an acquisition in any way related to or based upon the information set forth herein. Nothing contained in this survey should be regarded as a basis upon which to seek payment, reimbursement or other consideration from the USG. Moreover, this market survey is not intended as a solicitation of offers or request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Equipment Technical Review Days: Please be aware that there will be an opportunity for vendors and OEMs responding to the Market Survey, to view the equipment at TARDEC, Detroit Arsenal Warren, MI Building 219, on 20 and 21 January 2016. This will give vendors time to inspect and measure physical HETS systems and ask any specific questions. Equipment planned to be on display will be an M1070A0/A1 Tractor, M1000 Trailer, and Abrams M1A2SEPv2 Battle Tank. Further details and/or specifics will be provided such as a website to sign up for attending equipment technical review days at a later date.</p>
<p>Response Format: Electronic responses are required respectively for parts 1 and 2 of the Questionnaire. It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats: Microsoft Word 2010 or earlier, Microsoft Excel 2010 or earlier, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 or earlier or Adobe Acrobat. The maximum size of each e-mail message should be no more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes. You may use multiple e-mail messages. The subject line must include the message number, (example: 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3), and quote mark "[Company's Name] response to Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer Market Survey". All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to respond to this market survey in order to be eligible for future contract awards.</p>
<p>Responses Due: It is anticipated that the Fed BIZ Ops announcement window will open on or about 1 December 2015. Responses shall be furnished to the government by NLT 1300 EST on 04 March 2016. Please submit electronic responses to this survey, as well as questions for clarification to:</p>
<p>Michael.h.rogers20.civ@mail.mil</p>
<p>MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE AND CURRENT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>The questionnaire and relevant information for design considerations below are intended to provide a snapshot of the situation so that you can provide your company's capabilities for delivering a solution for a new Tractor and Trailer for the Short and/or Long Term Soltution. The questionnaire will be broken into two separate sections. Responses can be made submitted for the Tractor only, Trailer only, or both the Tractor and Trailer together, depending on your company's expertise.</p>
<p>TRACTOR AND TRAILER RELEVANT INFORMATION AND DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:</p>
<p>Please refer to attached Heavy Equipment Tractor and Trailer Purchase Descriptions (ATPD's) for the current M1070 and M1000 to obtain specific and important information that your solutions for the short and long term are recommended to have incorporated.

The United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) is seeking a qualified contractor, experienced in historical restoration, to provide labor, material, tools, and equipment to replace the roof on the American Merchant Marine Museum (AMMM), which is located at 300 Steamboat Road, Great Neck, New York on the USMMA campus. Both the USMMA and the AMMM are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; USMMA as a National Historic District with the AMMM listed separately. <br /><br />http://www.marad.dot.gov/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Barstow_House_NR_Nomination.pdf.<br /><br />Invitation&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bid will be issued on this Federal Business Opportunities website on or about February 5, 2016 for this construction project.

The material is at the end of its useful life and requires replacement, with repair work being needed on the structure just below the tiles. The existing terra-cotta tiles will be replaced with similar, sound, terra-cotta barrel tiles or new synthetic tiles so that the entire roof resembles the original roof. The roof is approximately 4,800 square feet. <br /><br />All work shall be completed 197 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. Prior to commencing work, the contractor receiving award shall provide proof that an OSHA certified "competent person" (CP) (29 CFR 1926.20 (b)(2) with 30 hour OSHA certification will maintain a presence at the work site whenever the general or subcontractors are present.

<p>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to purchase CW-1181D, CW-1181E and CW-1147 Domes that meet the requirements of Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) drawings. A five (5) year Indefinite Quantity/ Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ), Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) type contract is anticipated. The contract intends to purchase the following: CW-1147 dome mold drawings, CW-1147 mold, CW-1147/CW-1181D/CW-1181E pre-production domes, and CW-1147/CW-1181D/CW-1181E production domes in accordance with Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) drawings.

<p>In order to receive the Drawings, offerors must be registered according to DOD<br />Joint Certification Program (JCP). See website http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp for further information. The drawings are attachments to this posting.</p>
<p>Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) to be eligible for award. Instructions for registration are available at the website.</p>

<div>USAID/Kosovo is issuing and amendment of the RFI-167-16-000001 for the TEAM Activity due to an error in the initial RFI&rsquo;s draft statement of work(SOW). In the revised draft SOW, attached to this amended RFI, the reference to a budget of 9.5 Million on page8 has been removed. We have removed the figure since we are looking for a realistic, ballpark figure or a range as part of our market research to help prepare our cost estimate. Please note that the figure in USAID&rsquo;s Business Forecast is only a place-holder and not indicative of this work.</div>

<div>Please send responses to this RFI via email to femini@usaid.gov and dhasani@usaid.gov with the subject title &ldquo;Response to USAID/Kosovo TEAM RFI&rdquo;, no later than the date/time stated above. You will receive an electronic confirmation acknowledging receipt of your response.</div>

The Government intends to issue a formal solicitation via an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in accordance with FAR Part 14, which will follow this announcement and will take place no sooner than 15 days from the publication of this announcement.</p>
<p>Solicitation plans and specifications will be made available for viewing and/or downloading on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website located at https://www.fbo.gov/ on or about February 18, 2016. It is the bidder's responsibility to check for any posted changes to the solicitation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction). The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000 average annual revenue. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price construction contract as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Project Description: This design-bid-build project is to repair and modern an existing pier at Kwajalein Atoll, and construct two new general purpose storage facilities and installation of infrastructure and utility systems. This project is in a remote location with a highly corrosive, hot, humid, and salt laden environment.</p>
<p>Pier work will include encapsulating a portion of the pier and filling the area, installing new piling, and installation of new decking. Work includes splash zone areas, repairs to existing berths, installation of new anchor rods, repair to pile caps, provide marine fenders, bollards and chocks, Antiterrorism/Force Protection measures, Energy Monitoring and Control Systems (EMCS) connections, and building information systems. Work also includes demolishing an existing general purpose storage facility. Supporting facilities includes utility systems supporting the pier (electric, potable water, non-potable water, fire water, sanitary sewer service, lighting, and communications) to include installation of new utility connections appropriate to each berthing location.</p>
<p>The estimated performance of period is 800 calendar days. Project magnitude is $40,000,000 to $60,000,000.</p>
<p>A pre-bid site investigation and pre-bid conference will be conducted by the Government at U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA), Republic of the Marshall Islands on March 3, 2016 and March 4, 2016, respectively.

<p>All planholders (prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers) are urged to attend. Due to limited logistical support, only one representative from each firm will be allowed to travel for the purposes of attending the pre-bid site investigation and conference. Representatives who plan to attend will need to contact Ms. Dayna Matsumura at dayna.n.matsumura@usace.army.mil and Ms. Jennifer Ko at Jennifer.I.Ko@usace.army.mil and provide a completed 55r and Food and Lodging worksheet by February 8, 2016.

BASIS OF AWARD:
This item will be procured under 38 USC  8123 which states: "The Secretary may procure prosthetic appliances and necessary services required in the fitting, supplying, and training and use of prosthetic appliances by purchase, manufacture, contract, or in such other manner as the Secretary may determine to be proper, without regard to any other provision of law."

SECURITY & PRIVACY CONTROL:

<DESC><p align="left">This action is a modification to contract FA8053-12-D-0015-E502 to exercise the extension of services clause FAR 52.217-8"Option to Extend Services." This is a firm-fixed price service. In accordance with the SAF/AQC policy memo, "Use of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services," an approved J&amp;A is required for contracts awarded prior to 20 August 2013 that did not establish extension prices at the time of contract award in order to satisfy FAR Part 6 requirements. This action is required to ensure there is no break in the existing services provided. Due to a delay in receipt of required documents necessary to re-compete this requirement it is in the Governments best interest to extend the existing contract utilizing FAR 52.217-8.</p>
