<CONTACT>Lee E. Smales, Phone 4022327367, Email smalesl@stratcom.mil
<DESC>The Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) is a web-based, collaborative Joint Operation Planning (JOP) tool that supports distributed participants in multiple security enclaves (primarily SIPRNET and JWICS at present). GAP CIE is comprised of two functional components supported by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software products: the GAP CIE planning environment, and the Global Situational Awareness Tool (GSAT). GSAT provides situational awareness of global events in a sharable, user-defined operational picture for viewing geospatial, temporal, relational, and COA planning data. GSAT allows a look at a battlespace and permits the visualization of real data from authoritative systems of record and other approved sources. The GAP CIE portion provides Deliberate Planning, Crisis Action Planning, and Decision Support tools. Both allow subject matter experts to share situational awareness and collaboratively build integrated, macro COAs. The system automates the construction of orders, messages, and status and decision briefs, freeing planners from format management and focusing their efforts on plan and information quality. The purpose of the GAP CIE Sustainment Program is to provide sustainment, enhancement, and modification deliveries to fielded Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) GAP CIE Block 1 and Increment 2 capabilities.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Reverse Auction:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;The Contracting officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offers, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NNG11PA03C with University of New Hampshire (UNH) Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission.  UNH is currently performing both the flight operations, which includes spacecraft operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations which includes initiating all target requests to the instrument, planning all instrument modes and turn-ons, data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS).  NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to UNH.  The estimated period of performance of this cost-no-fee (CNF) contract extension will be for 2-years from March 16, 2013 through March 15, 2015.  The UNH is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons:  Only UNH possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed design, test and operations knowledge of the CRaTER instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to integrate the CRaTER calibration, science operations and science data analysis. This is essential because the majority of the Instrument calibration and science operations flow from the science data analysis and require knowledge of both the Instrument science and Instrument design, test and operation. Similarly, the science data analysis is enhanced by direct knowledge of the Instrument science operations.  It would be unproductive to separate science operations from science data analysis.	UNH scientists and engineers are unique in their familiarity with the CRaTER instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft.  From 2005-2009, the UNH team (then resident at BU) designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the CRaTER instrument for the LRO spacecraft, including at the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO.  Under contract NNG05EB92C, the UNH team (while at BU and now UNH) has successfully carried out the science operations of the CRaTER instrument on the LRO spacecraft since LRO launch in June 2009.  PI Dr. Spence, now of UNH, as a leading expert in his field of space physics, was selected by NASA Headquarters to lead this investigation, based on an evaluation of his proposal submitted under the Announcement of Opportunity for exploration measurements in NASAs LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O).	The CRaTER instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument. In addition, UNH unique developed software for: checking telemetry received for health and safety of the instruments, processing the raw data so that scientists can manipulate, display, and analyze the scientific data received, and producing summary data.	This effort requires the detailed understanding of the instrument and all related software. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement. Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 5, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Southern Research Institute, 2000 9th Avenue, Birmingham, Alabama 35205-2708. The NINDS has a requirement for baseline and post-infusion assays of immunologic responses to a gene therapy agent for safety and efficacy determinations. The NINDS has a current protocol which infuses a gene therapy agent into the brains of subjects with Parkinson's disease. The trial is FDA-approved under IND 14,669. The FDA and Institutional Review Board (IRB) require assays of serum and cerebrospinal fluid for Anti-AAV2 antibody titers, GDNF protein levels, and anti-GDNF antibody levels. These assays are performed at baseline and at intervals up to five years following the gene therapy infusion, for a total of 10 timepoints per subject. Specifically, Southern Research Institute will develop the assays and provide instructions for shipment, run the screening serum anti-AAVA antibody on a weekly basis, and run the baseline and follow-serum GDNF level, serum GDNF antibody, CSF anti-AAV2 antibody, CSF GDNF level and CSF GDNF antibody in batches of &lt;30 or every six months, whichever comes first.
<p>Southern Research Institute is the only known source to provide specialized assays for gene therapy. In addition, Southern Research currently has experience in similar assays for non-human studies of gene therapy. The NINDS has a requirement for the development of the assays within 45 days or less. The patients have been recruited under the protocol.</p>
<p>The period of performance is one base year and up to four one-year option period(s.)<br /><br />Therefore based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements FAR 6.302-1. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI2790716 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price contract to The Boeing Company 4615 South Oliver Wichita KS 67210-1614, for engineering support services to update the configuration of the E-6B Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) Mercury aircraft Brake Collar Assembly, pursuant to the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Under the proposed contract, Boeing shall provide engineering services for investigating, analyzing, updating and documenting the E-6B Brake Collar assembly and defining the configuration. Boeing shall also provide engineering and logistics expertise to evaluate all technical and support requirements necessary to develop the configuration change of the Brake Collar assembly for manufacture, tracking, stocking repairing and dispositioning of the assembly.<br /><br />The Navy's E-6B aircraft is a derivative of the Boeing 707 commercial airliner. As the OEM, Boeing developed and procured all aircraft components for use on the aircraft and is the sole owner of the proprietary data used to design and build the aircraft. The Navy did not procure data rights for the aircraft components and depends on ongoing maintenance contracts with Boeing either directly or indirectly, to procure, repair or replace aircraft level assemblies. Since the 707 is an out of production aircraft, data only exists with the OEM to provide any updates necessary to integrate new technology with the legacy aircraft systems.
<p>A Solicitation is not available at this time. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency. Inquiries concerning this synopsis should be submitted IN WRITING via electronic mail to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Ryan Delaney, at ryan.delaney@navy.mil with a copy to the Procuring Contracting Officer, Mrs. Margaret Hayden-Stone, at margaret.hayden-ston@navy.mil.

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a contract with Parvus Corporation, 3222 S. Washington Street, UT 84115 for Power Supplies.  This will be a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for a min/max of 60/800 units over a five-year period.
The contract will be issued as a 5 year IDIQ Firm-Fixed Price contract with delivery terms of 30 days after contract award.
  Delivery will be FOB destination to NSWC Crane with inspection and acceptance at destination within 30 days of receipt.   
This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is that these Power Supplies are built specifically for the requirements of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.  Parvus is the manufacturer of the ACS-5161-50 Power Supply and the existing designs and drawings are their proprietary information.  Establishing alternative sources will result in unacceptable duplicative cost to validate the alternative Power Supply, including revalidate and possibly redesign the Next Generation Software Loader hardware and software to communicate and interface with the new unit.
  The new Power Supply would have to be exposed to environmental testing involving temperature and moisture in both operational and stored conditions.  Additionally, the new Power Supply would have to be retested for functionality on the aircraft, thus consuming valuable mission time for the aircraft and incurring considerable costs.
All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.

For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.
The solicitation will be available for download on or about DEC 13 2012.
  Closing date will be on or about JAN 15 2013.  The POC is Phillip Knight, Code CXMQ, telephone 812-854-8709, or e-mail phillip.knight1@navy.mil.  Reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation to be considered.  Submitting a bid from the NECO web site by clicking on the "Submit Bid" does not guarantee offers will be received by the proper person in the correct format.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Divisions intends to solicit competitive proposals for providing an Indefinite Delivery Requirements contract to fabricate and assemble approximately 130,500 Emergency Escape Breathing Devices (EEBD), 960 EEBD Training Units, and an EEBD Instructional Video with training materials.  The EEBD is designed to provide respiratory and eye protection in an atmosphere that will not support life.  The EEBD will be used by U.S. Navy personnel to provide breathing gas for escape from spaces aboard Navy ships where atmospheres are classified as Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH).  The primary use of the EEBD is for escape from a shipboard fire.  The EEBD will be either stored in a protective container or worn on the belt.
  Navy shipboard use will expose the EEBD to temperature extremes, rough handling, shock, vibration, X-RAYs, magnetic fields and other forms of electromagnetic radiation.  The EEBD shall be approved by the National Institute of Safety and Health (NIOSH) with a Cap 1 capacity rating as defined by Code of Federal Regulations Title 42 Part 84 and have a shelf-life of not less than 15 years.  NIOSH certification as well as third party testing of the EEBD shall be completed prior to submitting a proposal.  This will be explained in further detail in the Request for Proposal.  The EEBDs will be manufactured in accordance with the EEBD Specification provided with the contract solicitation.  The draft EEBD Specification is attached to this synopsis.
  

A Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Requirements contract with a 12 month base period and four one year option periods is contemplated.  A technical proposal is required. Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal is deemed to represent the best value to the Government considering technical merit and price.

<DESC>In 1951, Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) tasked the Office of the Chief of Engineers to develop a system to facilitate contingency construction planning and to serve as a guide to engineer field units in the Joint Operations Area (JOA). Later that year, the Engineer Functional Component System (EFCS) was developed which consisted of a set of standard facility designs that included bill of materials (BOM), planning data, and blueprint drawings.  This system was managed and supported at HQDA and remained the system until the early 1960's when it was renamed the Army Facilities Components System (AFCS). AFCS continued to be a manual system until the early 1970's when the information was entered into a mainframe computer in Washington DC with the drawings remaining in hard copy form. The BOM, planning data, and drawings were compiled into technical manuals. <br>  <br> With the need to access AFCS data by other organizations, the first automated version of AFCS was created in 1985. The Theater Army Construction Automated Planning System (TACAPS) was developed to provide a method for using current AFCS design and logistics master files in a remote location. TACAPS provided an automated method of identifying, maintaining, and disseminating information for construction planning in a Joint Operational Area (JOA) or for contingency situations. The automation of AFCS continued in 1990 with Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (CERL) being tasked to develop a version of AFCS that would run on a desktop computer. <br>  <br> Currently the Army is leading the effort to transition the Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) and the Theater Construction Management System (TCMS) into the Joint Construction Management System (JCMS). The transition to the JCMS will occur in May of 2013 per the 2012 Joint Engineer Work Plan for the Joint Chiefs of Staff J4 Engineer Division.  Engineer experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan have again highlighted the need to standardize contingency basing standards and designs across the Joint Engineer Community.  The use of multiple standards and designs for similar facilities creates inefficiencies in the use of resources and creates challenges for turning facilities over for contracted operations and maintenance.  Inconsistently applied master planning principles also led to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in our contingency bases.  Future operations will require each Service's Engineers to work together to meet all of the Engineer requirements.  The JCMS will provide a single system that all Services can use to plan and execute construction in support of the Joint Force Commanders.   <br>  <br> The transition from AFCS to JCMS includes the following major efforts: <br>  <br>  	Development of metric designs and a complete review and update to both existing AFCS designs and designs from Sister Services to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) for Non-Permanent Facilities in Support of Military Operations prior to integration into the JCMS database.   <br>  	Significant software programming upgrades to improve the functionality of the TCMS software, and to ensure interoperability with existing commercial construction management and design software and Service specific logistical systems to streamline bill of material acquisition.   <br>  	Validation and approval that the AFCS software and data servers are fully compliant with DoD Information Assurance policies and regulations in order to migrate into the NETCOM domain. <br>  	Working with DLA and AMC to catalog metric construction materials and to develop the process by which the AFCS/JCMS material data is updated to reflect changes made within the Federal Logistics Database <br>  <br> The Office of the Chief of Engineers and the AFCS Program Manager require Contractor technical instruction support in order to educate the Department of Defense on aspects of the AFCS Program and to deliver a functional Joint Construction Management System set of instruction to the Joint Engineer Community.  The Contractor shall provide project management, labor, materials, supplies, transportation and all things necessary to provide technical instruction support, Program of Instruction (POI) Development and analytical services for JCMS transition.   <br>  <br> The Contractor Instruction Development Team (IDT) shall be required to provide support in the completion of training doctrine analysis, identification of stake holders, development of  training objectives, identification of appropriate requirements pursuant to delivery of  AFCS/JCMS training; develop AFCS/JCMS training modules; conduct instruction support; and execute technical assessments of AFCS/JCMS training for the AFCS to JCMS transition.  Work will be accomplished at the AFCS Facility, contractor facility or off site location.  <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2, this procurement will utilize full and open competition after exclusion of sources.  Specifically, this procurement will be 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns in accordance with FAR 6.206, which allows Contracting Officers to set-aside solicitations to fulfill the statutory requirements relating to the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f).  The associated NAICS code is 541611 for Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services and the size standard is $14.0 Million.  Only proposals submitted by qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns will be accepted by the Government.  Any proposal submitted by a contractor that is not a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concern will not be considered for award. <br>  <br> The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Contract for a period of one (1) year with two(2) one(1) year options. The contracting office will not be notifying offeror's when the solicitation is released. It is the Offeror's responsibility to watch FedBizOpps for the solicitation. Anticipated release date of the RFP will be on or about 7 December 2012. A proposal will be due 30 days from the release date unless an amendment is issued to extend.

<DESC>1. The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Division of Capabilities and Assessments (XPZ), Patrick Air Force Base, Florida is seeking information from interested parties capable of developing options for an optimal system of a hardware mounting system for air sampling pods capable of satisfying National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) requirements.
<p>2. A flight certified hardware mounting system (HMS) for a C-130 aircraft which consists of a door and an articulating arm capable of supporting a 425lb sensor pod on each side of the aircraft, fully loaded to maximum limit the arm, door, and pod will weigh no more than 800lbs per side. Two people will need to be able to install the HMS components on the host aircraft. All HMS components need to be bolt on installation, no airframe modifications. HMS components cannot block the aircraft cargo movement area and the aircraft will remain pressurized in flight. All HMS components will be fully operational whether the aircraft is either pressurized or not. HMS components will not interfere with loading, unloading, air drop, paratroop static line, or container transport at pallet position no. 5. HMS components will have little or no effect on existing flight operations when installed. When the HMS arm is fully extended, the sensor pod is below the aircraft fuselage by approximately 24" and the arm will take about 1 minute to deploy or retract. The HMS arm needs twin electrical drives and two independent manual retraction systems to provide four way redundancy. The HMS arm strut needs to be electrically operated and utilize power from the missile support power receptacle. The goal of this RFI is the identification of sources for the development of an effective flight certified hardware mounting system for air sample collection pod which consists of a door and an articulating arm capable of supporting a 425lb sensor pod on each side of the aircraft and capable of meeting the listed requirements above.</p>
<p>3. Response Information: This RFI is being conducted for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a request for proposal or a request for quote. Information contained in this RFI is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with a submission in response. The information received will be considered for the purposes of market research.</p>
<p>4. This RFI is unrestricted and encourages responses from all responsible contractors independent of size.</p>
<p>5. All responses are to be provided electronically in Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format. Unclassified responses are preferred; however if there is a need for classified transmittals please contact the points of contact below. Responses are due by 1630 EST on 28 January 2013. Technical and contracting questions should be sent to Ms. Holly Johnson.</p>
<p>6. Submissions on RFI should be sent to the contracting point of contact: Ms. Holly Johnson, AF ISR Agency/A7KR, (321) 494-8354, holly.johnson.6@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey to update potential sources for the production and support of the Tactical Signal Payload (TSP) for the MQ-1C, Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) received in response to the 16 Apr 12 Market Survey. The purpose of this market survey is to support the development of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) acquisition approach to provide a TSP capability to the field leveraging the T-Pod Quick Reaction Capability and the TSP EMD programs. The intent of this survey is to identify potential sources for a system that is fully qualified to operate on the MQ-1C, Gray Eagle, a system that DOES NOT require any design/development or integration activities, except for modification of the pod interface to the Gray Eagle, and the ability of the hardware (airborne pod and Ground Workstation) to be software upgradable to the software being developed under the current TSP EMD Contract. The Government does not possess a technical data package for the T-Pod QRC or the TSP EMD programs.   <br>  <br> The TSP system improves the situational awareness of the supported Commander. The system provides the supported unit with a comprehensive picture of electronic emitter within the operating environment and the ability to detect, identify, locate, and copy emitters, including High Value Targets (HVTs). The TSP consists of a SIGINT system in an airborne pod and a Ground Workstation (GWS). The pod will be mounted on the right inner pylon mount on the right wing of the Gray Eagle, and the GWS will be located in a secured location separated from the Gray Eagle One System Ground Control Station (OSGCS). The airborne pod performs electronic emitter detection, identification, direction finding, and copy; transmitting encrypted via Gray Eagle through OSGCS to the GWS. The GWS provides warfighter machine interface (WMI) for payload command and control, performs emitter mapping and geo-location, displays data to the operator and interfaces to external networks for external consumption.  TSP system capabilities can be found in the TSP Technical Capability Document. <br>  <br> The system delivery requirements are to commence 12 months after receipt of order with delivery completed 12 months after first delivery. The total estimated quantity of 28 systems is spread over 2 lots with contract award anticipated in the 3rd Qtr FY13: <br> Lot 1: 12  <br> Lot 2: 16 <br>  <br> Any potential sources will require a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) properly accredited facilities with adequate TS/SCI cleared personnel to manage and produce TSP systems.  The facilities shall be Army accredited or have an ability to get a co-use utilization agreement in place with existing accreditor.   <br>  <br> Suppliers capable of providing the required production system and support services must indicate in writing to: <br> PM ARES <br> ATTN: Paul Yao (Paul.Yao@us.army.mil) <br> Building 6006 <br> Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005  <br>  <br> The responses must include documentation such as drawings, qualification test results and other technical information demonstrating that the supplier can provide the required hardware, software and services.  The deadline for responses is Dec 07, 2012.   <br>  <br> The TSP Technical Capabilities Document can be obtained from Mr. Kahraman Koseoglu, 443-861-0722, Kahraman.Koseoglu@us.army.mil.  <br>  <br> Unclassified/FOUO responses can be sent to Mr. Kahraman Koseoglu, I2WD, Attn: RDER-IWG-IF / Kahraman Koseoglu, 6003 Combat Drive, APG, MD 21005.  <br> Please do not send classified information through unclassified email system.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The US Army Project Manager Airborne Reconnaissance and Exploitation Systems (PM ARES), in support of Product Director, Tactical SIGINT Payload (PD, TSP/T-POD) is conducting a market survey to identify additional capable firms and products to support the current Traveler Pod (TPOD) system.  To perform this type of effort, replying firms are required to have a US Top Secret Facility Clearance with TS/SCI Safeguarding approvals to match the performance requirements. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain comments on preliminary requirement specifications - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. The lack of the submission of data at this time will not eliminate any firms' participation in the future competition, if such a competitive contract is assessed as possible by the Government through its evaluation of information obtained though this market research.   <br>  <br> The T-POD system is divided into 2 components; the T-POD airborne payload and the ground workstation. The T-POD airborne payload includes antennas, electronics, Global Positioning System /Inertial Navigation System, and crypto devices housed in a modified Standard Payload Interface Design and Integration (SPIDI) pod shell.  The T-POD requires power and datalink interfaces with the aircraft.  The pod will interface to the aircraft Ku band datalink architecture to provide for downlink of payload products and uplink of payload command/control.  The ground workstation provides the command and control for the payload and the receiving, display and exploitation of the SIGINT data collected.  The Government does not possess a technical data package or training material for the T-Pod system.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager- Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) seeks a holster for the M320 Grenade Launcher (M320GL) for use in the Stand Alone configuration (not mounted to the weapon). The attributes sought are configuration modularity, with the holster system capable of being quickly transferred and also worn on the hip, thigh, on Modular Lightweight Load Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) load carriage equipment such as rucksacks and the Tactical Assault Panel (TAP), and on individual body armor such as the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) or the Soldier Plate Carrier System (SPCS). This M320GL Holster RFI will be used to determine if alternate solutions are currently available and the impact such a holster might have on future procurement efforts without creating a burdensome logistical requirement. This RFI requests capability statements from companies for the purpose of identifying potential sources that have designs they believe will assist the Army in identifying and evaluating a M320GL Holster in all configurations and with the modularity as described above. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI is being issued in preparation for an anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) for an M320GL Holster system in multiple configurations and with the modularity as described above. Due to the time constraints, respondents must have a mature design in order to be considered as a potential source for this effort.
<p>The required characteristics of this M320GL Holster system:</p>
<p>1. Required Characteristics: (T=Threshold, O=Objective)</p>
<p>a. The M320GL-H size/footprint shall allow for a secure and accessible means to carry the M320GL and Soldier-configurable, simultaneous carry of other mission critical items/equipment.</p>
<p>b. The GLH shall allow for multiple (e.g., waist, torso, thigh, assault pack, etc.) carry configuration(s) options.</p>
<p>c. The GLH shall have two means of retaining the M320.</p>
<p>d. The GLH shall possess sufficient ruggedness to withstand military use.</p>
<p>e. The GLH shall provide a lanyard for weapon retention (T). The lanyard shall not hinder engagement of targets (T=O). The lanyard and/or lanyard attaching points shall allow rapid separation of the weapon from the user under emergency conditions. Weapon Lanyard shall provide stability for firing the M320 without the buttstock attached (O). Accuracy must equal or exceed the current (buttstock configuration) system to the maximum effective range of the M320.</p>
<p>f. The GLH shall be compatible with the MOLLE attachment system.</p>
<p>g. Operation of the GLH shall be compatible with combat clothing (including body armor, with and w/o plates, chemical PPE, wet/cold weather clothing, both day and night).</p>
<p>h. The GLH shall provide for reduced visual detection via a neutral non-reflective, non-black color (e.g., tan, gray-green, gray, taupe, Flat Dark Earth, etc.)</p>
<p>i. The M320GL-H system must be fully compliant with the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity (DMA) Contracting Office is seeking sources to perform layout, design, production, branding and research services to produce the United States Marine Corps' flagship magazine and digital products. This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified companies capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is an announcement seeking market information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), the Government may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP); however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g., large business, small business, service-disabled, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511 with a size standard of $25.5 million.
<p>A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and a list of Core Competencies the Government feels is essential to successful performance are attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the Defense Media Activity and the respondent's potential ability to meet DMA's requirement. The purpose of this notice is to identify interested vendors - large businesses, small businesses, 8(a), Veteran Owned, etc., and to determine if competition is available and if a set-aside is warranted. Responses should speak to the ability to perform the requirements contained in the PWS and provide evidence of successful experience regarding the core competencies.</p>
<p>The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. At a minimum, provide the following information in your submittal: (1) Name of company; (2) Name of company's POC, including address, phone, and email; (3) Identify the type of entity (large business, small business, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, 8(a), HUBZone, service disabled veteran-owned, etc,), (4) Identify intent to team, and if possible, the anticipated teaming arrangement. Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 and FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. In addition, the statement of qualifications should include information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements contained in the draft Performance Work Statement.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE only. 

This notice is a market survey for the VA Medical Center in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.  This government agency is in search of qualified, technically capable Service-disabled Veteran Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small businesses concerns for a pending requirement.  It is being presented to determine if there are two (2) or more capable Small Businesses that can perform the requirements for an anticipated Multiple Award Construction Task Order (MATOC) for construction, maintenance and repair of assets at the VA Medical Center.  Responses to this notice will be used for information and planning purposes only.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice.  All capable Small Businesses should respond with relevant information as indicated below in order to assist the Government in determining in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) if a set aside is required.  If sources are identified, this requirement will be set aside as IAW VAAR Part 819.  

All respondents to this notice are further advised that all solicited concerns will have their ownership/control verified through the Vendor Information Pages Database at URL:  http://www.VetBiz.gov before a contract is awarded.   

The anticipated contract will include a base year plus four (4) option years and will be awarded as a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  It is expected that there will be a minimum of eight (8) base contracts using the NAICS Codes shown below.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC Controls, fire suppression, and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, design/build and other related work. Projects will principally be design/bid/build type from already completed designs, or projects specified by a statement of work using the VA Master Specifications which may or may not include design build.  Because of the   number of NAICS Codes incorporated some offering may include some design/build projects and other may not.  Accordingly, the award of design/build task order will be restricted to companies having a past performance and technical capabilities for performing design/build projects.  Contractor can qualify for a base contract without submitting a proposal for a design/build project.

 The value for each Task Order is a minimum of $3,000 and maximum of $5,000,000.  The maximum value of any Task Order shall not exceed $33.5 million over the life of the contract.  The total contract value is anticipated to have an aggregate total this will not exceed $60 million. If no task order project is awarded the $3,000 minimum value for a one (1) task order will be paid to the holder of a base contract.  The minimum fee will only be paid if the awarded contractor continues to submit valid proposals - competes for, but is not awarded a task order throughout the life of the contract.  If a contractor is not awarded all option years as a result of a contractor failing to submit proposals or as a result of poor past performance on previous task orders, the contractor will not be entitled to the minimum guarantee.  The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award construction contracts within the activities covered by the proposed MATOC contracts to contractors other than those awarded a contract under this solicitation.  This is not a requirements contract.      



Each task order will be individually priced and have its own wage determination.    


It is anticipated that this requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 15 & 36 and will utilize a Tradeoff strategy with Past Performance and Technical Capability being weighted equally and when combined will be considered significantly more important than price.  The government expects this strategy to ensure that a Best Value Acquisition is obtained for this requirement.  Each Task Order will be competed individually based on the assigned NAICS for a requirement.  All concerns with awarded contracts for the MATOC will compete for the requirement.    

The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes and applicable size standards are as follows:  
  
Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors 	$14.0 M                238210 

Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors 	$14.0 M                238220

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD), and the NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) Climate Program Office (CPO) have a requirement for a 5-minute video to communicate in a public-friendly manner the climate science, data, and information products that the agency provides to the public, policy leaders, and stakeholder communities. Specifically, the video should focus on the ways in which NOAA's science, data and information products are used to help scientists and the public understand the causes and effects of extreme event-caused by weather, climate, and environment-and ways in which the agency's expertise and resources can be used to help communities prepare for natural disasters so that they are less vulnerable and more resilient. The video is being produced to be featured in the January 2013 annual conference of the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) in Washington, D.C. The theme for that conference is "Disasters and Environment: Science, Preparedness &amp; Resilience."
<p>All assets for this video shall be video recorded, produced, and formatted in high-definition, and delivered to NOAA CPO in a publication-ready format prior to December 31, 2012. The contractor, WebsEdge Ltd. is being selected as a sole source contractor due to their unique contract status with NCSE. WebsEdge has sole and exclusive rights to produce and transmit video content at the NCSE conference and so it is the only contractor authorized to produce and display a NOAA video in this event.</p>
<p>The contractor will collect video footage for production, and deliver to CPO a 5-minute feature video. The work will include two days of filming with the film crew on up to two separate locations to capture the required interviews, visuals, comments, testimonial and case study material, plus 1or 2 additional interviews at WebsEdge Ltd.'s Washington, D.C. production office. All video will be shot in Full High Definition format. NOAA CPO will retain the rights to all assets produced and delivered by WebsEdge Ltd. so that the CPO has unlimited ability to repurpose, repackage, and republish any or all of these materials.</p>
<p>The intended procurement is for services for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). However, all proposals received by 3:00 PM Tuesday, November 27, 2012 will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to WebsEdge Ltd., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this type of service. Such information shall include at a minimum: name, telephone numbers of firms to whom this service or similar service have been previously provided. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability by sending an email message referencing the Requisition No. NRMT00001300235 to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov. Failure to provide the required information will deem your request non-responsive. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. The NAICS code for this action is 512110. Responses may be sent to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 757-664-3622 ATTN: Karen Christian.

<SUBJECT>RFI for Wiring Intermittent Fault Tester (WIFT) for V-22
<SOLNBR>N68335-13-RFI-0097
<RESPDATE>120512
<CONTACT>Jacquelyn B. Poston, Email jacquelyn.poston@navy.mil
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /><br /></span></strong>This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis for written information only. <strong>This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.<br /><br /></strong>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) requires a Wiring Intermittent Fault Tester (WIFT) to detect intermittent faults in US Marine Corps MV-22, US Air Force CV-22 and other aircraft wiring systems. This type of aircraft wiring fault has been identified as a major fleet-wide degrader of operational readiness for the V-22 aircraft community.<br />The following definitions relate specifically to this RFI.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></span></strong>Aircraft Wiring System:</span> The totality of parts, components and subsystems including connectors, contacts, metallic wire, shielding, braid, terminals, splices, and other items, materials and processes, purposefully designed, integrated and fabricated to provide the aircraft electrical and electronic interconnecting network . For this RFI, the aircraft wiring system does not include any fiber optic components or subsystems.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aircraft Wiring Faults:</span> Physical damage, degradation, or other anomalous condition, to any part(s), component(s), or subsystem(s) of the aircraft wiring system, that results in malfunctioning, degraded functioning, or termination of functionality of a portion of the aircraft wiring system.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fault Detection:</span> The ability to identify that a particular type of fault is present in the aircraft wiring system<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fault Isolation:</span> The ability to spatially locate a fault in an aircraft wiring system.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Persistent Faults:</span> Non-intermittent faults. The anomalies caused by these types of faults do not abruptly appear, disappear, or undergo large changes over time or with changes in state of the aircraft or aircraft wiring system (i.e. aircraft in flight, aircraft performing ground operations, or aircraft on the ground not operating). <br /><br />The primary physical cause of persistent faults is mechanical damage to the insulation on a wire or wires (chafe damage, cuts into the insulation, etc.) that result in the exposure of the metallic conductor to the environment. If this exposed metallic conductor is in continuous (persistent) anomalous contact with another conductor (i.e. another exposed conductor on a different chaffed wire, cable or wire harness assembly shields, aircraft components or aircraft structure), then a persistent short may result. Persistent faults can also be caused by breaks in electrical continuity of the conductors (i.e. opens) due to broken/cut wires. Fault detection for persistent faults is typically accomplished utilizing various electrical meters (i.e. ohmmeter, digital multi-meter (DMM)). Fault isolation for persistent faults is typically accomplished via troubleshooting techniques or by utilizing a time-domain reflectometer or similar tester.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intermittent Faults:</span> Non-persistent faults. The anomalies caused by these types of faults abruptly appear, disappear, or undergo large changes over time or with changes in state of the aircraft or aircraft wiring system (i.e. aircraft in flight, aircraft performing ground operations, or aircraft on the ground not operating). <br /><br />The primary physical cause of intermittent faults is mechanical damage to the insulation on a wire or wires (chafe damage, cuts into the insulation, etc.) that result in the exposure of the metallic conductor to the environment. If this exposed metallic conductor is in very close proximity (but not in continuous (persistent) contact) with another conductor (i.e. another exposed conductor on a different chaffed wire, cable or wire harness assembly shields, aircraft components or aircraft structure), then an intermittent short condition may arise when the damaged wire is subjected to environmental stimuli (i.e. aircraft flight dynamics, airframe vibration caused by the operation of the engines, temperature cycling). Similarly, an intermittent open condition can result if a conductor is damaged, but maintains electrical continuity during static conditions. However, when the aircraft is subject to flight conditions or other stimuli, the conductor may react in such a way that continuity is lost intermittently. The primary characteristic of intermittent faults is that they can manifest when the aircraft is subjected to the above mentioned environmental stimuli and that they can disappear when the aircraft is not operating and on the ground. Intermittent faults are unpredictable and therefore difficult to detect. Fault detection for intermittent faults is typically accomplished utilizing various high voltage meters (i.e. megohmmeter ("megger")). Fault isolation for intermittent faults is typically only accomplished via troubleshooting techniques. No electrical tester, able to reliably fault isolate intermittent faults, is known to be in service supporting any Department of Defense (DoD) aircraft weapon systems.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wiring Intermittent Fault Tester (WIFT):</span> Is an aircraft wiring system electrical tester that has the capability to reliably and accurately fault isolate and fault detect wiring intermittent faults at the flightline (Organizational) maintenance level in the US Navy and Marine Corps military aviation environment. The V-22 aircraft program is seeking to procure / develop such a tester in the near future.

<DESC>Intent Number: FA8601-13-T-0048 for Leading Edge
<p>The United States Air Force, LCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a sole source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of composite leading edge thermal test specimens for the Wright-Patterson AFB Air Force Research Laboratory, High Speed &amp; Space Structures Branch (AFRL/RQSH). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).</p>
<p>This Proposed procurement will be a sole source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 336413, Size Standard 1000 Employees.<br />The proposed source is Carbon-Carbon Advanced Technologies, Inc. 4704 Eden Rd, Kennedale, TX 76060. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />The Government's requirement is for the manufacture of composite leading edge thermal test specimens. The leading edge components build upon previous work with similar materials that included extensive extreme environment exposure evaluations. Correlating the test results from the new components to the previously obtained data is crucial. Carbon-Carbon Advanced Technologies, Inc is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>AFRL/RQSH believes that award to any other source would incur unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition. Currently, the base material has undergone extensive testing.</p>

Small Businesses are highly encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>Tentative details of the event are as follows:</p>
<p>Tentative Date: March 2013<br />Tentative Duration: 1 Day<br />Tentative Location: Dayton, Ohio<br />Tentative Agenda:<br />- Introduction to the Enterprise Sourcing Group mission<br />- Overview of Strategic Sourcing<br />- Role of Small Business and Optimal Teaming Arrangements<br />- AF Roofing Strategy Overview<br />- Draft RFP Review</p>
<p>To gauge interest and assist in planning, the AF requests your response to a brief questionnaire. Please click on the following link to initiate the questionnaire: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/roofing_conference">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/roofing_conference</a></p>

<DESC>This Special Notice W15QKN-13-Z-B002 shall replace the notice W15QKN-13-Z-B001 for DEMIL INDUSTRY DAY.
The amended item is as follows: Attachment "DEMIL OVERVIEW SLIDES" has been added.

The Office of the Product Manager Demilitarization and the Joint Munitions 
Command will co-sponsor and host an 
Industry Day for the identification of innovative ideas regarding the increased 
efficiency of ammunition demilitarization (DEMIL), primarily at Army depot 
installations. 

As Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA), the Army is responsible 
for the demilitarization of all fielded ammunition for the Military Services 
that is unserviceable, obsolete, or excessive to requirements. The DEMIL 
stockpile exceeds 600,000 tons and is projected to grow; stockpile reduction 
is a significant challenge. Demilitarization is the destruction and disposal 
of Defense items so that they cannot be used for further military purposes and 
their residual parts can be safely handled and disposed of by civilian society. 
Ammunition Demilitarization is conducted at Army Depots and certain commercial 
facilities through a variety of processes including, but not limited to closed 
disposal technologies, Open Burn / Open Detonation, thermal destruction, 
explosive fill extraction, and disassembly. 



The purpose of this Industry Day is to enable the commercial industry and the 
Army ammunition community to identify and discuss new and innovative ways of 
conducting ammunition demilitarization on Army Depot installations in an open 
forum. It will also explore the idea of public private partnerships at 
ammunition depots accomplishing demilitarization as a mechanism to encourage 
investment and increase efficiency in depot ammunition demilitarization 
operations. This meeting is designed to provide depot capabilities and 
locations of ammunition stocks slated for demilitarization to commercial 
industry and solicit industry ideas on options for cooperative demilitarization 
operations between commercial industry and government depots. The government 
will kick off this Industry Day with a detailed briefing highlighting the current 
Army Demilitarization Program to share information to spur discussion. 
These slides are anticipated to be shared on this site on or around November 14, 2012. 
Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions during Industry Day, and those 
questions will be answered as time permits. Any unanswered questions will be 
posted as an attachment to this notice on or about one (1) week following the event. 
All information discussed at Industry Day will be unclassified. All media and 
recording devices, including cellular smart phones, will not be allowed. 


Industry is cordially invited to attend the Industry Day to be held: 
Date: 28 November 2012 
Time: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM 
Location: Cannon Gates Business Center, 121 Buffington Road, Picatinny Arsenal, 
NJ 07806-5000 


The Government will accommodate Industry requested One-on-One sessions on 29 
November 2012. These one-on-one sessions will be unclassified. During these 
sessions industry will be permitted to ask questions about ammunition demilitarization 
and the depot efficiency initiative, or on any other information provided during 
the course of Industry Day. A limit of one session will be permitted per company. 
Each session will be limited to thirty (30) minutes in duration. Any non-proprietary

<DESC>This is not a request for quote and no solicitation is available.  This is a notice of the government's intent to extend the period of performance of contract W9124D-08-F-0131 for the continuation of mission critical Information Technology services for the United States Army Human Resources Command. <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command(MICC)- Fort Knox intends to exercise Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52-217-8, Option to Extend Services to extend the performance period of contract W9124D-08-F-0131 issued to Akamai Technologies Inc. <br>  <br> The current period of performance with no additional services will be extended from 01 December 2012 to 31 May 2013.  The contract is for the GoArmy.com program and provides a worldwide network of internet servers and data warehouses that ensure GoArmy.com will perform optimally regardless of the number of simultaneous visits to the site.  The service relieves the Army of the need to purchase and maintain a network of hardware and internet server to accommodate millions of visitors. <br>  <br> Akamai Technologies, Inc. is the only source that can provide uninterrupted service with no degradation in support within the timeframe discussed above.  This service is vital to the continued operations of the IT infrastructure, business applications, and processes. If this extension is awarded to a new contractor, major disruptions will occur as the new contractor must provide these services within a very short period of time (beginning 01 December 2012).  This extension is necessary in order to maintain continuity of vital mission essential recurring services for information technology systems and business applications. <br>  <br> Any vendor who believes it is capable of meeting the MICC's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which will be considered only if received by 29 November 2012 by 1pm (EST).  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to catherine.l.padgett.civ@mail.mil by 1pm (EST) on 29 November 2012.  A determination not to compete the proposed modification based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Please note that any prospective offeror must be registered in the System for Award Mangement (SAM) system at www.sam.gov prior to award.  <br>  <br> Upon completion of the period of performance, it is the government's intent to compete the new requirement. <br>  <br>

NAEP is approaching its 45th anniversary as a mature program in a rapidly changing environment. It is incumbent on the program to maintain its historical role of reporting educational progress while at the same time accommodating and taking advantage of unprecedented changes in education and of rapid advances in technology. <br /><br />There are numerous factors that will influence NAEP during this period, many of which will be referenced throughout this Performance Work Statement (PWS). <br /><br />Examples include:<br />&bull; transition from a paper-and-pencil to technology-based assessment,<br />&bull; the emerging interest in international comparisons for states and districts, <br />&bull; advances in test development and new item types,<br />&bull; moving from a paper to an electronic environment, <br />&bull; development of measures of preparedness for post-secondary education and work,<br />&bull; adoption of common content standards by most states that may or may not align with NAEP content frameworks, <br />&bull; development of two separate common state-developed assessments based on those standards,<br />&bull; growth of out-of-school and technology-based learning by students, <br />&bull; growth of web-based reporting and social media, and <br />&bull; budget reductions throughout the education and assessment enterprises.
<p>NCES envisions this contract as vital to supporting a quality assessment and the program's transition to the future. There will have to be balance between the requirements specified herein and the on-going planning for the future of NAEP. NCES has undertaken several activities to develop a vision for NAEP 2020; those activities are documented at http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/future with their own knowledge of the future of large scale assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The pre-solicitation conference will be held as follows:</p>
<p>Date: December 3, 2012 <br />Time: 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time<br />Location: U.S. Department of Education<br />National Center for Education Statistics <br />1990 K Street, NW<br />8th Floor, Conference Room 1<br />Washington DC 20006</p>

<DESC>"This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes."
<p>PURPOSE<br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) requests information for a Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study among American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>On June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) was signed into law. This act gives broad authority to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enact or facilitate tobacco-product regulations, with the overall goals to (1) prevent Americans - especially youth - from starting to use tobacco; (2) encourage current users to quit; and (3) decrease the harms of tobacco product use.</p>
<p>In support of these mandates, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through NIDA, is partnering with FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) on a large-scale collaboration, the "Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health" or PATH Study. This landmark effort is aimed at establishing a scientific framework for FDA's development and implementation of near- and long-term tobacco-product regulations.</p>
<p>The PATH Study is a nationally representative study of tobacco use and health in the U.S. population. A cohort of approximately 59,000 adults and youth ages 12 years and older will be followed annually to assess attitudes and perceptions related to the use of different tobacco products; patterns and trends in use of existing and emerging tobacco products; knowledge of the contents of tobacco products and of the consequences of their use; and near- and longer-term health outcomes associated with tobacco product use. The study includes the collection of biospecimens (buccal cells, urine, and blood) among adults 18 years of age and older to examine intermediate endpoints and incident health outcomes associated with tobacco use and related disease processes.</p>
<p>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF A PATH STUDY AMONG AI/ANs<br /><br />Available national and regional data on tobacco product use suggest that rates of tobacco use and tobacco use-related morbidity and mortality are higher for AI/ANs than for any other minority groups in the U.S. These data are limited, however, especially regarding potentially important differences in initiation, prevalence, and consequences of tobacco use within the AI/AN population. Epidemiological data are needed to examine potential within-group differences among AI/ANs and any differences that may exist between AI/ANs and the general U.S. population. These data include geographic, social, and contextual factors (e.g., associated with reservations, or urban or rural areas), types of tobacco products used (e.g., smokeless and pipe tobacco, cigarettes), gender differences in product use, and cultural factors that may influence youth access, initiation behaviors, perceptions of risk, social norms, and attitudes about the use of tobacco.<br /><br />The nationally representative nature of the PATH Study suggests that relatively rare populations such as AI/ANs will only constitute a small percentage of the study cohort. The PATH Study estimates that fewer than 1,000 AI/ANs, including approximately 250 AI/AN tobacco users, will be recruited into the sample. This small number suggests that the national PATH Study will have gaps in its data on tobacco use and health among the AI/AN population. To address these data gaps, NIH, through NIDA, is issuing this request for information (RFI). The RFI solicits information that will help NIDA, with its FDA partner, make meaningful decisions regarding the feasibility, scope, costs, and magnitude of an initiative to address data gaps about the AI/AN population. A PATH Study among AI/ANs is envisioned to be modeled after the nationally representative PATH Study, but tailored specifically to the AI/AN population. At a minimum, such a study should provide longitudinal epidemiological data sufficient for making analytic comparisons among AI/ANs by geographic region, by urban or rural location, including by reservation, and by gender. It should also provide data on youth and adults. For additional information about the PATH Study, see http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=201208-0925-002.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>Information in the following areas will aid NIDA, in collaboration with its FDA partner, in evaluating the feasibility of conducting a PATH Study among AI/ANs. NIDA requests that interested organizations respond to the items listed below; information provided in response to this request need not be limited to these points. Respondents are requested to provide up to 3 ranked strategies (or scenarios) for the items below, categorizing these strategies by, for example, "acceptable, satisfactory, optimal," "low, medium, high," or "adequate, good, and the gold standard." Other ranking descriptors may also be used.</p>
<p>&bull; Project description and costs. Up to 3 ranked scenarios for conducting a PATH Study among AI/ANs, including its key components, i.e., the study design and the length of time required to develop the study design, sampling approach, and instruments; time for obtaining IRB/OMB approvals; requirements for hiring and training field workers/interviewers; requirements for constituency engagement; the timeline to recruit respondents and conduct the field test and to recruit the cohort for the baseline and at least 3 annual follow-up waves of data collection; plans to achieve high cohort-retention and response rates; and estimated year-by-year costs corresponding to each component for each of the three scenarios. Respondents are also requested to estimate costs (a rough estimate/not detailed) for each scenario to maintain the study cohort over time in the event the follow-up waves are other than annual (e.g., biennial).</p>
<p>&bull; Sampling approach, sample size, and population coverage. Estimates of the population sample size/s needed to achieve an average relative standard error of five percent with sufficient power to stratify analyses by 3 major domains (geographic region, urban/rural contexts, gender). These estimates may include other key attributes of interest, such as tobacco-use status (current, former, never), type of tobacco product(s) used, age, and other characteristics. Given that AI/ANs are widely dispersed in the U.S., a major challenge will be to identify and recruit AI/ANs to participate in such a study. This challenge underscores the need for study designs that are highly innovative, efficient, and to the extent possible, evidence-based.</p>
<p><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of either NIDA or its FDA partner. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIDA's use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NIDA's evaluation of the information received. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information as either part of the evaluation process or for the development of specifications of a subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Veteran-owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization.</p>
<p>"<strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes</strong>. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s)."</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole-source contract with the North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center to provide conference space in support of the annual NRC awards ceremony meeting to be held on May 9, 2013.
<p>The objective of the awards ceremony is to provide a forum for the Chairman and Commissioners to recognize NRC employee accomplishments this past year. The NRC requires the services of a hotel and conference center within close proximity to NRC headquarters (HQ) to allow timely access for employees. To ensure NRC employee participation, the awards ceremony must be held within walking distance from the NRC Headquarters, located at 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-2738. Historical data has shown that by holding the meeting at a facility within walking distance from NRC HQ, employees will save an estimated 35 minutes per day (approximately $13,440 per day in cost savings to the NRC) compared with traveling to a facility that is not within walking distance. Furthermore, transportation (i.e., shuttle buses, metro fare cards) for NRC employees to attend the meeting at a farther location would add considerable costs to the NRC. NRC will save approximately $49,500 in shuttle bus or approximately $13,500 in metro fare card costs.</p>
<p>The North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center is the only conference center that is located within walking distance from the NRC HQ that has the capacity to accommodate approximately 420 attendees for the meeting. The Marriott is located approximately 0.2 miles from NRC HQ and has extensive familiarity with NRC's security and meeting requirements as demonstrated by performing the annual Regulatory Information Conference in 2012, NRR All-Hands Meeting, the Integrated Regulatory Review Service Mission, and several other agency-wide and office-wide meetings. Therefore, the Marriott is the only conference facility that can meet NRC requirements in support of the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 13.106-1(b)(1) Only one responsible source</p>

It is amended to read: Submit signed and dated offer to Shanickiau Fowler email shanickiau.fowler@altus.af.mil and Lori Clinton lori.clinton@altus.af.mi no later than noon CDT, 6 Dec 2012. Bidder must attach pricing to the excel spreadsheet titled "Attachment 2: Bid Sheet).</p>
<p>--52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items:<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1. This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures. For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between past performance and price will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>2. Offeror shall propose on all Contract Line Item Number (CLINs) 0001 thru 0009, 1001 thru 1009, 2001 thru 2009, 3001 thru 3009, and 4001 thru 4009, via attachment labeled "Attachment 2: Bid Schedule". Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.<br />3. Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>4. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price: Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the schedule by the proposed unit price for each CLIN to confirm the extended amount for each. All CLIN extended amounts for the base and all options years will be totaled for evaluation purposes. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness subject to the processes described in paragraphs d, e and f. Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate, if applicable.</p>
<p>b. Technically acceptable: technically acceptable will be defined for this solicitation for washers as all washers used on this contract must be listed on the Energy Star commercial washers list located at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=clotheswash.display_commercial_cw.<br />Technically acceptable for the dryers must be commercial grade deemed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>c. Past Performance: The contracting officer will seek relevant and recent (within the past 3 years) performance information on all technically acceptable offerors based on (1) references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. "Past Performance Survey" attachment 3 will be used to obtain present and past performance information. Relevant information includes performance of work efforts involving lease and maintenance of washers and dryers.</p>
<p>The offeror shall send the "Past Performance Survey" to a minimum of three references but no more than five overall. If more than five past performance surveys are received prior to the solicitation due date, the first five received by the Contracting Officer will be used to assess past performance. Additionally, if less than three references are submitted by the solicitation due date an "unknown confidence rating" will be given.</p>
<p>The offeror not the government is responsible for ensuring their references complete the "Past Performance Survey" and send the survey directly to the 97th Contracting Squadron, Altus AFB, OK before proposal submission deadline. A minimum of three references shall be received but no more than five overall.<br />The offeror shall complete one each of the attachment labeled "Reference Sheet" for each reference and submit at least a minimum of three reference sheets but no more than five overall to the 97th Contracting Office, Altus AFB, OK before the proposal submission deadline.</p>
<p>The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall confidence assessment rating of exceptional (blue), satisfactory (green), marginal (yellow), or unsatisfactory (red). Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive an "unknown confidence" rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. However, a rating other than unknown confidence may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing, a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts. When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond.<br /><br />RATING DEFINITION<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br />d. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and is judged to have an overall substantial confidence performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated substantial confidence, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated substantial confidence for past performance. An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be the most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria. If no proposals are rated substantial confidence, an integrated assessment will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror determined to be the most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.<br />e. If a lower priced technically acceptable offer is determined to have an unreasonable discussions may be required.<br />f. The contracting officer may determine at any point in the process to open discussions. If the contracting officer determines discussions are necessary, all offerors will be evaluated on past performance and price. The competitive range may then be limited to the number of proposals that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offers. Discussions will be conducted, Final Proposal Revisions requested, and the source selection authority will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />g. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.<br />h. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Clarifications conducted to resolve relevance of the past performance information, adverse past performance information, or minor clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br />i. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Therefore, each initial offer must address information in accordance with the paragraphs above and should contain the offerors's best price and past performance reference list. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>Past Performance submissions will be rated for relevancy using the below chart.</p>
<p>Very Relevant Present/past performance efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this RFP. <br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. <br />Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires. <br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> (i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> 	(ii)  The solicitation number is W911QX-13-R-0001.  This acquisition is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) <br>  <br> 	(iii)  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61 <br>  <br> 	(iv)  This acquisition is a small business set-aside .  The associated NAICS code is 334516.  The business size standard is 500. <br>  <br> 	(v)   The following is a list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure:   <br>  <br> CLIN 0001  The Government requires one (1) BRAND NAME OR EQUAL Asylum Cypher Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) System with Cypher SPM Standard Scanner and Approach Module, Cypher SPM Standard View Module, Cypher SPM MultiLux Standard Source Module, Cypher MultiLux Standard Super Luminescent Diode (SLD) Source Module, Amplitude Modulation/Frequency Modulation (AMFM) High Frequency Cantilever Holder Version 2 Kit, Cypher ORCA Conductive AFM Cantilever Holder Kit, Ztherm Cantilever Holder Kit, STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) Probe Holder, and Air Temperature Control (ATC), in accordance with the following Salient Characteristics. <br>  <br> (vi) Specifications / Salient Characteristics / Statement of Work:   <br>  <br> Precision, accuracy and resolution  <br> Instrument resolution  <br>  	The instrument must achieve atomic lattice resolution in air in DYNAMIC mode. <br>  	The instrument must achieve true atomic resolution (defined as repeated point defect resolution) in liquid in DYNAMIC mode. <br>  <br> Instrument geometry <br>  	The microscope must be a sample scanning system with the cantilever fixed in the laboratory frame.

The software must include digital zoom, pan and capture, as well as balance, shutter speed and binning. <br>  <br> Instrument isolation <br>  	The instrument must include an integrated thermally- and acoustically-isolating enclosure. Enclosure must provide at least 20 decibels (dB) of acoustic isolation. <br>  	The microscope must have integrated passive vibration isolation. The damping must be sufficient to allow open- and closed-loop atomic-scale imaging resolution in labs with floor accelerations  less than 1mm/s2. <br>  	The integrated enclosure must be actively temperature-controlled to 0.10Celcuis (C). <br>  <br> Controller and electronics <br>  	The AFM control electronics must provide 100% digital operation. <br>  	The electronics must include digitally-controlled switches for user-defined signal routing. <br>  	The system must provide thermal tunes of the cantilever up to at least 7MHz. <br>  	The instrument must allow digital quality (Q)-control in the range 2kHz - 20MHz. <br>  	The instrument must include software controlled relays for the X, Y and Z high voltage supplies and the laser power. <br>  	The controller must include the following features: <br> o	Floating point digital signal processor (DSP) running at 80MHz and Dual-core NIOS in field programmable gate array (FPGA). <br> o	Four (4) Field Programmable Gate Arrays running at up to 667MHz. <br> o	Two (2) dual frequency quadrature lock-in's at up to 20MHz and one dual-frequency quadrature lock-in at 5 MHz. <br> o	Sixteen (16) proportional-integral gain controllers <br> o	The electronics must provide the user with integrated external access to all input and output signals (e.g., via front- or rear-panel Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) connections). <br>  <br> Specific measurement and analysis modes: <br> Operating Modes <br>  	The microscope must be capable of the following scanning modes, each of which requires at minimum that the signals noted in the corresponding parentheses be recordable simultaneously.

<DESC>I. OVERVIEW: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. <br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>2852.223-70 UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS<br />Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)<br />(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.<br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.<br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.<br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended.

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>This solicitation contemplates a firm fixed award to one contractor only. Prospective quoters are encouraged to visit the site.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;DESCRIPTION OF WORK AREAS<br />Compound Access road: this is a &frac12; mile long gravel road with numerous driveways. The road is approximately 20' wide.</p>

<p>Yakutat USFS compound: the compound includes an access driveway that is approximately 400' long by 20' wide. The compound also includes a parking/work area bordered by a warehouse and bunkhouse approximately 150' x 200' in size. The compound area is gravel surfaced. The compound also includes a snow storage area located behind the warehouse. The area immediately next to the rear warehouse wall will require occasional clearing of snow accumulated from the warehouse shed roof.</p>
<p>3 SNOW REMOVAL REQUIREMENTS<br />Remove snow from the project roads and the compound Area A when snow depth exceeds 6". The Contractor shall exercise good judgment during times of snowfall or storms so that duplication of plowing efforts does not occur. When storms produce snow depths greater than 24" equitable adjustments in price may be negotiated.</p>
<p>Snow storage services at the USFS compound Area B will be required when snow piles in the compound areas become too large to work around, and/or when snow accumulation next to the warehouse rear wall exceeds 2' in depth. A snow storage area is located behind the warehouse.</p>
<p>Perform work in a manner to preserve and protect roads and appurtenances, and to prevent erosion damage to roads and streams. Do not blade gravel or other surfacing material off the road.<br />Keep roadbed drainage ditches, drain dips, and culverts functional during operations and upon completion of operations.</p>
<p>Control snow removal to identify the usable traveled way having roadbed support. Reshape over-width plowing as necessary to define the usable width.</p>
<p>Remove snow from all of the traveled way, including turnouts, for safe and efficient use for Contractor's equipment, government employees and the public.</p>
<p>Space, construct, and maintain drainage holes in the dike of snow or berm caused by snow removal operations. Place drain holes to obtain surface drainage without discharging on erodible fills.</p>
<p>Snow shall not be piled where it will block sight distance at roadway intersections or block roadways, garage bays or equipment bays or driveways.</p>
<p>Remove snow berms at driveway entrances caused by snow plowing operations.</p>
<p>Provide plowed parking areas for a minimum of 10 standard vehicles near Cannon Beach.</p>
<p>Government is responsible for coordinating and moving fleet and employee vehicles to allow for plowing and snow removal within the compound area. If fleet vehicles are not moved, plow roadway areas around them.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(b) Consistent with the requirements of Section 701 of Executive Order 13101, the Contractor shall establish a program to promote cost-effective waste reduction in all operations and facilities covered by this contract. The Contractor's programs shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local requirements, specifically including Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6962, et seq.) and implementing regulations (40 CFR part 247).
DIAP2010-14 Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (July 2010) a)  FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation.  One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 
	(b)  The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS.  CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report.  Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.
	(c)  We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award.  Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official.  The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.
	(d)  When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions.  Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.
	(e)  Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment.  Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22.  Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.  In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions.  If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form.  Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government.  If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date).  The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment."  Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.
	(f)  The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
        	(1)  Protect the evaluation as "source selection information."  After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS.  If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions.  
	(2)  Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization.  Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.
	(3)  Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.
	(g)  If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation.  The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.
    	(h)  A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.
DOI LOCAL CLAUSE IPP - Electronic Invoice and Payment Requirements - Internet Payment Platform Payment requests must be submitted electronically through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Internet Payment Platform System (IPP).

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) provides benefits, counseling and personnel services to NRC employees, which enhances the balance of work and family responsibilities and assists NRC in recruiting and retaining the skills necessary to accomplish its mission. As such, OCHCO plans, implements, and monitors a full range of employee benefits; plays an active leadership role in the development of new initiatives; and serves as an agency-wide clearinghouse for information on employee benefits and other related programs.
<p>Congress enacted Public Law 107-67 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), which permits Federal agencies to assist their lower income Federal employees with the costs of child care. This legislation allows Federal agencies to provide subsidies directly to the child care provider and thus, can reduce the amount of money that parents pay for childcare. To be eligible to participate in this program, child care provided must be a family child care home or child care center. Either type of care must be licensed and/or regulated by the State and/or local authorities where the service is provided.</p>
<p>The NRC has established a child care subsidy program. The NRC solicits proposals from qualified organizations which demonstrate the ability to administer the NRC's child care subsidy program.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999)<br />QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c. Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />d. Required completion date for the contract<br />e. Date the services were actually completed<br />f. Ship Name, Hull Number<br />g. Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />h. Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. <br />The information may be as follows: <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />Total for item _____________<br /><br />FAR 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) - VARIATION <br />The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BASIS OF AWARD:<br /></span><br />Quotes will be evaluated and award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to be the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA).<br /><br />FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY<br /></strong>In order to be considered for award, the offeror's proposal must be rated as acceptable.

The offeror's contractor experience will be evaluated based upon the demonstrated experience furniture purchase, delivery and installation.

Past performance beyond the five-year period as stated, will not be considered.<br /><br />&bull; Questionnaires submitted under Past Performance must be for work performed within the past five (5) years (measured from the date proposals are due). Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs are to be emailed directly to the Government point of contact Audreya J.P.

<p>&bull; While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.</p>
<p>Each offer will be evaluated to determine the degree to which past performance evaluations and all other past performance information reviewed by the Government reflect a trend of satisfactory performance considering a pattern of successful completion of tasks; pattern of deliverables that are timely and of good quality; pattern of cooperativeness and teamwork with the Government at all levels (task managers, contracting officers, auditors, etc.); tasks that are identical to, similar to, or related to the task at hand; and a respect for stewardship of Government funds.</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 3: PRICE<br /><br /></strong>Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation. Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable, responsible offeror.

<DESC>Questions and Answers - Ninth Round. Answers are in response to Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U Market Survey posted on 25 May 2012. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	Question- Good afternoon.  Just a couple quick questions- - we've reviewed the info on FBO and are very interested in submitting a proposal for this.  Can you advise if there will be a draft SOW with drawings in released in advance of the solicitation?  Also, do you have any thoughts on the schedule/timeframe for the RFP?. <br>  <br>  <br> Answer: Drawings and performance specifications are being released in advance of the solicitation. Please send your request to Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil.   <br>  <br> The draft Solicitation and Statement of Work (SOW) are anticipated to be released in December 2012. The actual solicitation release date will be approximately two weeks after the draft solicitation release date. <br>  <br> 2.	Question- Could you provide an update on this with regard to acquisition schedule and any set aside status? <br>  <br> Answer: Please see above answer to Question #1 concerning timeframe. In addition, this requirement remains a 100% small business set aside. <br>  <br>  <br> 3.	Question: To date, we have not submitted a formal bid via the www.fbo.gov website. We have enough information to move forward with a quotation and request UL for a quotation so we can include it as a line item. The lead time to get something UL Listed could be up to six months. <br> What are the next steps? How do I submit a bid for your consideration? Do you have any templates I can leverage? As mentioned, we would really like this opportunity. <br> Answer: The UL certification is not necessarily required. The vendor has an option of either receiving UL certification, or performing the prescribed tests as part of the First Article Testing and Group B.  <br>  <br> Per MIL-PRF-49080D paragraph 3.16.1 General Safety - The power supply shall be Listed to UL 60950-1 and bear the Listing mark. In lieu of the Listing, the power supply shall be tested per 4.9.1, 4.9.2, and 4.9.3 and meet the visual and mechanical requirements of UL 60950-1. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates the release of a Request For Proposal (RFP) for this requirement. The Government will also be utilizing Trade-Off (Best Value) source selection procedures for this requirement. Upon release of the solicitation it is advised that an offeror read Section L and Section M thoroughly to determine what is required to submit for a proposal. It will require more than a quote/bid.  <br>  <br> Furthermore, please keep checking FedBizOpps, www.fbo.gov, for updates. The drawings and performance specifications are currently being sent out upon request. <br>  <br> 4.	Question: We're very interested in this solicitation and am wondering if you can give me a status with regard to potential schedule and whether or not this will be a SB set aside. Also, will a draft of the drawing packages be released prior to the RFP? <br>  <br> Answer: Please see answers above to Question #1 and Question #2. <br>  <br>  <br> 5.	 Question: We are an interested vendor, and I have downloaded all files referencing subject sources sought notice. I do not, however, see my file for Q&A 7. Could you forward that file? <br>  <br> Answer: If you look on FedBizOpps on the left side under Complete View; it is the link entitled  quote mark changed quote mark  and dated August 30. <br>  <br> 6.	Question: The most recently posted attachment is title round 8, what happened to the other 7 rounds? <br>  <br> Answer: Please see above Answer to Question #5. All Q&As are in the same location under Complete View. <br>  <br>  <br> 7.	Question: Please let us know status as we are excited about this project. Our engineer is also asking for a timeline of when a quote is needed so he can start working on a preliminary design. <br>  <br> Answer: Please see above Answer to Question #1. <br>  <br>  <br> 8.	Question: I'm actually more interested in looking at and discussing other opps that are probably farther out than the TPS's. We don't have any other questions on TPS but, I am interested in getting your input with regard to what might be coming down the road in the future and who would be some appropriate technical/program people to speak with. <br>  <br> If you have any time next week, would certainly like to stop by and say hello. <br>  <br> Answer: I am the point of contact for Tactical Power Supplies only. I would recommend that you contact the CECOM Small Business Programs Office with your additional questions. <br>  <br> Please send your inquiry to: <br>  <br> Usarmy.APG.cecom.mbx.cecom-small-business@mail.mil <br>  <br> A Small Business Specialist will get back to you. <br>  <br> Also, in accordance with FAR 15.201(f) Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals:  <br>  <br>  quote mark General information about agency mission needs and future requirements may be disclosed at any time. After release of the solicitation, the contracting officer must be the focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offerors, that information must be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating and unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a potential offeror in response to its request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror's confidential business strategy, and is protected under 3.104 or subpart 24.2. When conducting a pre-solicitation or pre-proposal conference, materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all potential offerors, upon request. quote mark  <br>  <br> Moreover, in order to avoid an inadvertent release of information that could possibly create an unfair competitive advantage, the Contracting Officer is not able to meet with any of the interested sources to discuss Power Supplies, or any other program. <br>    <br> 9.	Question: The amendment that was posted on November 16th states  quote mark The Government intends to award a five-year with no options, Firm-Fixed-Price, (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, (IDIQ), non-commercial type contract as a Full and Open Competition action for Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U & PP-2953E/U. This requirement will be conducted on the basis of Small Business Set-Aside with single contract award in accordance with FAR 19.502-2. quote mark  <br>  <br> Will the Government be issuing a Full and Open Contract and a SB Set Aside Contract? <br>  <br> Answer: The Government will be issuing one contract for this requirement. The contract will be issued under Full and Open competition after the exclusion of sources; any small business concern under the small business size status for NAICS code 335999 can provide a proposal.   <br>  <br> According to FAR 19.502-2 (a) Before setting aside an acquisition under this paragraph, refer to 19.203(b). Each acquisition of supplies or services that has an anticipated dollar value exceeding $3,000 ($15,000 for acquisitions as described in 13.201(g)(1)), but not over $150,000, ($300,000 for acquisitions described in paragraph (1) of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold definition at 2.101), is automatically reserved exclusively for small business concerns and shall be set aside for small business unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. If the contracting officer does not proceed with the small business set-aside and purchases on an unrestricted basis, the contracting officer shall include in the contract file the reason for this unrestricted purchase. If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer from a responsible small business concern in response to a set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that firm. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, shall be re-solicited on an unrestricted basis. The small business reservation does not preclude the award of a contract as described in 19.203. <br>  <br> 10.	Question: After reviewing the pre-solicitation documentation regarding the Tactical Power Supplies we respectfully request for your consideration the addition of the Progress Payment FAR Clause 52.32-16 be included in the upcoming solicitation if that is at all possible. Thank you so much for your consideration and look forward to working with you. <br>  <br> Answer: The Contracting Officer may consider the inclusion of FAR 52.232-16, Progress Payments, for this Request For Proposal (RFP). A decision will be made at the time the official solicitation is released. <br>

<DESC><strong>AMENDMENT:&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is to identify the tentative award timeline for the follow-on competition and correct the response date.&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to increase the ceiling on the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE) Exercise Support Services IDIQ with Cubic Applications, Inc. (CAI) under contract HDTRA1-04-D-0020 under the authority set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). As a result of unanticipated increases in the quantity of Foreign Consequence Management (FCM), Nuclear Weapons Accident / Incident Exercise (NUWAIX) and Consequence Management Assistance Program (CMAP) events in FY13-14, the Government requires an increase in the ceiling of the IDIQ to ensure immediate and continued support of current and scheduled FCM/NUWAIX and CMAP efforts in FY13-14. This increase results in no change to the ordering period of the IDIQ which continues through July of 2014.<br /><br />As CAI has over eight years' experience in the planning, development, and execution of FCM/NUWAIX and CMAP efforts, only CAI possesses the in-depth knowledge and expertise required to plan, develop, and execute the current and scheduled FCM/NUWAIX and CMAP requirements. Further, as the current performer and executor of these highly specialized / niche counter CBRNE Exercise Support services, CAI is the only source capable of fulfilling the Government's requirements, cost and other factors considered.<strong> It should be noted that due to current and anticipated growth in this program, DTRA intends to re-compete this prior to expiration of the ordering period in January 2014.<br /></strong>&nbsp;
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Solicitation packages are not available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All responses shall include clear and convincing evidence of the vendor's ability to provide the required items/services given the facts and details identified above. All responses shall be submitted via email to the identified Government point of contact below no later than <strong>November 23, 2012 at 4:00 PM EST.</strong> Any and all responses received after this date will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered.</p>
<p>All inquiries and responses to this notice must be submitted to the attention of Ms. Deonna Reyes (Deonna.Reyes@dtra.mil), Contract Specialist or Mr. Daniel Vola (Daniel.Vola@dtra.mil), Contracting Officer. Responses shall include your business name, point of contact, address, business size (large, small, 8(a), etc.) and telephone number with area code. Telephone requests or inquiries shall not be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br /><strong>The solicitation number for the privatization of the Electric System, Water Distribution System, and Water Collection System at McConnell AFB, KS has changed.&nbsp; The new solictation number is SPE600-13-R-0806.&nbsp;&nbsp;All pertinent information regarding this procurement will be posted under the&nbsp;new solicitation number.<br /></strong></p>
<p><br /><br /><br />The contractor will be required to assume ownership of the utility system(s) at McConnell AFB and as the new system(s) owner shall operate and maintain the system(s) and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility system(s).</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 4:00 pm on Tuesday, July 5, 2011. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address: (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating electric, water, or wastewater utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business). The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the August 2011 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DLA Energy Contracting Office.</p>
<p>Installation Description</p>
<p>McConnell Air Force Base (AFB) is located six miles southeast of downtown Wichita, Kansas, in unincorporated Sedgwick County. Topeka, the state capital, is 140 miles northeast of the installation and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is 162 miles south of McConnell AFB. Interstate 35 provides a by-pass route east around Wichita, bordering McConnell AFB to the west and north. Rock Road runs north/south through the base and separates the main base from the housing area.</p>
<p>McConnell Electric Distribution System: <br />McConnell AFB receives electric power from Westar Energy at 12.47 kV at three separate service locations. The distribution system consists of approximately 526,795 single conductor linear feet (SCLF) of underground circuits (1986 - 2010 vintage). Also included are approximately 377,525 SCLF of street lighting wire, 570 steel/aluminum poles, 31 wood poles, 216 precast concrete manholes (1986 - 2010 vintage), 298 three-phase pad-mounted transformers ranging from 15 to 2000 kVA (1991 to 2010 vintage), 50 single-phase pad-mounted transformers ranging from 10 to 75 kVA (2003 to 2010 vintage), and 21 single-phase pole-mounted transformers ranging from 5 to 150 kVA (1991 to 1994 vintage).</p>
<p>McConnell Potable Water Distribution System: <br />The water utility system was originally constructed in the early 1950s. Water from the City of Wichita lines goes to the Base water treatment plant, where it is chlorinated and fluoridated. After treatment, water is pumped into a 1 million gallon ground storage tank and a 1 million gallon elevated storage tank. The distribution system consists of approximately 4,579 LF of asbestos pipe (1952 to 1963 vintage), 62,972 LF of steel pipe (1952 to 2008 vintage), and 122,628 LF of PVC pipe (1981 to 2010 vintage). Also included are approximately 230 fire hydrants (1980 to 2005 vintage), 5 post indicator valves (1988 to 2000 vintage), 424 gate/ball valves (1952 to 2010 vintage), and 12 backflow preventers (2002 to 2008 vintage).</p>
<p>McConnell Wastewater Collection System: <br />The wastewater system is a collection system only; there are no treatment facilities on base. Wastewater is pumped to the City of Wichita's system for treatment and ultimate disposal. The largest force main on the base is used to convey wastewater from the main pumping station, Building 1151, to the City's system. Construction of the main lift station was completed in 2006. The collection system consists of approximately 149,682 LF of PVC pipe (1955 to 2007 vintage) and 697 LF of vitrified clay pipe (1946 vintage). Also included are approximately 255 precast concrete manholes (1995 to 2009 vintage), 122 brick manholes (1946 vintage), 16 lift stations (1988 to 2008 vintage), and 1 generator.</p>
<p>Additional installation information may be located at: <br />http://www.mcconnell.af.mil/</p>
<br /><br /><br />Description<br />The DLA Energy Energy Enterprise Business Unit seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution system (NAICS 221122), the water distribution system (NAICS 221310), and the wastewater collection system (NAICS 221320) at McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), KS. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) has issed Modification 1 to the solicitation of two prospectuses for services at the Keller Ferry and Seven Bays Marinas located within Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The two prospectuses are for two different levels of service as well as two different term lengths for the same area and are described below.
-	Full service marina operation identified as "Full Service Draft Contract" includes houseboat and other boat rentals, moorage, retail/grocery, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Full Service Draft Contract is for a term of fifteen (15) years. -	Limited service marina operation identified as "Limited Service Draft Contract" includes moorage, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Limited Service Draft Contract is for a term of ten (10) years.
The Service is interested in maintaining an appropriate level of service on the south end of Lake Roosevelt and therefore have created the two prospectuses to help facilitate interest in bidding. However, if the Service receives a responsive offer, as that term is defined in 36 C.F.R. Part 51, for the Full Service Draft Contract, regardless of whether the Service receives a responsive offer for the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will cancel the Prospectus for the Limited Service Draft Contract before award and select a Concessioner for the Full Service Draft Contract. If the Service only receives a responsive bid to the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will select a concessioner for that Contract. In either case the final contract will be awarded under Concession Contract No. CC-LARO001-13.
Both Prospectuses and Modificaiton 1 which includes minor changes to documents found in both Prospectuses can be found electronically at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospetuses.htm or by contacting Kimberley Gagliolo, Commercial Services Specialist, at 415-623-2227 or via email at kim_gagliolo@nps.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-13-00023 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-55, effective February 2, 2012.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238220 - Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors, which has a size standard of $14.0 million, is applica ble.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for: 1) - the purchase, supply and installation of two high efficiency, condensing boilers, 2) - the installation of four (4) previously purchased Government furnished boilers, and 3) - the removal and disposal of existing boilers in accordance with the Statement of Work.  See the SF-18 (Attachment # 1) for a list of contract line items.  
A.  BACKGROUND - The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Western Ecology Division (WED) Plant Ecology Laboratory building in Corvallis is a one story structure with a mechanical penthouse constructed in 1984 and is served by two 750mbtu Burnham PF504.  Boiler #2 has been removed.  Rather than expending the cost of repair, EPA WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
EPA's WED Corvallis laboratory building is a two story structure constructed in 1966 and is served by two 3,000mbtu Hurst boilers.  Boiler #1 needs to be re-tubed.  Rather than expending the cost for repair, EPA's WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
The EPA WED's Newport Laboratory building was constructed in the 1994.  The original HVAC heating design utilized heat pumps and was replaced in 2005 with three hydronic natural gas fired boiler units that service the 38,000 sf main building.  These units are RBI model DB1500's each and are control automated.  The existing units reside in a small detached concrete block structure.  Because of the size of the existing horizontal units, it is not possible to remove a unit through the 48" door without first removing the center unit that blocks the door.  The current exhaust stack and piping will need to be isolated so that the remaining unit will continue to provide service.  Contractor shall ensure that the remaining boiler in the Newport facility provides heating and shall also provide a temporary boiler for heating until the new units are fully functional and can provide heating.  
B.  SCOPE - Boiler replacement and installations at US EPA's Western Ecology Division (WED) requires installation at two locations and in three separate buildings.  This project is to supply two (2) 1,000mbtu high efficiency condensing boilers for the Plant Ecology Building.  This project is also to install and commission a total of six (6) boilers: 1) - Two (2) Lochinvar Crest FBN 2000 Government Furnish Equipment (GFE), 2) - Two (2) Lochinvar Crest FBN 1500 boilers Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and 3) - Two (2) 1,000mbtu high efficient condensing boilers that shall be purchased and supplied by the contractor.  This project also includes the removal and disposal of: one existing boiler at the EPA WED's Plant Ecology Building; two boilers at the EPA WED's Corvallis Laboratory facility; and two boilers at the EPA WED's Newport Laboratory facility.  Lastly, the project requires commissioning and testing of all six boilers as required by Oregon State Code.  See Attachmen t # 3, Statement of Work, for the full scope of work for this requirement, Government and contractor responsibilities, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and the projected period of performance.  See Attachment # 4 for facilities & boiler sheets and floor plans.    
C.  TERMS AND CONDITIONS - The Statement of Work (SOW), Evaluation Criteria, Pricing Sheet and any other information pertaining to this requirement can only be found at the EPA website listed at the end of this synopsis/solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-13-00023 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-55, effective February 2, 2012.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238220 - Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors, which has a size standard of $14.0 million, is applica ble.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for: 1) - the purchase, supply and installation of two high efficiency, condensing boilers, 2) - the installation of four (4) previously purchased Government furnished boilers, and 3) - the removal and disposal of existing boilers in accordance with the Statement of Work.  See the SF-18 (Attachment # 1) for a list of contract line items.  
A.  BACKGROUND - The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Western Ecology Division (WED) Plant Ecology Laboratory building in Corvallis is a one story structure with a mechanical penthouse constructed in 1984 and is served by two 750mbtu Burnham PF504.  Boiler #2 has been removed.  Rather than expending the cost of repair, EPA WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
EPA's WED Corvallis laboratory building is a two story structure constructed in 1966 and is served by two 3,000mbtu Hurst boilers.  Boiler #1 needs to be re-tubed.  Rather than expending the cost for repair, EPA's WED has elected for replacement with high efficiency condensing boilers to conserve energy.
The EPA WED's Newport Laboratory building was constructed in the 1994.  The original HVAC heating design utilized heat pumps and was replaced in 2005 with three hydronic natural gas fired boiler units that service the 38,000 sf main building.  These units are RBI model DB1500's each and are control automated.  The existing units reside in a small detached concrete block structure.  Because of the size of the existing horizontal units, it is not possible to remove a unit through the 48" door without first removing the center unit that blocks the door.  The current exhaust stack and piping will need to be isolated so that the remaining unit will continue to provide service.  Contractor shall ensure that the remaining boiler in the Newport facility provides heating and shall also provide a temporary boiler for heating until the new units are fully functional and can provide heating.  
B.  SCOPE - Boiler replacement and installations at US EPA's Western Ecology Division (WED) requires installation at two locations and in three separate buildings.  This project is to supply two (2) 1,000mbtu high efficiency condensing boilers for the Plant Ecology Building.  This project is also to install and commission a total of six (6) boilers: 1) - Two (2) Lochinvar Crest FBN 2000 Government Furnish Equipment (GFE), 2) - Two (2) Lochinvar Crest FBN 1500 boilers Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and 3) - Two (2) 1,000mbtu high efficient condensing boilers that shall be purchased and supplied by the contractor.  This project also includes the removal and disposal of: one existing boiler at the EPA WED's Plant Ecology Building; two boilers at the EPA WED's Corvallis Laboratory facility; and two boilers at the EPA WED's Newport Laboratory facility.  Lastly, the project requires commissioning and testing of all six boilers as required by Oregon State Code.  See Attachmen t # 3, Statement of Work, for the full scope of work for this requirement, Government and contractor responsibilities, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and the projected period of performance.  See Attachment # 4 for facilities & boiler sheets and floor plans.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.  <br>    <br>  PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark .  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND:  <br>  The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.  <br>    <br>  INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:  <br>  1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.  <br>       a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.  <br>       b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.  <br>       c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.  <br>       d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).  <br>       e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.  <br>       f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.  <br>       g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.  <br>       h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.  <br>    <br>  2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.  <br>    <br>  3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.  <br>    <br>  4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.  <br>    <br>  5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system.  <br>    <br>  HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:  <br>  Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking qualified contractors with Construction and Design Build experience. This procurement will result in multiple awards for IDIQ Construction Services with Design/Build Capabilities for DHS programs and other customers of the General Services Administration in the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska.&nbsp;<strong>It has been determined that competition is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located within the geographical area of Region 10 (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska), and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business within the geographical competitive area of Region 10 (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska), and the assigned NAICS code. All other 8(a) BD Participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers</strong>. <strong>Joint Venture Agreements</strong>:&nbsp; Joint Venture Agreements are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides and must be received by SBA prior to proposal due date to ensure compliance with established regulations and approved before award of a resulting contract. If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) <strong>promptly</strong>. Any corrections and/or changes needed can be made only when your BOS has adequate time for a thorough review before the proposal due date. <strong>NO CORRECTIONS AND/OR CHANGES ARE ALLOWED AFTER TIME OF SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL</strong>.&#12288;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The multiple award IDIQ contracts shall be for a period of one (1) year, with provision to exercise options for four (4) additional one year periods, not to exceed a total of five years. Multiple awards will be made with each awardee being guaranteed a minimum of $1000 for the base year only. The minimum ordering limitation per task order will be $500. The maximum ordering limitation of each contract is up to $10 million per year.&#12288;</p>

The design and construction must address any complex operational issues, be efficient to build and maintain, meet Federal Energy goals, comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and meet Federal Security requirements.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using source selection procedures.

The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)); therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.&#12288;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the Offeror. The Government may also consider the Offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the Offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FebBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for a supply IDIQ requirement entitled:  quote mark  Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags quote mark . less than br / greater than  less than br / greater than SYNOPSIS: The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to purchase passive integrated transponder (PIT) (134 - 136 kHz) tags for the next three years for research purposes associated with the Northwestern Division's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP). A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing. The PIT tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic device measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter for the large smolts and 8.5-9.0 mm long by 2.0-2.1 mm in diameter for the small smolts. The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes. As the tagged fish out-migration occurs, it passes though electronic interrogation coils established at seven permanent juvenile detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and other rivers, streams, adult ladders, etc.  Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and uniquely coded passive integrated transponder tag designed for all detection devices on the Columbia River Basin. Each tag must satisfy the Corps's requirements (without requiring major purchases of new receiver equipment (134-136 kHz range), new design of the Corner Collector technology, or compromised reliability). National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a series of tests to evaluate how well new tag models would perform in the current network of interrogation systems. The type of test performed on the PIT tags are physical and electrical parameters (measurements, weight, resonant frequency, turn-on voltage), read ranges under different noise levels, maximum read speed under different noise levels, and impact of tag grouping on reading efficiencies (how close different groups of tags could be to each other without interfering with the transceiver's ability to detect the individual tags). Performance test are held in a controlled laboratory environment as well as under field conditions. PIT tags must have been tested by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and approved by the PIT Tag Steering Committee which consists of members of various regional fisheries organizations.  PIT tags cannot interfere with other manufacture products that are already in use. There can be no measureable effect on other manufacturer's products already used in the Columbia River Basin.  The supplier must be able to produce and provide large quantities of PIT tags in a short time frame in order to meet delivery dates driven by the timing of out-migrating juvenile salmonids and research activities. Other Information: The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) when released. Solicitation is scheduled to be issued as an IDIQ contract. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. Conducting Business with the Government: In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM). All Offerors must be SAM registered prior to receiving an award. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov. By submission of a quote, a vendor acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation. No CD's or hard copies will be available. The Government is not responsible for any loss of interest, connectivity, or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted at the referenced website. Please indicate your interest by submitting a detailed statement of your firm's capabilities to supply the required items in a timely manner.

<DESC>USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source <br> award to Decision Partners, LLC., 313 E Carson St, Pittsburgh, PA 15219-1202 to facilitate meeting on technology <br> transfer, technical competence, and knowledge management in Environmental Laboratory. Decision Partners <br> recently completed a study designed to identify how to improve performance in technology transfer and adoption, <br> technical competence and knowledge management at ERDC by conducting formal behavioral decision research <br> using the mental modeling approach. The results of this research will be used to produce concrete <br> recommendations for improving technology performance across USCAE. Decision Partners LLC has significant <br> experience in helping USACE and ERDC in similar workshops; they have facilitated at least 6 meetings for ERDC <br> over the last 3 years. Decision Partners is the only commercial company offering Mental Modeling-based <br> facilitation according to our knowledge. The unique knowledge on USACE and ERDC acquired by Decision <br> Partners through this project and previous engagements with ERDC is crucial for the success of this meeting <br> since the theme of the meeting and discussions will build on the previous work conducted by Decision Partners. <br> Therefore Decision Partners LLC, is the only company that can provide the required services. <br> The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), Only One <br> Source. This will be a commercial acquisition using procedures per FAR 12. This is not a request for competitive <br> proposals and no solicitation is available.
