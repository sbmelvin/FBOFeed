<DESC><p>RECOVERY--PROJECT NUMBER AFCE092878, Anaerobic Bioreactor</p>
<p>The solicitation is being issued under AFCEEBAA-08-001, which can be found at https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=35ca5552a0265591c810430a00b4bdcb&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1 . Offerors must comply with the requirements of the BAA unless they are expressly superseded by this revision.</p>
<p>Because of its unique nature as a RECOVERY ACT requirement, responses are requested for this topic, under the above referenced BAA, on 4:00 PM CST, January 29, 2010.</p>
<p>The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is seeking white papers for an Anaerobic Bioreactor, described below, which is an additional area of interest in alternative energy under their current BAA, that will be awarded as a result of funding under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (hereafter referred to as the Recovery Act).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />Seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a feedstock of municipal solid waste from an Air Force installation to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited to landfills. The project goal will be to implement a scaled demonstration of a process flow that will: 1) process an influent of municipal solid waste that includes glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic solids as well as organic constituents; 2) optimize aerobic and anaerobic biological processes of the organic component to produce recoverable energy; 3) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 4) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills; and 5) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost). A crucial element of the project approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock of municipal solid waste from an Air Force installation comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment. The project will also include a comprehensive business case analysis that addresses critical operational factors, to include scalability and cost factors. The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase.</p>
<p>Phase I offerors submit complete a short questionnaire on the following AFCEE BAA internet site: http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 29 JAN 2010. Phase I submittals received after 29 JAN 2010, may or may not be evaluated. To be eligible for award, submission of Phase I is required.</p>
<p>The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB). Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other. Offerors whose proposals are not selected for Phase II are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link. The submittal shall concisely describe the technology and shall be evaluated according to the criteria stated in this announcement. Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information: <br /><br />(a) Technology or methodology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration/field testing. The technology or methodology must be described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application. <br />(b) The benefits to the USAF of using the proposed technology or methodology. This should include a comparison with existing technologies or methodologies, and how the proposed technology or methodology is an improvement over existing technologies or methodologies and/or lowers cost. <br />(c) The tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration/field testing, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for the demonstration/field test. <br />(d) The qualifications of the offeror to successfully perform the technology or methodology demonstration/field test. <br />(e) The economic benefit to the United States (e.g. U.S. jobs created or saved; U.S.-sourced manufacturing of materials, supplies, and components; energy independence; or other aspects of the proposed work resulting in economic benefit in the U.S.).<br /><br />Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Phase II proposals shall be submitted as attachments to an electronic submittal form that is accessed via the notification from AFCEE. The technical proposal shall be limited to 12 pages, typed at 10 pitch or larger type, single spaced, and single sided, on sheets 8.5" X 11" with 1" margins. This page limitation is inclusive of indexes, photographs, fold-outs, appendices, and attachments. Pages in excess of this limitation will not be evaluated by Government evaluators. Suggested inclusions within the 12 page limitation are: (1) four pages describing the proposed technology or methodology (2) two - three pages to be used as the Statement of Work in any resulting contract. (3) one page containing the economic benefits in the US; as well as the benefits to the Air Force. (4) one page discussing the capability of the offeror, references and point of contact for the demonstration/field test, (5) two pages describing proposed schedule for demonstration/field test, past experience and performance, and other places the technology or methodology has been demonstrated, and (6) one page list of key personnel that will perform the demonstration/field test. <br />The cost proposal has no page limitations; however, offerors are reminded to refer to FAR 15.408 Table 15.2 for guidance. The cost and technical proposals are to be submitted together in Microsoft Word and Excel formats.</p>
<p>No additional data may be submitted for this BAA. If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded. Vendor submittals that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program. Once accepted into the program, the proposal will be shared with appropriate DOD personnel for consideration. The Air Force anticipates awarding two or more contracts. However, the Air Force reserves the right to make multiple awards or no awards. To the maximum extent practicable, any contract(s) awarded using Recovery funds will be awarded as fixed price contracts. However, the Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the effort proposed under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Final selection for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's Phase II full proposal (both technical and cost) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>(1) The technical aspect, which is ranked as first in importance, shall be evaluated based on the following criteria which are of equal importance. <br />&bull; New solutions with unique applications to Air Force problems. <br />&bull; Organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposed SOW. <br />&bull; Technical approach and ability to perform. <br />&bull; The offeror shall demonstrate a clear understanding of how the proposed technology will improve upon current commercially available technologies. <br />&bull; Availability of qualified technical personnel and their experience with the applicable technology. <br />&bull; Past experience with the applicable technology. <br />&bull; Demonstration of economic benefit in the United States (for example: U.S. jobs created or saved; U.S.-sourced manufacturing of materials, supplies, and components; energy independence; or other aspects of the proposed work resulting in economic benefit in the U.S.).<br />&bull; Benefit to the US Air Force</p>
<p>(2) Cost is ranked as second in importance.</p>
<p>No other evaluation criteria will be used. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time</p>
<p>NOTICE ON ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: Federal agencies are required to include terms and conditions in contract documents necessary to ensure the transparency and accountability objectives of the Recovery Act are met. Section 1512(c) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) requires, as a condition of receipt of funds, quarterly reporting by the prime contractor on the use of funds. FAR Case 2009-0009 is preparing an Interim Rule to be issued in mid-March (effective immediately) to require contractors to report information including, but not limited to the following items:</p>
<p>1.) Government contract / order number<br />2.) The dollar amount of contractor invoices for work funded by recovery act funds<br />3.) A detailed list of all services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor has invoiced, including: <br />a. Program or project title <br />b. A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract <br />c. An assessment of the progress towards completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract <br />d.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Ashley Johnson for Willie Forrest

<a href="mailto:Ashley.Johnson6@va.gov">Contracting Specialist</a>
<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCEThis notice is for informational purposes only.  The VA intends to Sole Source for the procurement Integrated Operating Room Equipment with Alliant using Statutory Authority  38 U.S.C. 8127(d) (PL 109-461) at the Edwards Hines Jr. VA Hospital Hines, IL.  See below Justification and Approval for additional information. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  532952.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition to furnish and install Stryker- Integrated Operating Room(s), to include Endoscopic Video, Video Integration, Booms and Lights, in connection with ongoing renovation construction project of six (6) New Operating Rooms, located on the second (2ND) floor of building #200, at the Edward Hines Jr., VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois. 3.	A description of supplies/services required:  The Stryker boom-mounted surgical systems (lights, monitors, etc.) for 6 operating rooms, is the only product that can interface with the existing Stryker equipment already being installed in the first 3 operating rooms in the ongoing surgery project at Hines.  The equipment is meant to communicate between operating rooms and with the surgical office, so it is critical that all devices can be networked together.  The equipment had to be purchased in phases, to coincide with various phases of the construction, and also to fit within budgetary constraints.    The contractor is registered in CCR and VetBiz.4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  The VA's statutory authority to make sole-source awards to VOSBs is set forth at 38 U.S.C. sect. 8127, Pub. L. No. 109-461, 120 Stat. 3431, 3432 (2006). This authority allows the VA to award to an VOSB on a sole-source basis when:(1) such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;(2) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and(3) in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:   As a definite part of the Hines VAMC mission, needs to be able to do the following: proceed with the surgery construction without delay, so that the area can be occupied for clinical use as soon as possible, and without any financial penalties.  The VA also needs to be able to communicate information on patient status, case status, medical data, etc. between surgical suites and personnel to best meet patient needs and keep critical procedures on track without delays.  If the Hines VAMC would not obtain this particular product, it would not be able to complete the existing construction project on time and would introduce significant additional costs and delays to redesign the remaining operating room.  Also, installing another vendor's system would require significant amount of time training staff, but would introduce confusion should staff have to go from OR to another with entirely different type of equipment in use. 6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  N/A.7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  This requirement will proceed as a commercial acquisition, negotiated sole source, with Alliant Healthcare Products of Richland, MI.  Pricing shall be analyzed based on the contractor's commercial practices.  The Contracting Officer anticipates awarding the contract costs to be consistent with the past procurement for the same equipment under contractVA69D-P-1018 which was purchased in June 2009.  The Independent Government Cost Estimate is $1,330,363.71 and the Government anticipates the award amount to be $1,305,363.71.  The Contracting Officer anticipates the negotiated price to be fair and reasonable. 8.	Market survey conducted:  A Vet-Biz & CCR search was completed.9.	Other facts:  None10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.WILLIE FORRESTContracting Officer

Interested and capable sources should contact by e-mail the Program Manager, Steve Littleton at steve.littleton@tinker.af.mil  or the Contracting Officer, Amy Hawkins at amy.hawkins@tinker.af.mil, fax: 405.739.5451, by no later than 22 January 2010.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.  Below is a general description of the services required.
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the New Mexico BLM has been tasked with ensuring positional mapping accuracy of records and boundaries in support of renewable energy development. The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey information and GPS positions to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System in support of parcel based recordation, as well as analysis and display of geographic information.  This information known as the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), has been assembled in a series of ascii flat files which is converted to a GIS format to support stakeholders and customers of the information. 
The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships, is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  
This work will include the research of survey information for each corner in preparation for recovering survey corners and measuring their positions with survey grade GPS receivers.  Research may be conducted on federal, state, or private/local government survey records.   Work shall include research that is needed to efficiently locate, record information, and measure the location of survey corners or boundary locations.  Only one coordinate pair in North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83), is needed for all rectangular or non-rectangular corners.  The accepted GPS measurements will be used for control in the GCDB.   Digital photographs of found monumentation as well as other evidence such as bearing trees etc. shall be collected.  This work shall be performed for 1095 corner positions.    
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.

A determination has been made that a Labor Hour task order is appropriate for this acquisition and that no other contract type is suitable. The elements of consideration, prescribed by FAR 12.207 to be used as guidelines to assess whether or not a labor hour contract is appropriate for this acquisition and that no other contract type is suitable, and the facts related to this acquisition are as follows:
a. Market research has revealed this service is s commercial service. There are several potential sources available under GSA Schedule 899 Environmental Services Firms.  
b. In this particular situation, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence because work load is dependent upon biological factors which affect spawning such as water temperature, and the number of positive findings. Additionally, work requirements will be susceptible to weather conditions and reservoir accessibility, neither of which, the government nor the contractor can reasonably anticipate in advance.
c. In order to maximize the use of firm fixed price this delivery order will utilize pre-priced firm fixed price hourly labor rates and will include a ceiling price based on the best estimate of the number of hours that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. The contractor shall be required to notify the government immediately when the total amount invoiced is expected to exceed 75% of the total amount of the order. Estimated travel-related costs and any other direct costs not covered in the labor hour rates will be reimbursed based on allowable costs in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations.
d. There will be adequate Government surveillance of contractor performance conducted by Reclamation's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).   The COR will monitor the contract employee's training performance, productivity, and ability to produce a high quality of performance on a monthly basis.  Results of these activities will be recorded and reported to the CO.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 5 START CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-S5-06-04. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT. The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #16 is to obligate $125,000.00 for a Targeted Brownfield Assessment (TBA) of the Multiple Cleveland Landbank Properties, City of Cleveland, County of Cuyahoga, State of Ohio. The period of performance will be from December 30, 2009 through September 30, 2010. Requirements for TO #16 include the following: 1) attending meeting(s) and conference calls with State, EPA Project Manager, and City; 2) preparing a site-specific QA Project Plan (QAPP) and Health &amp; Safety Plan (HASP); 3) preparing a site-specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP); 4) conducting Phase II field/investigation work; 5) preparing the Phase II Assessment Report; 6) preparing the draft and final cleanup plan with cost estimates; 7) preparing the Property Profile Form (PPF) or entering into EPA ACRES; 8) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA" or "the Act") contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.

<SOLNBR>OS25327
<CONTACT>Paula L Conner, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-1198, Email paula.conner@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Government intends to solicitate and award a task order contract to provide support to the Office of the National Coordinator ONC - State Health Information Exchange Technical Assistance Program.  The purpose of this project is to provide technical assistance, within the five domains of health information exchange (HIE), as described below, to State HIE Cooperative Agreement awardees as the awardees facilitate the development of statewide HIE capacity. Providing states with effective technical assistance for planning and implementing HIE is vital to the success of the nationwide HIT agenda. The five domains are listed below.

 Governance  This domain addresses the functions of convening health care stakeholders to create trust and consensus on an approach for statewide HIE and to provide oversight and accountability of HIE to protect the public interest.

Under AE procurement/evaluation procedures, three firms were selected from the respondents and interviews were held July 30, 2009.   Due to the unavailability of local funding after the interviews, the project was put on hold until recently when it was approved for ARRA funding.

<p>5. Must not cause a 6% reduction for a period of seven continuous days in the yield of <br />insects, size of insects, or reproductive potential (oviposition rate), nor affect the life cycle <br />by an increase of 24 hours or more as determined by USDA bioassay after award of contract, <br />i.e. no bioassay of the sample is done because of the length of time required.</p>
<p>6. Agar must have a gel strength of 1500 g pressure or more as determined with FMC agar gel <br />testing machine, measurement is made as follows:</p>
<p>a. Nine grams of agar are weighed and placed in a small flask.<br />b. Six hundred fifty (650) milliliters of water is preheated to 140 degrees F in a stainless steel beaker. The beaker is then placed on a hot plate/stirrer which has been on high for 30 minutes.<br />c. The stirrer bar is activated and the agar is slowly added in and mixed.<br />d. When the mixture reaches boiling, a timer is set for five (5) minutes and the agar is kept at a rolling boil for the 5 minute period. At the end of the 5 minutes, it is removed from the heat and allowed to sit for one (1) minute. It is then poured into 50mm x 70mm crystallizing dishes. The first dish is partially filled in' order to remove as much foam from the cooked agar as possible. Three (3) additional dishes are then filled as full as possible.<br />e. Samples are allowed to gel three (3) *hours at room temperature.<br />f. A full dish of agar is set in the center of the platform of the electronic scale. The power is turned on and the scale tared to 0. The LED light is illuminated in order to maintain peak reading after the gel ruptures. The small plunger (10.9mm) and the blue spring (0 1500 grams tension) is used at high speed (18cm/minute). The down button is lowered which starts the synchronous motor which lowers the plunger at a constant rate. Once the plunger contacts the gel the increasing force is registered on the scale display. The highest measured force is when the gel ruptures, this reading will be maintained on the display until the LED light is turned off and the break force reading is recorded.<br />g. All three (3) dishes are tested and the average break force reading is used for the final result.</p>
<p>7. The gel point shall be within 32 degrees to 45 degrees C. and the melting point shall be <br />within 85 degrees to 89 degrees C.<br />8. Must readily dissolve in boiling water within 5 minutes.<br />9. Microbial content shall not exceed 10,000 micro-organisms per gram and must be free of <br />other contaminants.<br />9.

<DESC>Sources Sought Amendment:

There are 56 states and territories who are potential users for the Federal Voting Assistance Program wizards, and will have interfaces with the FVAP wizards as described in this request for information.  Four states have been randomly selected which represent small, medium, and large military and overseas voter populations, and varying numbers of voting jurisdictions.  

As the Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires states to establish a Voter Registration Systems database, there will most likely be some requirement for states to provide integration of jurisdictions at the state level in order to interface with the FVAP provided wizards that is the focus of this effort.  States will need to provide some integration and/or standardized interface for interoperability with the FVAP wizard programs, especially in terms of ballot data migration.  

Both Election Management System (EMS) and Voter Registration System (VRS) interfaces are subsets of the wizard requirements, and should be ROM cost subsets for the wizard ROM.  Each EMS and VRS will require its own unique interface in order to move ballot style/format information and election rules to an online system.

This request for information requires addressing known ROM costs by system elements for interfacing with the example states identified, if they are different.  Additional known interface differences/ROM costs for other states and/or territories, which may not be specifically identified in the request for information, is also requested.  In addition to ROM costs for the four states identified, if a respondent believes a standard ROM cost by election jurisdiction would be a relatively standardized cost, the respondent should submit such ROM cost estimates as well.

<CONTACT>Allison C Ford, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0101, Fax 301-443-1004, Email aford@psc.gov
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

The purpose of this project is to identify performance measures and develop and conduct both a formative and summative evaluation of the State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreements Program (section 3013) required under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009. 

The State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreements Program was created in an effort to provide resources to support states in developing or implementing plans to establish an infrastructure for statewide exchange of electronic health information.  Without the active exchange of health information, the United States will fail to achieve its overall goals of higher quality and more efficient health care for all Americans. The Office of the National Coordinator will award the grants in 2010.

This evaluation, required by HITECH, will focus primarily on the effectiveness of the state cooperative agreements in establishing information exchange capability by studying the progress of states, within their various stages, in implementing and expanding information exchange. This evaluation will supplement and support the efforts of the grantees, who will be conducting their own evaluations as part of their cooperative agreements.  Lessons learned and key findings will be shared with program managers and grantees.  The results of both the individual state evaluations and this ONC-funded annual evaluation will contribute to the overall assessment of progress towards widespread use and exchange of electronic health information.  

The contractor selected for this evaluation will be required to cooperate with an ONC-funded contractor who will be performing a global evaluation to assess the combined impact of the HITECH programs.

Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Puget Sound Health Care System, 9600 Veterans Drive, Tacoma, WA 98493. 2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for General Electric Healthcare to relocate one GE LightSpeed Pro 16 CT Scanner, from the first floor to the second floor of Building 81 at American Lake, Tacoma, WA. The move is scheduled to occur on or about January 8, 2010 and the estimated time to complete this requirement is eight days.3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Minor Project 663-341 is remodeling the Radiology Clinic in Building 81 at American Lake, Tacoma, WA.

Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: In the event of future requirements, market research will be conducted for potential contractors that are authorized to provide relocation services for the GE LightSpeed Pro 16 CT Scanner.11.
