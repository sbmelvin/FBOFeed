Experience with PIN-Diode Phase Shifter and Time Delay Assembly maintenance and repair will be noted. Reverse engineering experience of obsolete components and assemblies will also be noted. Offerors must have expertise to develop and modify Ada software programs under VMS and UNIX operating systems, using the DEC Ada and Rationale Apex programming environments on VAX 6000-series mainframes and SUN workstations. Software engineering requirements are applicable to both on-site and at the CDU S/W facility. Detailed knowledge of data collection and space surveillance radar algorithms, and data analysis to determine system performance and data processing are essential. Offerors must provide personnel to operate and maintain all interior on-site and CDU S/W facility communications systems, in addition to coordinating communications anomalies with outside agencies. Communicators must be well versed in DoD communications procedures and maintain SECRET clearances to handle COMSEC accounts.

<DESC>The Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR), 1515 College Ave., Manhattan, KS 66502, conducts innovative research and develops new technologies to solve problems related to flour production; CGAHR is in need of a new Milling Machine. One of the CGAHR requirements for a Mill is that can process bushels of wheat, so that those bushels can be continuously milled. The experimental milling system must be capable of performing the U.S. Hard Winter Wheat Crop Survey. Should be capable of producing at least six (6) flour products, this provides considerably more information how the wheat sample might perform on a large-scale commercial mill, which is a critical requirement of the crop survey. Consistency in data methods is of paramount importance.<br /><br />This procurement action is subject to the availability of funds. Funds are not currently available to procure this Grain Mill.

<DESC>TITLE:  NNA04CI14T  SECTEK,  Inc.NASA/ARC has a requirement to increase the Time and Materials (T&M) Ceiling of the T&Morders for the	ARC Protective Services Contract which will result in an increase in thetotal ceiling price of the Time and Material and Labor-Hour Contract. The contractconsists of six one-month option periods through December 31, 2010. The exercise of eachoption will be determined by the Government on a monthly basis. NASA/ARC intends to increase the Time and Materials (T&M) Ceiling of the T&M orders forcontract NNA04CI14T, for protective services. This contract was awarded as a result offull and open competition under a GSA Schedule to SECTEK Inc., on June 1, 2004. Thisincrease is necessary not only to provide for support of on-going task order requirementsthrough the expiration of the performance period ending December 31, 2010, if all optionsare exercised by the Government,  but to also bridge the performance period between theend of the current contract and resolution of the current protest challenging NASAsagency-wide contract which was awarded on May 20, 2008, for protection services (i.e.Security guard services, potential fire/fighting/prevention services, and potentialemergency medical response services).Authorization for the extension and resultant increase in the total ceiling price ofcontract NNA04CI14T was issued by NASA Headquarters under PIC-09-04A, dated December 29,2009, which provides a class deviation from the requirements of FAR 17.204(e) and NFS1817.204(e)(iii), limiting the terms of service contracts to five (5) years, includingthe basic contract and all options. This class deviation applies only to existingcontracts requirements that will ultimately be provided under the agency-wide NASAProtective Services Contract (NPSC). Unanticipated increases in requirements provided for under the T&M orders havenecessitated the T&M Ceiling and resultant total ceiling price of the contract to beincreased in support of these services.NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) to increase the T&M Ceiling of the T&M orders and resultant totalceiling price of the contract for the six one-month option periods through December 31,2010.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 26, 2010. Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST be in writing andshould be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 26, 2010. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury &amp; Prevention Control contemplates awarding a firm fixed price purchase order to a national organization that represents medical examiners and/or coroners to develop strategies for improving data collection from Medical Examiners/Coroners. This acquisition is competed in accordance with FAR Part 13 and the proposed NAICS code for this requirement is 541512.</p>
<p>Background and need:<br />The CMS is a group of related SQL tables designed to create and manage measures, drive the query screen, and generate displays for the public portal. This project will focus on enhancing the CMS and make it an easy to use, robust tool for managing the business rules and system requirements for data in the Tracking Network. Creating and managing measures within the CMS facilitates communication of requirements between Science Development Team, the Informatics Team, and the contractors. It provides a centralized location for requirements and supporting information about measures that can be easily modified and updated. Currently the CMS contains only a small number of the tables and relationships needed to capture all the information involved in creating and managing measures (only one aspect of the complete CMS). The CMS also lacks a user interface that would allow for information to be easily added and modified. Completion of the necessary tables and relationships along with the creation of a WEB-based interface would allow for more efficient and effective management of the documentation required for creating and managing measures thus reducing the possibility of improper or incorrect display of data on the public portal.</p>
<p>It is expected that work will take no more than six months to complete. The CMS will allow the user to manage business rules and requirements for the Tracking Network.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for weaving two types of cloth using 1500 denier N610(Nextel) oxide fiber.  The Vendor will provide the fiber and fabricate the required 12.5width (delivered in 3 ft. long sections) of fabric.  They will deliver high quality woven"Layer to Layer" cloth.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Textile Engineering & Manufacturing (TEAM)because they have state-of-the-art weaving equipment and experience making 2.5/3Dpreforms out of Nextel fibers.	They can design different 2.5/3D weaves, and they havethe ability to scale-up to provide significantly wider cloth that could be used to makelarge oxide/oxide CMC (ceramic matrix composite) components.  The Vendor has also devisedthese layer to layer weaves so that they will yield the required high fiber loading(overall, 35-45% fiber loading), with significant through-thickness fiber reinforcementto help increase interlaminar properties and impact resistance, which will yield thedesired thickness CMCs.  Textile Engineering & Manufacturing (TEAM) has demonstratedthese weave constructions using the Nextel 610 fiber and have proven they can achievehigh fiber loading while minimizing damage to the fibers.  This is critical to us as iteliminates the large risk associated with anyone else attempting to fabricate a 2.5/3Dperform for the first time.  We can only use weaves/performs with loading over 35 volume% and with minimal strength-degradation.  It would not be cost effective to thegovernment both in time and money to begin this process over again.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Prodedures put forth in FAR Part 13.

<DESC>NASA intends to enter into a sole-source contract extension with HoneywellTechnology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One ResponsibleSource in support of NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center, Flight Projects Directorate. The Mission Operations Mission Services (MOMS) contract, NNG04DA01C, is a Cost plus AwardFee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract.  Thisprocurement is to extend the effective ordering period of Contract NNG04DA01C, MOMS, fora period of one year beginning November 1, 2010 through October 31, 2011.  This contractextension is to allow for completion of the MOMS competitive follow-on procurement,Ground Systems and Mission Operations (GSMO), and post award activities, including the 60day phase-in/phase-out. The anticipated award date for GSMO is April 2011.  The one yearextension may not be required in total, and task orders will be issued strategically inincremental periods to meet the mission/customer requirements until the competitivefollow-on is awarded and phase-in/phase-out is completed.There is no increase to the estimated value of the MOMS Contract for the continuation ofservices, the modification of existing services, and for new work. The current contractvalue can accommodate the estimated costs for the one year ordering period extension. The contract extension is required to ensure critical mission support and continuity toavoid significant technical programmatic impacts to NASA projects.  The scope of theexisting work includes the following functional requirements: Technical Management,Business Management, Quality Assurance Management, Safety and Health Management, PropertyAdministration Management, Documentation, Electronics Security, Flight Operations,Observatory Engineering, Spacecraft Analysis, Ground System Analysis, Hubble SpaceTelescope (HST) Computer Operations Support, Level Zero and Mission Data ProcessingEarth Observing System (EOS) Data and Operations System (EDOS), Sustaining EngineeringSoftware and Hardware Maintenance, System and Database Administration, SystemsEngineering Reviews for Mission Operations, System Engineering External InterfaceManagement, Risk Management, Network Engineering, System Engineering and Development,Engineering Studies, Integration and Test, Information Technology Expertise Support,Communications System Maintenance, Mission Critical Maintenance Support, Mission VoiceSystems Maintenance, Network Analysis, Video and Data Services, Goddard TV CentralFacility Operations, Nascom Security Control Center Operations, Programmatic SecurityOperations and Configuration Management, Technical Control and Data Switching ServiceOperations, Technical Control and Data Switching Service Technical Management, TechnicalControl and Data Switching Service Mission Critical Operations, Conversion Device ServiceOperations, Conversion Device Service Mission Critical Operations, Mission OperationsIntegration and Planning, Nascom Network Scheduling, Transponder Management andOperations, Solar Interference Predicts, Nascom Freeze Exemption Requests, OperationalAreas Facilities Work, and Network Operations Mission Critical Operations.   The space science missions in operations currently under this contract are AdvancedComposition Explorer (ACE), Cluster-II, Geotail, Kepler, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter(LRO), Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric ParticleExplorer (SAMPEX), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and Wind.  The earth sciencemissions in operations currently supported by this contract are AQUA, AURA, Terra,Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Earth Observing One (EO-1), and Advanced LandObserving Satellite (ALOS).  Missions currently supported by the contract duringdevelopment include Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), James Webb Space Telescope(JWST), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), Magnetospheric Multi-scale Mission (MMS),and the National Polar-orbit Operational Environment Satellite System (NPOESS)Preparatory Project (NPP).  Many other missions are supported during the conceptdevelopment and mission proposal phase.HTSI as the current and in-place incumbent has the in-depth knowledge of the missions inoperations, government facilities, management structure and personnel to provideuninterrupted continuation of mission critical operations support. An interruption andrestart of the services currently being performed with a new contractor that isunfamiliar with the existing missions, facilities, and the specific requirements of theMOMS contract would jeopardize the success of NASA space exploration goals achieved bythe day to day operation of critical ground and space systems assets.  Due to the timeand substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in anothercontractor at this time, HTSI is considered the only contractor that can meet NASAs GSFCneeds given the anticipated short period of this extension.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Leica Microsystems of Bannockburn, IL, for the purchase of an SP5II White Light Spectral Confocal Imaging System.
<p>***Sole Source determination is based on the following: Leica Microsystems is the only vendor that offers a microscope that meets our technical requirements listed above. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NIST requirements for: (1)Long term stability of the stable excitation color selection (from 470 nm to 670 nm) and high throughput precision wavelength window control, the system needs to activate up to 8 excitation wavelengths simultaneously, to tune these 8 wavelengths in 1 nm increments and to suppress the transmission of the laser line within 2 or 3 nanometers; (2) High sensitivity imaging of up to eight different types of molecules, a tunable device needs to deflect up to 8 laser lines simultaneously into the excitation beam path, and allows 95% of all emitted wavelengths to pass to the spectral detectors; (3)For fast dynamic molecular imaging, the scanning system must be a true Point Scanning system with scanning speed of up to 2,800 Hz (or up to 250 frames per second) and with an option to add a capability to increase the scanning speed up to 16,000 Hz (1400 frames per second). As a result, Leica Microsystems is uniquely qualified to provide the required Confocal Imaging station. Leica is the only vendor that manufactures and distributes a system that meets NIST technical requirements. This technology is proprietary to Leica.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with AB Sciex LLC of Foster City, California for the purchase of a Maintenance Service Agreement for 5 AB Sciex LC/MS Instruments under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

This support plan shall provide:
	1.	Preventative maintenance;
	2.	Guaranteed priority response by factory certified engineers;
	3.	Copyrighted advanced service diagnostic;
	4.	Labor and travel fees;
	5.	Covered replacement parts;
	6.	Formal escalation procedure/process;
	7.	Priority technical assistance center support;
	8.	Priority application technical phone support;
	9.	Smart monitoring.

The overall complexity of the system (consisting of computer-controlled ion mass separation and detection electronics, computer data acquisition and control elements, extremely sensitive electrospray ionization chambers, ion traps, ion collision and fragmentation chambers, and autosamplers) necessitates an extremely detailed and intricate knowledge of the system, its components, and the software that controls them to maintain the system (Except for the liquid chromatographs, the control computer, the video monitor, and the printers, all the components of the system are custom-designed and manufactured by AB Sciex).  Maintaining such a system requires not only special knowledge, but also special test programs, test equipment, software, and tools.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Menlo Systems, Inc. of Newton, New Jersey for the purchase of a MHz Erbium-Fiber Frequency Comb Synthesizer under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

NISTs Nanoscale and Optical Metrology Group has a requirement for an frequency comb (OFC, which is a pulsed laser with extraordinarily high frequency stability and a wavelength coverage spanning the visible and near-ir.  A laser of this type is required for ultra-high-resolution absorption spectroscopy experiments of greenhouse gases. 
  
Key required specifications are as follows:

1.	The optical-frequency comb system shall have an optical frequency accuracy of one part in one hundred trillion (1:1014), or better, during 1 second.

2.	The optical-frequency comb system shall have a stability (Allan deviation) of five parts in ten trillion (5:1013), or better, during 1 second.
    
3.	The system shall provide comb lines spanning a spectral range from 530 nanometers to 2100 nanometer; lines shall be separate by 250 MHz.

4.	The output beam shape shall be TEM00, with beam quality factor M2 < 1.2, or better.

5.	The carrier-envelope- frequency of the optical-frequency comb shall be actively stabilized using the self-referencing f to 2f beat note method in combination with an octave-spanning supercontinuum, and referenced to a radio-frequency source.

6.	System shall be capable of measuring the beat-signal between the optical-frequency comb and an external continuous-wave laser, over the spectral range of 1200 nanometers to 1600 nanometers.

7.	Fully automated, turn-key, and continuous operation.

8.	All components, systems, and subsystems included.

The MHz Erbium-Fiber Frequency Comb Synthesizer offered by Menlo Systems, Inc. is the only commercially available integrated system that meets all of NISTs specific research needs, yielding an OFC system with self-referencing, 250 MHz repetition rate, tunable carrier envelope offset frequency, 0.5 um to 2 um wavelength range and relative frequency stability of 5x10-13 in 1 second averaging time.  Menlo Systems is the only company that sells a complete OFC system spanning the visible and near-ir spectral region. 

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

BRAND NAME SPECIFIED IS MANDATORY
Parts or components described herein by reference to a manufacturer's name and/or part number and nomenclature shall be furnished in strict accordance with the manufacturer's published data relating to said supplies except to the extent otherwise specified in this contract.
Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements, under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304 (C)(1).  Due to the unique knowledge and support equipment required, the OEM (Sea Tel Inc,) can support and service the existing SEATEL 4996T TX/RX Ku-Band Antennas.  
SOLE SOURCE:  These antennas are part of the Ship Board Data Collection System that supports the Combat System ships Qualification trials (CSSQT) and Navy/FMS test and Evaluation events.  To ensure proper support and equipment operation it is required that as routine maintenance the replacement parts be purchased.  
Due to the existing antenna systems in operation, complete interchangeability of parts with original equipment is mandatory.  There is insufficient time to obtain and analyze data to insure interchangeability of parts if other than the brand name parts specified are furnished; therefore, bids/proposals offering parts of other than the supplier referenced will be rejected. The offeror warrants that the parts to be delivered hereunder will be of the part number(s) and the supplier specified.
This will be a commercial acquisition using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) codes 339999.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by August 02, 2010 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  A proposal may be submitted via e-mail or facsimile with complete mailing address, point of contact, phone number, facsimile number, business size and shall be clearly marked with solicitation N00244-10-T-0323.  Please forward your information not later than 4:00 PM PST July 30 2010 to Rachel.McFarland@navy.mil or by facsimile (562) 626-7877.

<SUBJECT>66--Medium Duty Four Wheel Drive Dynamometer for EPA-NVFEL
<SOLNBR>PR-CI-10-10732
<ARCHDATE>07212010
<CONTACT>SAMANTHA FUCHS, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2347, E-Mail: fuchs.samantha@epa.gov

<a href="mailto:fuchs.samantha@epa.gov">SAMANTHA FUCHS</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to procure up to four 4-Wheel Drive Medium Duty Dynamometers.   This acquisition will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.
EPA is undertaking a comprehensive program to enhance its capability to conduct low level emissions testing of the highest precision and accuracy at its NVFEL facility in  Ann Arbor.  As a result of the Renewable Fuel Standards program, increased emphasis will be placed on testing vehicles operated on renewable fuels.  Other enhancements will enable performance of both cold-temperature and air conditioning testing.
The full Statement of Work (SOW), which will be included in the solicitation, describes the engineering and operational requirements for chassis dynamometers that will be required for implementing these enhanced capabilities.  The equipment implementation described in the full SOW is comprised of a four-wheel dynamometer for a new Cold Test Facility being built at NVFEL, an option for purchase of a second system for use in a test site planned for high-temperature (SCO3) testing, and an option to procure up to two additional dynamometers to replace existing equipment.  The agency intends to issue an award for first 4WD dynamometer and exercise options for up to three additional dynamometers within 18 months after the date of contract award.
Federal regulations for exhaust emissions and fuel economy of motor vehicles specify tests using chassis dynamometers.  The purpose of the chassis dynamometer is to duplicate the forces encountered by a vehicle moving on a road by modeling those characteristics with a stationary vehicle on a rotating surface.  The dynamometer specified in the full SOW will provide EPA with additional testing capabilities to support both current and future regulations as well as a range of evaluation and development activities.  This dynamometer will be used to test a wide range of vehicles including front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, four wheel drive and all wheel drive with the full range of powertrain technology including those providing energy conservation through regenerative braking.  These vehicles will include those powered by some combination of internal combustion engines, electric motors and storage devices, hydraulics and hydraulic storage systems, and fuel cells.
The dynamometers shall incorporate the following general features for testing these vehicles:
Accurate and precise road load determination and simulation, utilizing the latest technology, through a digitally-controlled, electrically-activated, motor-absorber that recreates the mechanical inertia and frictional forces that would be present on the road with electrically generated load forces based on specific equations, coefficients and response characteristics.
Vehicle loading applied to the tires by 48" diameter rolls connected to intermediate motor/absorbers on a per axle configuration that contacts each vehicle tire.
Capability of testing all light duty vehicles, medium-duty passenger vehicles and  complete heavy duty vehicles up to 14,000 GVW on a Federal Test Register US06 Driving Trace which has a maximum acceleration rate of 8.0 MPH/second, in two wheel drive and four wheel drive configurations.  Vehicle testing shall be accomplished by simulating all load conditions that the vehicle can experience on a dry smooth road.  Hence, the roll sets shall operate with synchronous speeds in order to simulate conditions that would reasonably occur on the road.
The chassis dynamometer shall conform to the requirements specified in the full SOW.  For the equipment specified, the Contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff.  The Contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.
Award will be made on a ?Best Value? basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important that price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed dynamometer to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant corporate experience.  The solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps website on or about June 16, 2010.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Samantha Fuchs, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487 2347, or  e mail at fuchs.samantha@epa.gov.   Questions must be submitted in writing to Samantha via fax  or e-mail.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Honduras (USAID/Honduras), Office of Democracy and Governance (DG), requests the services of a contractor to undertake a new five year-program, the goal of which is to strengthen Honduran democracy in approximately thirty-five municipalities by increasing citizen satisfaction with and participation in creating a more transparent, accountable government. This will be achieved through supporting decentralized, democratic government-provided or -regulated services to improve service delivery; increase local government capacity to oversee decentralized services and respond to citizen feedback; provide mechanisms through which civil society can engage with local governments and service providers to express their concerns; and improve the capacity of the national government and institutions to implement laws and regulations to further enhance decentralization. The program will operate at the local level, thereby benefitting primarily rural poor populations, and increasing the participation of politically and/or economically excluded citizens in democratic processes to bring about a direct improvement in their lives.
<p>The contractor will design and implement a program that strengthens democracy in Honduras by increasing citizen satisfaction with and participation in decentralized, democratic government through improved service delivery in the health sector to gradually lead to improved priority services identified by the target communities. It is expected that these actions will result in more transparent, accountable government. To achieve these ends, the contractor will undertake activities in four core component areas: 1) Civil society advocacy for improved local services increased; 2) Local institutional capacity to deliver decentralized services strengthened 3)Structures and systems to implement reform strengthened; and 4) Small Grants mechanism to administer, fund, and evaluate activities with partner organizations.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earthquake Hazards Center, intends to award of a non-competitive purchase order to Shannon and Wilson of Seattle, Washington to provide field oversight of the drilling and well construction at nine boreholes at the Stanford Educational Center in Seattle, Washington.  The nine boreholes will be instrumented to provide a state-of-the art liquefaction-monitoring array in the Duwamish Valley in Seattle.  The USGS is working with the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) on the Stanford installation.  The borehole drilling at the Stanford Educational Center must be accomplished within a very narrow time window set by the site owner, Seattle Public Schools.  The Stanford Center is a major facility for Seattle Public Schools and houses much of the district's maintenance and operations capability.  These functions require constant access to a large equipment storage yard that is accessed by an array of vehicles passing through the site of the liquefaction-monitoring array.  These considerations limit access to the instrument site to two months over the summer, when district usage of the Stanford Center is lowest.  Thus, all drilling, logging, and well construction must be completed during this time.
Shannon and Wilson oversaw a series of deep boreholes drilled for the proposed Seattle Monorail on the property owned by Seattle Schools at the Stanford Center.  One of those holes was in the middle of the array of nine holes the USGS plans to drill.  The maximum depth of the monorail test hole was deeper than any proposed by the USGS, thus the previous drilling provides very detailed sampling of the geology expected at depth.   The monorail drilling required nearly the same level of detailed geotechnical oversight as required by the USGS for this liquefaction array.  The Stanford site has very complex sedimentary geology in the upper few hundred feet of the section.  There is relatively little obvious variation in many of the layers comprising this upper section, and identifying cuttings from the boreholes is extremely tricky.  However, because all USGS holes will be within 50' of the Seattle Monorail boring, we can take full advantage of Shannon and Wilson's detailed understanding and knowledge of the site geology. Indeed, our likely sample depths will be very close to those done by Shannon and Wilson for Seattle Monorail.  Because we are meeting sample standards essentially identical to those done for the monorail exploration, the field geologist/engineer will be able to easily compare previous experience at laboratory reports at the site with cuttings as they exit the USGS boreholes. 
In addition to the test borehole for Seattle Monorail at the site of the nine USGS boreholes, Shannon and Wilson oversaw the drilling of another six boreholes for Seattle Monorail either on the Stanford Center property or within a few blocks.  Thus, this firm has acquired a unmatched understanding of both the local expected site geology and variations as the USGS hole locations move away from those closest to the Seattle Monorail hole.  The Seattle Monorail is the only project in the area that has had such a wide sampling of the sedimentary geology to the depths required by the USGS, and thus, Shannon and Wilson's experience is unique. 
This particular site knowledge of Shannon and Wilson allows several advantages to the USGS.  First, most of the samples are expected to be heavily watered, and care must be taken to properly handle these samples to ensure proper geotechnical analysis in the lab. (Stanford Center was chosen for this monitoring precisely because of its proximity to known water-saturated sedimentary layers that have liquefied in previous earthquakes).  Shannon and Wilson has handled these samples on the previous test borehole and has demonstrated their ability to use the sample test results to develop a borehole log.   Second, the ability to rapidly determine geologic units as the drilling proceeds on each borehole translates into minimizing drilling time on the USGS boreholes.  Because Shannon and Wilson has already done this identification at this site they are uniquely qualified to oversee the drilling and examine the cuttings as they exit the hole.  Third, Shannon and Wilson, having worked through the entire section for Seattle Monorail, will be able to quickly notify the drilling contractor that the final desired hole depth has been reached for each borehole (the hole depths listed above are approximate-the final depths are dependent on verification by the field geologist/engineer that the target geology has been reached). 
The Government intends to award this requirement in accordance with the procedures of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR Part 12, entitled, "Acquisition of Commercial Items."

<DESC>In general, the work consists of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform Operation and Maintenance Services for DOD Army Medical Facilities nationwide, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Anticipated work contains full-service, continuous-coverage operation and maintenance (O&M) of medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.  In addition, task orders may be awarded for construction requirements incidental to O&M (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).  There are a wide variety of buildings and finishes (and a variety of building ages and conditions) that will be covered on any given O&M Task Order.  Buildings vary from World War II lapped siding to new pre-engineered metal buildings to towering steel-frame pre-cast concrete skinned multi-story buildings.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to emergency generators; electrical switchgear; electrical distribution; lighting; plumbing systems; roof and storm drain systems; heating ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC] heating boilers; HVAC water chillers; HVAC cooling towers; HVAC pumps; variable frequency motor controllers; HVAC air handling units; operating room and isolation room pressurization systems; digital HVAC controls; nurse call; patient monitoring systems; intrusion detection systems; infant abduction systems; fire detection/alarm systems; fire sprinkler systems; carbon dioxide, wet and dry chemical fire suppression systems; elevators; pneumatic tube and box conveyor transport systems; medical gas systems to include medical air compressors, medical vacuum pumps, bulk oxygen tank farms, and medical gas and vacuum distribution and alarm panels; laboratory fume hoods; interior finishes; signage systems; structural building components such as roofs and building exterior faade; and passive fire protection systems (including fire and smoke partition integrity maintenance).  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding O&M tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility  many with a critically ill inpatient population.  Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but Contractors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from badging to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.<BR>The Government contemplates awards of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year and four one-year options.  Firm Fixed-Price Task Orders will be issued against the contracts. The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is $250,000,000.00. There is no guarantee that this maximum value will be distributed equally. Awardees will share this total value through a competitive task order award process. The requirement is handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, Mobile, AL. Solicitation documents should be available for download on or around 23 February 2010.  Contracting Officer for this project is Ms. Donna Parker.  <BR>Questions specific to this solicitation may be answered by sending an email to jacalyn.m.jenkins@usace.army.mil and cynthia.y.dunham@usace.army.mil or facsimile: 251-690-2675.

<DESC>The Wilmington VA Medical Center, 1601 Kirkwood Highway, Wilmington, DE intends to issue a design/build contract for Project #460-10-204, Ground Floor Halls and Walls. The project consists of:    

Renovating the corridors on the ground floor of B-1 from the elevator lobby to the newly renovated corridor in B-17 (which starts at the cross corridor doors near room 182); Room 193, Room 193A and the elevator lobby itself from in front of the elevators to the double door leading into the Clinical Addition.  Work in Room 193 includes building a small storage room of about 8x14 about 6 out from the existing counter.
There will be four deductive bid alternates:  
1.  The storage room which is to be constructed in Room 193.
2.  Renovation of the Elevator Lobby.
3.  Renovation of the portion of the corridor leading to the Chapel.
4.  Renovation of rooms 193 & 193A.
The flooring, ceilings, light fixtures and sprinkler heads are to be replaced.  New handrails and bumper guards are to be installed in the main corridor from the elevator lobby to the double doors leading into B-17.  Existing signage is to be removed and reinstalled.  All interior design choices are to be coordinated with the VA Environmental Management Service.  The walls are to be painted.  Door frames are to be stripped before painting.  Any door hinges which have been painted are to be replaced with like kind.  The counter and cabinet work, including the metal lockers, in room 193 is to be replaced.  The cabinet work and counter is to be similar to and equal to or better than that which was installed in the newly renovated CLC.  The doors to the lower cabinets are to swing 180 degrees.  Overhead cabinets are to be added above the replaced counter and cabinet work.  The existing sink and fixture is to be reused.  The existing coffee machine is to be reused.  Provide new, appropriate type electrical receptacles above the counter.  The construction of the storage room may require moving supply and /or return air vents.  Note in the design anything attached to the walls which has to be relocated.  The design and construction of the replacement counter and area is to include a full size refrigerator with a brushed stainless steel finish.  A good quality residential type refrigerator with ice maker is acceptable.  A microwave which matches the refrigerator is to be provided and installed.  

All of the flooring in the corridor and room 193 is asbestos contaminated.  Include asbestos abatement and the VA asbestos abatement specifications in the design.  Access through the corridor must be maintained during construction and abatement.  The ceiling of the corridor is to be replaced with a 2 X 2 dropped ceiling.  The lights are to be 2 x 2 T-8 fluorescent fixtures similar to the ones used in the new CLC renovation except that they are not to be dropped basket types except by approval of the VA.  Lowering the ceiling slightly will be considered as a last resort.  Some utilities above the ceilings may have to be moved.  The designer is responsible for determining that there is room enough above the ceiling for recessed fixtures.  The criteria used to calculate the light spacing to provide the appropriate light level is to be provided to the VA.  If it is necessary to move a fixture out of the chosen pattern to avoid obstructions above the ceiling VA approval is necessary.  Rewiring and new conduit may be needed.  New light switches are to be installed.  The appropriate number of fixtures will be installed on emergency power.  The pattern chosen for the corridor fixtures is to be approved by the VA.

The drinking fountain protruding into the corridor near the elevators is to be replaced with one which does not protrude and meets the VA standards.

<p>Pertinent technical characteristics for F3HSK10189A001</p>
<p>The United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Global Operations Center (GOC), Bldg 522, Offutt AFB, a below-ground Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) protected Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) requires an integrated redundant line of site radio communications system to support secure and non-secure voice communications to aircraft within 200 Miles of Offutt AFB over Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio frequency (RF) channels. The communications team operating within the USSTRATCOM GOC require the ability to merge existing voice conferences on the local non-secure telephone switch with the radio channel provided by this solution, necessitating a bidirectional telecommunications interface between the radio solution and existing Raytheon Non-Secure Digital Small Switch 2A (DSS-2A).</p>
<p>&bull; The radio must support three modes of operation, specifically, the first being the voice interface over the non-secure Raytheon Digital Small Switch 2A (DSS-2A) switch, the second being a backup mode of operations utilizing an audio communications interface to be installed at the user console, and the third being a tertiary backup mode of operations utilizing an audio communications interface to be installed at the radio location. <br />&bull; When accessed from the user console or radio location the user requires the ability to hear the selected radio channel, inject voice over a push-to-talk handset, and control the selection of the specific radio network/frequency.<br />&bull; Redundancy Definition: The system is required to be designed and integrated to be redundant such that the failure of no single component renders the system non-available to the operator.<br />&bull; Housing/Mech/HVAC: <br />o The components of the system must be capable of being housed within a single 44 rack unit (RU) tall, 19" Rack mountable width, 24" deep equipment rack. <br />o The components of the system must be capable of being powered from some combination of power available from the existing redundant 120/208VAC Wye configured power system. <br />o The system shall require no greater than 4 Tons of Cooling from the Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) to maintain satisfactory operational temperatures.<br />&bull; Technical Attributes of System Telecommunications Interface: The radio solution must be connected to the Bldg 522 Raytheon Non-Secure DSS-2A telephone switch as the primary method of user operation. The interfaces provided by the switch is a 600 Ohm balanced audio input, 600 Ohm balanced audio output, an E Lead tied to -48VDC through a detector circuit sensing current flow through a SGND signal ground for identification of outgoing circuit activation, and a normally open contact closure to signal the users push to talk action on the handset when transmitting.<br />&bull; Crypto: The integrated system must be capable of being operated primarily in the non-secure mode, however also supporting future operations for secure voice up to the Top Secret level through the use of an National Security Agency (NSA) approved cryptographic algorithm compatible with the currently deployed radios in the Department of Defense (PSC-5, AN/PRC-117F, etc) while also supporting modern approved cryptographic algorithms (MEDLEY, etc).<br />&bull; Net Control: The integrated product must be capable of being tuned to any frequency from 300-350Mhz range with a tuning selectivity of no greater than 100kHz.<br />&bull; Frequency of Operation: The integrated product must be capable of UHF operations transmitting and receiving utilizing Amplitude Modulation (AM) in the 300-350MHZ frequency range.<br />&bull; Transmit and Receive Power: At the point of radio installation the integrated system must provide 50Watts Peak Envelope Power (PEP) in AM mode, and be capable of receiving an intelligible signal at -110dBm received signal with 70% AM and 10dB Signal to Noise and Distortion (SINAD).<br />&bull; Antenna Interface: The intended antenna for this solution is the Wade Antenna TACO D-2114 dual UHF antenna located approximately 300 feet from the radio location over an RF cabling path characterized at 5.5dB of loss at 300MHz. The integrated product must be capable of being interfaced to existing Andrews RF Cable Heliax LDF-50A through an N-Type bulkhead for the primary and secondary radio frequency connections.<br />&bull; Electromagnetic Pulse Protection: The intended utilization of this radio is through an electromagnetically harsh environment mandating the radio be installed in a Mil-Std-188-125-1 EMP protected facility. No portion of the integrated solution shall compromise the protection of the facility. Any RF connections between the radio and the antenna location will be through existing facility RF Band-pass Filters (K&amp;L Microwave 8B114-312.5/x-175-NP/N) providing a center frequency of 312.5MHZ and an operational pass band of 175MHz. No active radio components will be installed outside of the facility (such as at antenna location) unless certified as Mil-Std-188-125 and not requiring external power for operation.<br />&bull; TEMPEST: As the intended facility is a TS SCIF the integrated radio product is required to be either TEMPEST compliant or installed in an equipment rack that is TEMPEST certified (no larger than 8'h x 2'w x 2'd weighing &lt;1000lbs). For reasons of system electromagnetic protection and TEMPEST it is required that the cabling interconnecting the integrated radio product and the telephone switch is over non-conductive fiber optic cabling. For reasons of system electromagnetic protection and TEMPEST it is required that the cabling interconnecting the integrated radio product with the user console equipment be over non-conductive fiber optic cabling.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems, Picatinny, NJ, 07806 is conducting a Market Survey to locate potential manufacturers to produce improved bandoleers.  Potential manufacturers would be responsible for: attaining raw materials, fabricating the final bandoleer product to a Government Tech Data Package (TDP), including acceptance tests and certifications, and final delivery of bandoleers to CONUS locations in support of ammunition pack-out operations.  The projected production rate is 325,000 Bandoleer units per month.  The improved bandoleer is a textile bag with carry strap utilized to pack and carry 5.56mm ammunition.  The bandoleer body is formed with 5.0oz (approx.) needlepunch polyester material (dimensions of approx. 19.25 x 12.625) that is folded to form the body. The body is folded such that a pocket flap is formed, resulting in an overall 19.25 length and 6.125 height.  Seven parallel plunge-style ultrasonic weld seams total, 6.125 in length each, are used to seal the ends of the body as well as define four equal size pockets across the bag length. Each welded seam has a patter consisting of a single row of welds, each approximately 0.0625 in diameter with 0.250 center-to -center spacing.  Additionally, the end welds are double width (two rows, 0.250 spacing between) and secure between the polyester body layers, a 50 long and 1.375 wide MIL-T-13452 polypropylene yarn strap. Ultrasonic welds/seams are inspected using test procedures in ASTM-D-6193, ASTM-D-1683, and ASTM-D-5034.  The final design has been qualified by the US Army ARDEC; no redesigns will be considered.  As an alternate to ultrasonic welding, sewing may be utilized only if proven cost effective by potential suppliers. 




SPECIFICATIONS:  This item shall be manufactured to a US owned Technical Data Package (TDP).  


PLANNED ACQUISITION:  325,000 Bandoleers per month.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information including current product literature, illustrations, drawings and relevant company background/experience. Upon response, a detailed TPD will be provided to those interested.  Information submissions should include available technology and equipment, facilitization costs, amortization schedule, raw material costs per unit, and final burdened unit costs.  Information submissions must be received NLT 30 calendar days of this publication date.  Responses to this notice should be directed to: U.S. Army, ATTN: Bradley Borek, Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or bradley.borek@us.army.mil or 973-724-2362.  All information supplied will be considered company proprietary, unless otherwise specified by the company or available from other sources without restriction.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part any private sector input as a result of this market survey. Please include company name, address, telephone number, email address, technical point of contact, Company Size (please specify as either Large, Foreign, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business), brochures/literature.

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Reproductive Health (DRH), Women's Health and Fertility Branch, (WHFB), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is requesting information to determine the availability of qualified contractors to collect, manage, monitor, and perform some analyses while ensuring the timeliness and quality of the data reported by U.S. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) programs (e.g., clinics) to the CDC. As mandated by the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (FCSRCA), P.L. 102-493, U.S. ART programs must report all ART cycles, even those discontinued before all steps were undertaken, along with outcomes to the CDC annually. The FCSRCA also mandates that CDC publish an annual report of ART pregnancy success rates along with the embryo laboratory certification status of each program. Programs that do not report are not in compliance with the FCSRCA and are listed in the annual report as non-reporters.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>In 2002, two million women of reproductive age were infertile. There were 142,435 ART cycles reported and 43,412 live-birth deliveries resulting from ART procedures performed in the U.S. and its territories in 2007. <br />CDC's primary objectives in developing the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) are (1) to publish the mandated annual surveillance report for Congress; (2) to provide ART consumers with an accurate and standardized resource for high-quality information about ART procedures and outcomes; and (3) to conduct studies on other questions regarding ART, including safety and efficacy, birth weight, and preterm delivery<br />Project requirements<br />The contractor shall use the NASS. The contractor shall collect, manage, and maintain ART data; develop and implement appropriate data validation strategies; perform some statistical analyses; assess and implement procedures to ensure data quality; and generate required datasets (multiple formats). Activities also include developing technical documentation, training materials, modifying the data collection system, developing and maintaining an electronic tracking system on ART programs, and providing training and technical support to the CDC and ART programs. The contractor shall collaborate with CDC partner organizations; facilitate, document, and participate in meetings; coordinate and conduct site visits; draft reports; and attend conferences as directed. The contractor must address all NASS requirements along with supporting and maintaining the import of data from other electronic data collection systems. The contractor shall ensure and maintain data security and assist with the preparation of materials needed to gain human subjects protections, information systems security, and Office of Management and Budget approvals.</p>
<p>The Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, shall furnish all personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies, materials and any subcontract agreements and procedures necessary to assist CDC in meeting the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (FCSRCA), P.L. 102-493.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance<br /></strong>The intent is to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for six (6) phases. The period of performance will be from the date of award through 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement information sought<br /></strong>Interested businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit an electronic copy of their capability statement, addressing the information regarding respondents': (a) Corporate experience and management capability including key staff expertise, including their availability, and experience; (b) Current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; and (c) Examples of current and completed relevant projects.

Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available and requests for the same will be disregarded.</p>
<p><br />1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Purpose</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is issuing this RFI to obtain information from industry experts regarding the development of a Universal Product Code (UPC) clearinghouse. This clearinghouse would be used to support Authorized Product List (APL) file transfers for WIC State agencies that deliver benefits via Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), and potentially for any State agency delivering benefits using paper checks or vouchers. FNS is also interested in obtaining additional information on different options for operating, maintaining, and enhancing the FNS National UPC database.</p>
<p>1.2 Organization</p>
<p>The WIC Program is administered by FNS. FNS provides grant funding and issues regulations which are utilized by WIC State agencies that operate the WIC Program in conjunction with local clinics. The WIC Program provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk. The program operates throughout the 50 States, in the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and in 34 Indian Tribal Organizations.<br /><br />WIC State agencies are required to authorize eligible foods on their WIC food list by federal regulations at 7 C.F.R. Part 246. Under these regulations, State agencies must review food products for eligibility in accordance with Federal regulations and State agency policies. State agencies are not required to authorize all food products eligible under federal regulations, but generally select foods based on factors such as cost, availability and acceptability to participants. After review, the State agency develops a list of food items available to WIC participants for purchase. State agencies require authorized vendors (i.e., stores authorized to provide WIC foods to participants) to ensure that only authorized food items are purchased. Many of these vendors have programmed their point of sale systems to identify WIC approved foods and their associated Universal Product Code (UPC) or Price Look-Up (PLU) code as they are scanned at the checkout; however, some vendors still rely on their checkout clerks to ensure only authorized WIC products are approved for purchase. WIC State agencies that operate EBT systems provide authorized vendors with an electronic file containing the State agency's current authorized products list (APL). This file complies with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X9.93 Part 2 file format requirements. In State agencies that have implemented EBT systems, as products are scanned at the checkout lane the UPC or PLU is matched to the State specific APL list. Food items that match the APL and the specific quantity of a food category/subcategory associated with a WIC EBT card are approved. Unmatched items are denied for purchase. Each item on the APL is linked to a specific food category and subcategory. For EBT State agencies, the APL is revised as needed to add or remove WIC products and the APL is typically made available daily on each State agency's file transfer server that is accessed by authorized WIC vendors or their providers. All State agencies review their Authorized Product List on an annual or biennial cycle.</p>
<p>Additional information on the WIC Program is available on the FNS WIC webpage at http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic and http://www.fns.usda.gov/apd/library/wic_ebt_docs.htm</p>
<p>1.3 Background</p>
<p>The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 required FNS to develop a National UPC (NUPC) database to serve as a national repository of WIC approved food items. The NUPC database allows WIC State agencies, retailers, and manufacturers, to add products to the database via an interactive webpage. WIC State agencies may also add products to the NUPC database by uploading files which contain data derived from their list of authorized products. In either case, the system prevents duplication of products upon entry into the system. WIC State agencies can review the products in the database, conduct additional research with the manufacturer if deemed necessary, select those items they wish to approve and download a State agency APL file. FNS is interested in the development of a clearinghouse capability that would consolidate individual APL's from the 90 State agencies and make one or more of those APL's available for electronic transfer to WIC retail vendors authorized by State agencies. At present, there are more than 49,000 WIC approved food vendors. However, WIC vendors that have been authorized to support multiple State agencies would be able to download all required APL files through a single connection; therefore we expect the number of users to be substantially lower than 49,000. FNS is also interested in generating suggestions for enhancements to the NUPC database as discussed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1.4 Scope</p>
<p>FNS is looking to create the capability for WIC authorized vendors to go to a single site to download all the State APL files the vendor may require to support daily operations. The clearinghouse must be able to support authorized WIC vendors or their providers (e.g., acquirers or electronic cash register re-sellers) connecting daily to retrieve from one to 90 different APL files. The APL is distributed daily to WIC authorized vendors in each State now delivering WIC via EBT. Authorized vendors load the APL data to their cash register systems to enable them to match food items that are scanned at the checkout lane to the food prescriptions linked to an EBT card. Items that do not appear on the APL are not permitted to be redeemed. While paper check or voucher systems at present do not require UPC data in the same manner that WIC EBT requires, we understand that the food retail vendors have interest in getting electronic APLs from States utilizing paper systems. <br />Conceptually, the APL clearinghouse is envisioned to be a file server based application using a common transfer process such as the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The needs of registered retail vendor users would be supported with administration of user access via a web page interface. The specific technology may differ if it can accomplish the task as defined. The web pages would enable authorized vendors to self-register, provide a minimum credential (e.g., a valid WIC Vendor ID), and permit them to designate which State agency APL files they require. It is expected that the FTP site will be able to support an automated connection which does not require manual logon (i.e. machine to machine) to allow the various APL files to be obtained. A manual download initiated by a user of a one or more APL files may also be necessary. The clearinghouse site is expected to push file to users initially, rather files will be placed into a file folder which is accessed by the user with an appropriate password. The capability to push files or data may be considered as an enhancement but present EBT system operations are all file based using the ANSI X9.93 file formats. <br />The clearinghouse site must be able to receive transmissions of State APL files, either from the National UPC Database or from a State Agency. Most operating EBT State agencies update their FTP site nightly although changes may happen less frequently. State agencies are expected to transmit a copy of their APL file to the national clearinghouse FTP site on a daily basis and more frequently if their APL's are updated. At present, the specific format of each State agency APL is consistent with X9.93 Part 2, but the version in use may vary between State Agencies and they may contain State specific features, such as maximum price for cost containment purposes. Cost containment data, often called a "Not to Exceed" price, is not contained in the NUPC database due to its high degree of variability. Furthermore, State agencies are not required to disclose this pricing data (an option supported by the ANSI X9.93 standard). <br />After establishing an operational APL file transfer capability, FNS envisions the potential for adding other EBT related file transfers. At present, two technologies have been utilized to deliver WIC EBT. In the smartcard (offline) environment, file transfers between State agencies and authorized vendors include the APL file, a Hot Card List (HCL), a Claim file, and an Auto Reconciliation file. In the magnetic card (online) environment, file transfers between State agencies and authorized vendors include the APL and an Auto Reconciliation file. FNS is also interested in a process which consolidates the various State Agency APL files into a single national APL file that identifies each food item by UPC, product description, and benefit quantity as well as each State agency that has approved the item. This could include up to 90 different State agency specific flags and must accurately reflect any variances between State agency APL's. Since State agencies do not use standard product descriptions and benefit units for the same product UPC, such a national level file would need to address these differences. For example, some State agencies consider a gallon of milk, UPC 123412341234, to be deducted as 1.0 gallons from the WIC benefit prescription. Others would issue benefits in quarts so this same UPC will require a benefit unit of 4.0 (4 quarts = 1 gallon).<br />In addition to the Clearinghouse capability described above, FNS is interested in identifying alternative models or new ideas from industry for operating, maintaining, and enhancing the NUPC database either in conjunction with the APL clearinghouse or independently. For example, ongoing operation of the NUPC might be accomplished utilizing a "Service Option" model with the systems residing in either the FNS data center or another external location. The provider of this service would operate this service for authorized users but the system would not be subject to federal system security, authentication and web site design requirements that are applicable to federally operated systems. However, FNS will require the ability to approve the overall service capability and subsequent enhancements. <br />Other enhancements to the NUPC database might include, but are not limited to, the following: <br />&bull; Development of a rules based engine to validate product nutritional information against WIC standards; <br />&bull; Import of product specific information such as nutritional data or photographs from external sources; <br />&bull; Automatic updates of external databases such as the WIC Works Formula database when changes occur within the NUPC. The WIC Works formula database may be viewed at: http://riley.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/formulas/FormulaSearch.php.<br />&bull; Development of a capability to track and record changes to the NUPC database; and/or a method to enhance data integrity while continuing to allow State agencies to add, edit, and delete UPC records. <br />&bull; Alternative web security processes that allow verification of users from different user classes. For example, we would not expect product APL file access to be made readily available widely via internet or web technology. It is critical to assure that the data utilized by retail vendor chains is not compromised. However, there may be ways to segment user access so that general web users may obtain access to the UPC data. Federal systems must adhere to USDA standards for external user authentication; presently we use the USDA level 1 and level 2 eAuthentication processes for validating users prior to granting them access to the National UPC database.<br />FNS would also like to consider any other concepts which may not have been included above but which have the potential to improve system performance when deployed in an operational environment. <br />Comments on alternate pricing and maintenance support are explicitly sought from responders to this RFI. Contractual performance requirements must be established with appropriate reporting and procedures for remedying performance levels below those established by contract. In addition, FNS asks responders to consider the present statutes governing WIC EBT implementation when developing pricing alternatives. These statutes specifically prohibit the imposition of EBT related costs onto authorized WIC vendors (retailers). FNS will therefore be unable to consider any model or approach which includes a recurring "subscription fee" to be paid by retailers. On the other hand, retailers may be willing to pay for "value added" services or capabilities as an optional service feature.</p>
<p>1.5 Technical Requirements<br />The data contained in the NUPC database and individual APL files is not protected information which requires substantial security features. However, the systems must be able to protect against internet or web site intrusion and/or tampering with the files or any other component of the systems. The present APL files used by State agencies conform to the X9.93 Part 2 WIC UPC/PLU record file format. The files are a text based file. FNS is working with industry and State agencies to align the APLs with X9.93 2008 but several EBT operations are using an older version of X9.93. The current NUPC is a SQL database with a web based interface allowing authorized users to add, edit, and delete UPC records. A State agency may approve individual UPCs and download this in the X9.93 format with some exceptions such as pricing data for cost containment. The interface also allows users to search and select records based on unique criteria. Selected records may then be reported to an Excel, PDF or text format. State agency users are also able to upload files containing UPC data they currently use. The National UPC database upload/download file format is available at: <br />http://www.fns.usda.gov/apd/Library/WIC_EBT/WIC_NUPC_DB_System_Upload_Download_spec_Nov192009.pdf</p>
<p>2.0 Questions related to development of an automated Clearinghouse for APL files</p>
<p>a. Should this system be developed as an enhancement to the UPC database or independent of the NUPC as a standalone system?<br />b. What type of user validation should be employed to facilitate vendor access yet prevent unauthorized persons from accessing files in the clearinghouse? <br />c. Is FTP the best protocol for use in this environment or should another more secure protocol be considered? <br />d. Given that there are a limited number of updates to each APL daily, should a messaging system to transmit only modified or added records be adopted (as opposed to transferring the entire APL file on daily basis)? <br />e. While system availability is not a critical consideration, availability is expected to exceed 99%. Is a redundant capability required? <br />f. What pricing alternatives are available for both the development and the operation of an APL clearinghouse capability?</p>
<p>3.0 Questions related to the operation and maintenance of the NUPC database</p>
<p>a. Are there commercially available data sources which contain unique product data (UPC, Product description, Package size, etc) and which could be used to populate the NUPC with food items which are potentially WIC eligible (both national and regional brands)? <br />b. Please describe alternate models for hosting, operating, and maintaining, the NUPC database which facilitates user access while maintaining data security. <br />c. While each State agency has unique data requirements and each includes different data elements in their APL, how is data integrity maintained while allowing State agencies the flexibility to satisfy individual requirements and simultaneously share data across State agencies? <br />d. What pricing alternatives are available for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the NUPC database? <br />e. What are the advantages and disadvantages of allowing public access to the NUPC database? How would such access be managed? Would public access affect system design?</p>
<p>4.0 Questions related to the development of enhancements to the NUPC database</p>
<p>a. How might technologies and databases similar to those utilized by the iphone application "RedLaser" be utilized to capture product data and update the NUPC? <br />b. What are the advantages and disadvantages resulting from partnerships with online data sources similar to www.foodessentials.com or www.dailyburn.com?<br />c. What level of effort is required to develop a "rules based software engine" to automate the process of validating nutritional and ingredient information in order to ensure products in the NUPC database meet Federal requirements for WIC approved foods? <br />d. Are there comprehensive commercial data sources capable of providing product photographs, nutritional information, and item ingredients, for import into the NUPC? <br />e. What level of effort is required to automate the update of external databases, similar to WIC Works, as changes are made to the NUPC?</p>

<SUBJECT>PROJECT MANAGER FOR FISHER INDEPENDENT TRAP SURVEY PROJECT, ST CROIX, USVI
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-10-15972SLW
<RESPDATE>072710
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a notice to acquire services to acquire services to provide a Project Manager for Fishery Independent Trap Survey Project St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. The available data sources and assessment techniques have been found to be limited for the US Caribbean. As a result, consensus has been reached that data limitations preclude comprehensive stock assessment for most reef fisheries in the US Caribbean. SEFSC (in conjunction with HMS, CFMC, and State and Territorial Managers) is in the process of improving the fishery dependent data collection protocols for both the recreational and commercial sectors. However, a well designed fishery independent survey provides almost immediate benefit for assessing fisheries and ecosystems while also serving as a barometer of the fishery dependent data collection techniques in development. This project is designed to be the first comprehensive fishery independent survey of any of the island in the US Caribbean. This study will survey St. Croix as it is an isolated island platform with adequate baseline mapping/habitat characterization information. The project will work cooperatively with many of the fishers on the island, and will utilize standard fishing gear built to the fishers specifications. Coordination of this extensive survey during the implementation phase is a very complex and demanding role that will require intensive concentration, organization, and leadership skills. We are therefore contracting a "project manager" to assume this role. The NMFS is executing a fishery independent survey of the St. Croix shelf, to serve as a proof of concept for a larger US Caribbean-wide survey effort. This survey will utilize the resources of the local fishing communities, universities, resource managers, and existing mapping and socioeconomic data to execute the first comprehensive spatial survey in the region. The results will provide immediate guidance to the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC) and lay the groundwork for resource assessments and implementation of the program in other regions facing similary fisheries data collection issues. This project will also monitor the fishes of the US Virgin Islands for ecosystem assessment of coral reefs. The contractor requested here shall be responsible for the implementation of a cooperative fishery independent survey: procuring, organizing, and overseeing resources and personnel to execute a successful survey. <br />The government knows of only one source Mr. Henry E. Tonnemacker, Seven Seas Limited that is capable of providing this service: Mr. Tonnemacher, possesses a unique suite of skills, certifications, and experience that will ensure successful completion of this complex and demanding project.<br />Mr. Tonnemacher has lived and worked on the Island of St. Croix for almost 30 years and has gained extensive experience with both the community and natural environment of the study location. This is a critical requirement because the survey will be logistically complicated and dependent on weather and sea conditions that may delay or lengthen the survey period. Mr. Tonnemacher has working knowledge of the island, its docks, ports, fishers, boats and roads; which is also required. Mr. Tonnemacher has experience working directly with fishers and fishing gear which is extremely important to the successful execution of this survey.<br />Should the government have gaps in the ability to complete the survey utilizing commercial fishers, or should safety or logistical issues arise, Mr. Tonnemacher possesses a 100 ton Master Coast Guard License and has extensive boating and fishing experience, and has an extensive network of local contacts for both back-up vessels and/or personnel. This experience also makes him uniquely qualified to work with fishers who are working collaboratively on this project.<br />Mr. Tonnemacher has a strong background in biological sciences and has experience working independently and in a leadership role conducting coral reef surveys and fishing tagging studies. This will be critical to the successful completion of all phases of this resource survey.
<p>SCUBA certification and experience is critical for this project for taking photographs of the survey in progress, retrieving snagged or broken gear, and verifying habitat. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs.</p>
<p><br />1. Contractor shall be familiar with the St. Croix area and have extensive experience working on the Island.<br />2. Contractor shall have 100 Ton Master Coast Guard License and extensive boating and fishing experience<br />3. Contractor shall have a strong background in biological science, including a leadership role in conducting coral reef resource surveys and fish tagging studies<br />4. Contractor shall be a certified SCUBA Diver<br />5. Contractor shall have appropriate business framework and experience hiring and overseeing biologists and fishers<br />6. Contractor shall have experience working directly with fishing communities and fishing gear<br />7. Contractor shall have excellent leadership, oral and written communications skills, and be a competent photographer<br />8. Contractor shall have prior experience working with on similar projects.</p>
<p><br />Information shall also include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service. Interested parties must respond within (7) seven days after publication of this notice. The government knows of only one source. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. Faxed information can be sent to 816-274-6983 or physically sent Department of Commerce, Attn: Sharon Walker, 601 E. 12th St, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vemco, Inc for the purchase of satellite tracking tags, transmitter product number V16-6H-A69-1303.
<p><br />The Gulf of Mexico Sturgeon was listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act in 1995. The 2009 Gulf Sturgeon Working Group set research objectives in order to fulfill the data nees of future assessments. The primary objective was to obtain reliable estimates of natural mortality and abundance. In order to attain these objectives, a standardized protocol for estimating mortality was implemented in which Vemco VR2 W receivers are&nbsp;used as "gates" at the mouths of seven major rivers defined as critical habitat for this species. Each year for five years, five Gulf sturgeon from each river will be implanted with Vemco V16 transmitters. Because Vemco receivers are proprietary, other types of transmitters may not be able to pick up Vemco signals and allowing Gulf sturgeon to leave the rivers undetected. Reliable tag detections are crucial for the success of the project.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice&nbsp;is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the Satellite Tracing Transmitter Tags&nbsp;may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at (816) 274-6993 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

There is also minor historic architectural work related to clay tile roofing replacement; window and door replacement; painting and incidental related work.<BR><BR>The McMillan Pumping Station serves about 1 million customers daily and is part of a critical water supply infrastructure for the Nations Capital.  It must operate reliably in order to guarantee uninterrupted potable water supply to residents and businesses in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The timing and execution of this project is also critical because the back-up main that covers this service area has developed problems and is in need of immediate repairs. Given the possibility of a catastrophic failure of this major back-up water main, it is paramount that the McMillan Pumping Station stay in service to avoid a disruption of the potable water supply to areas of the distribution system.  Therefore, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:<BR>i.	Project should be completed in 10 months in order that the repair work on the back-up main can commence. <BR>ii.	Equipment downtime in the replacement of variable speed drives and surge control for valve actuators should be minimized.  At least two of the three existing settled water pumps should be available for operation at all times during the execution of outages.<BR>iii.	The existing Anvic drives are obsolete and there is no source of spare parts.  The project requires relocating all three drives with associated wiring and complex control mechanism to a temporary location and making them operational before installing new VFDs.<BR>iv.	Roof repair in a high ceiling plant area and climate control from new HVAC equipment should be completed before delivery of new variable frequency drives.  <BR><BR>Interested 8(a), SDVOB and HUBZone certified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their experience in: <BR>1.	The replacement of medium voltage variable speed Anvic drives and surge control for valve actuators.<BR>2.	The replacement of valve actuators associated with each pump for surge control with electro-hydraulic type actuators.<BR>3.	The installation of building HVAC and provision of temporary cooling in case the new HVAC units are not available so as not to delay electrical work on the drives.<BR>4.	Roof repair and replacement of the clay tile roofing system.<BR>5.	Replacement of historic windows and doors and interior painting.<BR><BR>Capability statements should include the following information:  details of similar projects, to include demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in:<BR>(a)	Performing work within outages of limited duration at a critical infrastructure such as a water treatment plant or pumping station.  The contractor shall plan for limited outages to include the relocation of complete lineup of medium voltage Anvic drives in a way that will not hamper the operation of the pumping station. The relocation of these drives to make room for the new VFDs is the most critical aspect of this project. The existing Anvic drives are obsolete and there is no technical service available from the manufacturer, neither are there sources of spare parts. Hence, there are only a handful of engineers available who are familiar with these drives to provide assistance in case of a problem.<BR>(b)	The selection, installation and operation of medium voltage variable frequency drives. The contractor shall provide VFDs that are most adaptable to the characteristics of the large induction motors and vertical turbine pumps based on performance specifications.<BR>(c)	Knowledge of different configurations of VFDs and show the ability to convert motor connections to suit the needed application.  The contractor shall provide VFDs with the best quality, performance and delivery schedule.<BR>(d)	Layout for temporary work, safely working around exposed wires, termination and testing of medium voltage cables.<BR>(e)	The replacement of surge control valve actuator systems serving large motors and vertical turbine pumps.<BR>(f)	The selection, installation and operation of HVAC equipment. The medium voltage variable frequency drives (VFDs) will not be energized until climate control is achieved within the pumping station.<BR><BR>Narratives shall be no longer than ten pages.  Email responses are preferred.  <BR><BR>Comments will be shared with the Government and the project design team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence.<BR><BR>Comments may be in any format, but must include the offerors name, phone number, and email address.<BR><BR>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: This is not a solicitation.  As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) market research process, this is a request for information (RFI) to assist us in developing an acquisition strategy for a potential future requirement associated with the Strategic Asset Management (SAM) pilot project.  More specifically, VA is seeking industry input related to performance of an Independent Technical Assessment (ITA) of VA's Strategic Asset Management (SAM) pilot project.

BACKGROUND:  VA's SAM system is charged with establishing a centralized repository and tool for requisitioning, purchasing, tracking and disposing of assets, supply inventories and related work management in a single system accessible throughout the department.  VA is implementing IBM's Maximo Enterprise Suite as its enterprise asset management platform for personal property assets, supply inventories, and work management.  VA is currently working with a contractor on the development of a SAM pilot capability at VA facilities in Milwaukee, WI.  The SAM pilot project has recently completed its critical design review and is scheduled to undergo a user review of the capability developed to date in August 2010.  Assuming a successful user review a "Go Live" date of March 2011 is anticipated for the complete pilot capability.

The scope of the anticipated task is to perform an ITA of VA's Strategic Asset Management (SAM) pilot project  The functional areas of expertise required to perform this task include Acquisition Support, Measurement & Analysis, Performance & Dependability, Predictability by Construction, Process & Performance Improvement, Risk & Opportunity Management, Security & Survivability, Software Architecture, Software Product Lines, Systems Interoperability and Ultra-Large-Scale Systems.

The contractor will support the SAM project office and VA senior leadership by conducting an ITA of the SAM system and SAM project management processes.  The goal of this task is to assess risks related to system deployment and to provide recommended actions based on assessment of the risks.

The areas explored by the ITA will be: (1) People including process knowledge, product knowledge, organization knowledge/context, and program history; (2) Process including technical processes and management processes; and (3) Product including usability, deployability, and maintainability.

Specifically, the ITA shall examine:  (1) Software engineering practices; conformance to the VA Program Management Accountability System (PMAS).  (2) Relationship between project office, contractor(s), test community, user community; personnel stability and morale; acceptance and implementation of the project's operational structure.  (3) Appropriateness of processes-including, but not limited to: CM/DM, systems engineering, document management, risk management, change management, integration, test, QA, contractor/subcontractor management.  (4) Feasibility of and performance against current and proposed schedules; viability of test environment/test approach (informal, formal DT and formal OT).

The ITA will require a post-award conference and a brief environment scan to familiarize the contractor with the project (operational structure, etc.) followed by a review of project documentation and interviews with key staff in Milwaukee, WI, Washington, DC and other VA sites where project support is provided.

<DESC>The 55th Contracting Office, Offutt AFB, NE intends to enter into a "No Cost" agreement with Boeing, within the next 30 days, to make available to USSTRATCOM a "Tool" that provides the ability to conduct rapid analysis of ballistic missile defense designs resulting in the fast turn-around of analyses such that cases can be prepared and executed and results presented in real time. This analysis will supply first order assessment of force structure and capability needs, allowing Models to run rapidly and employ user-friendly interfaces. The Tool will also provide results consistent with existing BMDS modeling tools, support use of classified data and the export graphics for use within common office automation tools that USSTRATCOM requires; while providing a balance between simulation fidelity, performance insight and speed of operation. This Tool was designed to allow the user interface and visual displays to facilitate rapid set up, execution and presentation of results that facilitates operator use and understanding of results.

<DESC>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Facilities, Security and Contracting  has a requirement, in support of OPMs mission to increase the competitive employment of Americans with disabilities within the federal government, to create a shared register of people with disabilities from which federal agencies may directly access qualified candidates for professional positions.  OPM intends to issue a non-competitive award that will result in a contract to Bender Consulting Services, Inc. located 3 Penn Center West Suite 223, Pittsburgh, PA 15276.   The nature of this effort requires a contractor to develop a shared register of Americans with Disabilities, which consists of those individuals who could be hired by a federal agency using the Schedule A hiring authority as a pilot program not to exceed a period of one (1) year.  Bender Consulting Services, Inc. has the capability of creating a register that will populate 50 or more professional Schedule A qualified individuals per month from both private sector companies and Federal Government agencies per month.  This requirement is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items.  The authority for this award is FAR 13.106-1 (b) (1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via e-mail to Vito F. Bertucci at vito.bertucci@opm.gov.  Verification of receipt of electronic transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. All OPM contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to execution of award.  If no competitive responses are received, an award will be made to Bender Consulting Services, Inc.

<CONTACT>Andrea  Katz, Phone 202.874.9933, Email andrea.katz@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with SAS of Cary, North Carolina, to conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate how the OCCs current SAS environment can be optimized to improve performance of the SAS applications used by the OCCs Economics Department.  

The POC and its results will be part of a larger market research effort that the OCC is conducting to explore possible solutions to the existing performance and storage constraints associated with the Economics Departments data analytics activities.  

SAS software is a major component of the OCC Economics Departments infrastructure for data analytics. The OCC has been a customer of SAS for over 15 years, and SAS products are heavily used for research and data analytics by the Economics Department.   

The  OCC s Economics Department has been conducting increasingly complex and processing-intensive analytics on increasingly large data sets; and as a result, performance of some of its SAS tools has degraded, and data storage requirements have grown significantly.  The OCC is interested in understanding what types of changes to its existing SAS environment, including the technical architecture supporting SAS, might be necessary to improve the performance of the Economics Department SAS-based research and analysis.  

For the reasons identified above, the OCC has made a preliminary determination that SAS is the only responsible source to conduct this POC on behalf of the Economics Department in a cost-effective and results-effective manner.

The period of performance associated with the proof of concept is anticipated to be approximately three months (current projected schedule: September 13, 2010 through December 13, 2010).
  
This notice of intent to issue a sole source contract to SAS is not a request for competitive quotes, and no solicitation documents are available.  

Any information received by the OCC in response to this notice will be considered solely for reviewing the merits of its preliminary determination that SAS is the only responsible source for the POC. Final determination regarding the issuance of the sole source contract as described herein is solely at the discretion of the OCC.  

Any written response to this notice from potential offerors who believe they are equipped to conduct the described POC better than SAS should include full costing information as well as a detailed narrative containing sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capacity to meet the requirement.

                    in accordance with 41 CFR 101-45.317.1.

The following sub-factors will be evaluated:</p>
<p>a. Quality of Product or Service - The degree to which the Contractor can show the ability to meet all service level agreements and ensure customer satisfaction.<br />b. Timeliness of Performance - The degree in which the Contractor meets established schedules or milestones. The Cotnractor will describe how it will staff the requirements throughout the life of the contract.<br />c. Cost Control - The degree in which the Contractor completes repairs within the established time period.<br />d.

The work includes installation of a new motor generator/conditioner system and affiliated electrical upgrades, including new transformer and/or other structural modifications necessary to accommodate motor generator equipment, including concrete slab replacement/reinforcement and selective demolition of adjacent interior structures. Project will require replacement of existing RTUs with new, more energy efficient, units that meet USPS design and energy standards with the addition of one new RTU to handle the increased heat load due to additional mail sorting equipment. Project will reuse existing ductwork where available and add side diffusers to permit cool air to be delivered to the entire space in place of the current vertical diffusers which are not aligned with the equipment aisles. Project should recognize site/facility space limitations and the impact of replacement components so as to minimize construction costs and avoid disruption of facility operations. The presence of asbestos and lead-based paint has been confirmed in the area of work and contractor will be required to obtain the services of a Certified Licensed abatement/ remediation contractor to identify and remove asbestos and/or lead-based paint in areas affected by work. Information on the asbestos/lead-based paint abatement contractor is to be submitted to the USPS for approval prior to commencement of work.  The estimated cost of the project is between $2,000,000 and $2,500,000 with construction completion within 270 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered. Project requires Davis Bacon wage rates. Solicitation will be for 30 calendar days and prices shall be good for 60 calendar days after solicitation is closed. To be considered, the company must be financially capable, have a minimum of five years total experience in major electrical generation/distribution upgrades and HVAC upgrades/replacement projects, and have completed two comparable projects within the past five years, one of which may be ongoing.  Comparable projects are defined as HVAC upgrades/replacements at a cost of $1,000,000 or greater and electrical generation/distribution projects at a cost of $2,000,000 or greater.  The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated, in the following order of preference:  experience/performance and capabilities.  The price proposals for only the most qualified contractors will be considered.  The Postal Service will select the offeror that provides the best value to the Postal Service.

<p>&nbsp;<br />PART 3 - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT <br /><br />3. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The Division of Microbiology in the Office of Regulatory Science has a DSM PremiTest Salmonella serotyping system from DSM. The PremiTest for Salmonella is an automated PCR-based serotyping system for Salmonella. The genus Salmonella is divided into 2 species: Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. These 2 species are further divided into 2500+ serotypes: approximately 2560 Salmonella serotypes within S. enterica and 22 within S. bongori. FDA uses serotype information as a way of linking disease in humans to specific foods during foodborne disease outbreaks. In cases where a culture has gone "rough", traditional serotyping is impossible. The PremiTest can serotype pure isolates in a few of hours, thus reducing costs and accelerating the epidemiological process significantly so that outbreak related foods can be quickly removed from the US food supply.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-223-JML and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-44 (July 8, 2010).  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), has a requirement for professional supervision for a required course in the Johns Hopkins/NHGRI Genetic Counseling Training Program (#415.870 JHU).  It is cited in the materials used to achieve American Board of Genetic Counseling Accreditation as an essential component to the program.  The program results from a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the NHGRI.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is 08/26/2010 - 05/31/2011.</p>
<p>This requirement is set-aside for small businesses.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Drawing on resources from two outstanding research institutions, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health, Behavior and Society at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have collaborated to develop a unique genetic counseling graduate program that addresses the growing need for genetic counseling services. The JHU/NHGRI Genetic Counseling Program (GCTP) was established in 1996. Its goals are to prepare graduates to:<br />&bull;	Provide genetic counseling, with an emphasis on clients' psychological and educational needs. <br />&bull;	Conduct social and behavioral research related to genetic counseling.<br />&bull;	Educate health care providers, policy makers and the public about genetics and related health and social issues.</p>
<p>The GCTP distinguishes itself in offering extensive interactive coursework to support completion of high quality, publishable thesis studies. Since its inception, the GCTP has produced a cadre of genetic counselors who broaden the scope of genetic counseling by contributing to a growing research literature that critically examines a variety of aspects of the profession and shapes future directions in the field.</p>
<p>Statement of Work:</p>
<p>Teaching course # 415.870.92 Genetic Counseling Supervision in the JHU/NHGRI Genetic counseling training program.  This course is one of the required genetic counseling courses in the program.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement</p>
<p>Genetic Counseling Supervision is taught as an interactive process intended to monitor the quality of client care, improve clinical skills, and facilitate professional and personal growth of the genetic counseling students. The contractor will provide professional supervision to students enrolled in the Genetic Counseling Graduate Program. The sessions will address the students counseling learning objectives and how well their clinical casework is meeting those objectives.  The students will be graded on a pass/fail basis that is outlined for them in a supervision consent document. This work will be completed May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>Professional supervision involves meeting with seven students weekly for one hour throughout the academic year. A typical supervision session will include an oral case presentation by the student supported by audiotape segments of casework highlighting issues related to learning contract goals.  The contractor will also review brief written case notes.  Students have the opportunity to ask questions, explore alternative interventions, discuss/discover counter-transference themes, address ethical concerns, and receive feedback and suggestions on their therapeutic interventions. <br />Formal evaluations of the student's clinical casework will be conducted at the end of each term.  Evaluation criteria will be based on self-assessment through oral and written case reports, discussion of at least three audiotaped segments of counseling sessions (or role plays) each quarter, exploration of two partial case transcripts each quarter, and the degree to which the student accomplishes the goals set forth in the learning contract.  Students can expect potential benefits of supervision to include improvement of their counseling conceptualization and intervention skills and an increased sense of professional identity. In addition to a grade (P/F) students will receive a complete supervision summary at the end of the year that outlines their work and accomplishments. The course is taught over four 8-week (for a total of 32 weeks) terms extending over the academic year from 8/26/10-5/31/11.</p>
<p>Additionally, the contractor will teach a concurrent Self-Awareness course as part of the supervision requirements of the Genetic Counseling Program. The course will consist of 4 sessions to take place in the first term, between 08/26/10- 10/31/10.<br />Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>NHGRI will supply the meeting rooms for supervision to occur either on the JHU campus or the NIH campus of the program.  The Program Director (PD) will review student progress with the instructor on a quarterly basis or more frequently if students are encountering difficulties.  The PD will submit the grades from the contractor-taught course.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>Supervision reports will be verbally summarized for the PD at the end of each term.  The contractor will keep supervision notes throughout the academic year to be used to compile the written summary at the end of the academic year.  A pass or fail grade will be given to the Director by e-mail correspondence at the end of each term.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</p>
<p>Since services will be delivered on the JHU School of Public Health campus or the NIH campus used by the Genetic Counseling Program, inspection of the site and circumstances will take place at one of these locations.  The site will be inspected for a comfortable setting for the student to present his/her casework and sufficient room for the contractor to be able to take notes and listen to audiotapes in a confidential manner.  The PD will inspect the setting and accept the site according to this criteria. The format for the written supervision summary will be shared with the contractor and will be required as a final document completing the four term course series.  Verbal summaries at the end of each quarter on individual student progress will be required.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The course is taught over four 8-week (for a total of 32 weeks) terms extending over the academic year from 8/26/10-5/31/11.</p>
<p>Additionally, the contractor will teach a concurrent Self-Awareness course as part of the supervision requirements of the Genetic Counseling Program. The course will consist of 4 sessions to take place in the first term, between 08/26/10- 10/31/10.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>-	Past Experience - Eligible applicants must have a minimum of five years providing professional or graduate level supervision around clinical work in genetic counseling; and a minimum of five years teaching coursework related or similar to self-awareness or introduction to professional supervision.<br />-	Degree - Eligible applicants must have a minimum of a master's degree in genetic counseling and preferably further education in clinical counseling.<br />-	Years of Experience - Eligible applicants must have a minimum of ten years of professional experience in the genetic counseling field.</p>
<p>The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.

This award will cover the 2011 Official U.S. Pavilion with an option for organization and management of the 2013 Official U.S. Pavilion.</p>
<p><br />The Paris Air Show</p>
<p>The Paris Air Show (the "Air Show") is the most prestigious show in the world for the aerospace industry, attracting exhibitors, buyers, agents, distributors, and potential investors from all over the world.

In 2009, the Air Show featured 2,000 exhibitors from 48 countries at its location at Le Bourget Airport outside of Paris.</p>
<p>The Official U.S. Pavilion</p>
<p>The Official U.S. Pavilion (the "Pavilion") has been a major export showcase for the U.S. aerospace community. Following the 1995 Air show, the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC) decided to partially privatize the 1997 Official U.S. Pavilion. While USDOC continues to sponsor the Official U.S. Pavilion, its organization and management were handled by a private show organizer with a staff member of USDOC's Office of Aerospace overseeing the contract. In addition to managing the contract, USDOC maintained responsibility for providing support for official delegations visiting the Official U.S. Pavilion, securing the President's personal representative to the show and formulating his schedule and those of senior USDOC officials, and organizing and staffing both an Aerospace Products Literature Center (APLC) and a Business Information Office (BIO) within the Official U.S. Pavilion.</p>
<p><br />A Statement of Work (SOW), as well as the applicable terms and conditions are attached.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency.

<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<DESC>21 July 2010: The purpose of this modification is to add questions and answers.<br /><br />1. Can you tell me how many prong plug you will need, also is there only one outlet for the washer/dryer? Plugs are 4 Prong<br />Do the washer/dryer need to plug into each other? Only one per unit
<p>2. Also I really need to info about DRMO for the haul away of the old appliances.<br />If they are only doing 10 washers per day, then the company will have to haul the washers/dryers to DRMO which is located on Travis AFB. If they are going to do them all in a day then DRMO will have a truck at the dorms location where the company can load the washers/dryers on. Either way the washers/dryers have to be shrink wrapped the on pallets in sets of 2s.</p>
<p>3. The electrical config is 220 volts for the dyers and 110 volts for the washers.</p>

<DESC>21 July 2010: The purpose of this modification is to post questions and answers.<br /><br />Mattresses:<br />1. Do you want foam encasing, which is sturdier on the edges when you sit on the edge, or edge to edge? The edge support on the mattress is a 3" thick, high density, foam encasement.
<p>2. Is this a single sided or double sided mattress? Single Sided nonflippable because of the zippered top</p>
<p>3. Is it acceptable to place a waterproof, bed bug resistant, white zip on cover over the mattress? The reason I ask, some mattresses come with a zip on pillow top (one sided mattress) that can be replaced as needed. No it's the actual mattress pillow top.</p>
<p>4. The corrected height of the mattress is actually 13.5 in not 14 in.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR VECTRAN12500LB IN WEBBING MIL T 87130.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in theirquote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a writtenamendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions submitted as follows:Q1: Is needle loom weaving acceptable for this product?A1: It is not acceptable for this product since it is a nontraditional manufacturingprocess for webbing and there is an increased potential for damage when Vectran is woventhis way.  It may be possible to produce an acceptable product with this method, but weare not comfortable with the additional risk to schedule and product integrity when thereare other manufacturers that can produce this product in the traditional way.Q2: The Vectran webbing development should reflect the following verbiage to accuratelydescribe the product for your procurement: Offray SN 2916, Vectran HT 12,500 lb/inwebbing, Coated with light R Resin per MIL-W-27265E (Condition R) 451x25 yard rolls(continuous)=11,275 yards total.A2: The problem with this description is that MIL-T-87130 is specifically for Webbingsmade from Kevlar or other Aramid fibers, and not Vectran fiber.  There is no MIL Spec forwebbings made from Vectran fibers, so we have to use existing specs and take exceptionsto describe the desired alternative, custom-made configuration.So for this procurement, the MIL-T-87130 spec should only be referenced to describe thewidth, weave type and required minimum breaking strength of the end product.The vendor wants to insert their part (style) number in the requirements.  This is notrequired, as it is a custom-made product to the above specifications.The following would also be an acceptable description:"Webbing, 1" wide, woven from Vectran HT fibers/yarns, 12,500 lb/in minimum breakingstrength. Per MIL-T-87130, Type VI, Class 11 for width, minimum breaking strength andweave pattern only.  Coated with class-R resin per MIL-W-27265E (Condition R) 451x25 yardrolls (continuous)=11,275 yards total."Q3: What is the National Stock Number (NSN) for the product?A3: This is a custom product that JSC has not ordered before. As a result NASA does notknow if there is a NSN.  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to July 26, 2010.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on July 14, 2010.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following vendor questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: What are the excitations for your applications? Using disposable cells of certain materials, i.e. acrylic, will cause interference in certain areas.</p>
<p>Answer: Excitation wavelengths shall vary; Acrylic is acceptable for our applications.</p>
<p>Question: Can you further define "Shall include Liquid Chromatography compatible flow cell accessory"? Typically a dedicated detector is used for the HPLC equipment and the fluorescence spectrophotometer is a standalone piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Answer: Market Research has shown that flow cell accessories for HPLC are available. Such an accessory will typically involve an assembly to accommodate the tubing and cell and the flow cell its self for use in HPLC. NIST understands that a dedicated HPLC detector is typical; however, it is our intention to achieve optimal flexibility with this requirement.</p>
<p><br />The due date/time for quotes remains unchanged and all responses must be received by 3pm EST, July 28, 2010.</p>

<CONTACT>Sondra Page, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882856, Email jpe7@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to American College of Surgeons, Inc, 633 N Saint Clair, Suite 2600, Chicago , IL 60611.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 813920, Professional Organizations. The period of performance for this procurement is a 12 month period of time.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to have American College Of Surgeons to develop a probabilistic link between NTDB and NEMSIS in order to enhance the quality, level and ease of accessing the national trauma data that are currently available to CDC for injury prevention research. Probabilistic linkage has been used extensively in a range of medical research involving motor vehicle crashes, maternal and child health, hospital admission rates, cancer epidemiology, evaluation of trauma systems and public vital statistics. This technique is particularly useful when unique private identifiers (for example, name, date of birth, social security number) are not available. The primary focus of this project is to determine the precision and stability that are possible when probabilistic linkage techniques are applied to two national datasets with limited unique case. <br /><br />The American College of Surgeons, Inc staff has extensive experience and expertise in handling, collecting and managing national trauma center data from hospital systems and state health departments. The American College of Surgeons has specific software that communicates with individual Trauma Centers which would not require the duplication of the infrastructure needed by any other organizations capabilities. The American College of Surgeons is the only organization with this specific infrastructure in place.</p>
<p><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the American College of Surgeons, Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to provide the services to Sondra Page via email ONLY at SJPage1@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2010-Q-12580 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN August 6th, 2010.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>Jody L. O'Kash, Email Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>NOTE TO ALL INTERESTED VENDORS: THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE ISSUED AS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR PART 12.6 PROCEDURES.&nbsp; THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS NUMBER WILL BE: FDA-SOL-10-1071337.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The U. S. Food and Drug and Administration intends to award a contract using full and open competition to provide Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) for FDA Empirica Signal Software. The NAICS code is 541511. The small business size standard is $25M. This is a commercial acquisition prepared in accordance with FAR Subparts 12 and 15.
<p>The anticipated contract type is Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The minimum order value will be met by issuance of concurrent task orders. Therefore, no funds are awarded with the issuance of an IDIQ contract. The maximum cumulative ordering ceiling value for a five year IDIQ period is anticipated to be approximately $14 million. Each individual task order issued under this contract may be a firm fixed price, time and material, labor hours or a combination thereof. The Period of Performance is five years.</p>
<p>The data used by Empirica Signal Software is the result of data extract from FDA's adverse event data repositories into a data warehouse. In this data warehouse, data management services are performed such as standardizing product names against a product dictionary and a duplicate report algorithm is used to eliminate duplicate reports. This data set is then extracted from the data warehouse for use by Empirica Signal. Empirica Signal software provides a reproducible and systematic approach to see important and useful safety signals. It is an effective tool for the early detection of previously unknown adverse reactions to both newly approved and established regulated products. Empirica Signal provides multiple graphical illustrations of data that can serve as valuable input to the overall process of product safety monitoring and review. Safety signals identified by Empirica Signal are individual product-event combinations that occur in a higher than expected proportion. These signals are carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be taken. These regulatory actions might include additional information to the product label, programs to mitigate risk for the product, or in extreme cases removal of the product from the market.</p>
<p>Please note that FDA is not seeking licenses for software, rather, it is seeking technical support for data management, software configuration, software implementation and training. Currently, FDA has multiple Centers that are utilizing the Empirica Signal Detection for their signal detection management needs. The intent is to provide support for each center. The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around July 1, 2010. The solicitation no. is FDA-SOL-10-1071337. Offerors will be given an opportunity to submit questions via e-mail ONLY after the solicitation is issued. All questions and answers will be posted to www.fedbizopps.gov. No phone calls please.</p>

<DESC><p>This updated notice hereby represents an ACTIVE Solicitation in furtherance and support of the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration's Analgesia Clinical Trails, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTION) Initiative.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Subject Solicitation Number is:&nbsp; 10-223-SOL-00263.<br /><br /><br />Please see RFP Section L.1.6, Pages 66-67 for question submittal instructions.&nbsp; All questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted to the designated&nbsp;FDA Point of Contacts no later than July 28, 2010.<br /><br /><br />Offerors are hereby reminded that you must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database in order to be eligible for award.&nbsp; You may register in CCR at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">http://www.ccr.gov</a>.&nbsp; Registration may take a few weeks.&nbsp; Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to begin the CCR registration process immediately.<br /><br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Pre-Solicitation Notification Information)<br /><br /><br />This Pre-Solicitation Notice Amendment in its entirety hereby takes precedence over all prior pre-solicitation notices regarding the FDA's Analgesia Clinical Trials Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTION) Initiative. Due to the results of numerous upper management reviews, and in an effort to maximize the probability of program success, FDA has amended its acquisition strategy for the subject requirement, as provided below.</p>
<p><br />The FDA intends to issue an RFP to develop and manage an administrative and scientific infrastructure to support non-clinical and clinical research in the areas of analgesic trial design and drug development in furtherance of the FDA's ACTION Initiative within the framework of a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The ACTION Initiative is being designed as a PPP for two key purposes. First, to initiate and foster strategic collaboration amongst a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including, but not limited to, industry, academia, professional organizations, patient advocacy groups, and other Government agencies with the well-defined goal of sharing data, best practices, and innovative thinking. Second, under the auspices of the ACTION Initiative, it is anticipated that these stakeholders will leverage their resources (e.g. data, scientific expertise, infrastructure, and financial resources) to foster dialog and develop specific projects that will add to the body of information so that analgesic drug development can be moved forward in an expedited and efficient manner.</p>
<p><br />The ACTION PPP overarching objectives have been defined, as follows: (1) Identify scientific gaps in the design, implementation, and interpretation of clinical trials of drug products intended for the treatment of acute and/or chronic pain; (2) Develop scientific projects that will bridge the identified gaps and facilitate the development of novel, safe, and effective analgesic drug products; and, (3) Disseminate project findings to the analgesic community at large.</p>
<p><br />More specifically, in follow-up to this Presolicitation Notice and in furtherance and support of the ACTION Initiative, FDA intends to solicit proposals to aid in the development and execution of the following 6 inter-related activities as a single, comprehensive effort:</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS [Items 1-3]:</p>
<p>(1) Develop a Scientific Advisory Board to develop, manage, and implement a series of projects under the ACTION PPP [Responsibilities will include soliciting, reviewing, evaluating, prioritizing, and selecting projects for review and approval by the Executive Committee of the ACTION PPP.];</p>
<p>(2) Develop a strategic plan for the establishment of an administrative and scientific infrastructure to support a series of scientific projects under the ACTION PPP;</p>
<p>(3) Coordinate a scientific workshop with key experts in the field of analgesia and pain management, as well as all potential partners of the ACTION PPP, including stakeholders from industry, professional organizations, patient advocacy groups, and other Government agencies;</p>
<p>SCIENTIFIC STUDIES [Items 4-6]:</p>
<p>(4) Assess FDA's clinical trial databases and develop novel and alternative means of analyzing various pain scores in a manner that effectively considers variables, such as bias and inter-individual variance, as guided by the FDA and the ACTION PPP;</p>
<p>(5) Establish and assess both group and individual analgesic clinical trials databases for relationships between assay sensitivity and metrics, including, but not limited to, specific research designs and methodological features so as to guide the future design of analgesic clinical trials, as guided by the FDA and the ACTION PPP; and</p>
<p>(6) Develop methodologies for the execution and transformation of pooled trial data from relevant analgesic trials for treatment of acute and chronic pain.</p>
<p><br />FDA anticipates competing the requirement on a 100% "Full and Open" basis, utilizing the procurement methods set forth at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and making a single award to the responsive offeror whose proposal provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the prospective solicitation. Successful execution of the aforementioned activities will involve enormous challenges in terms of the broad array of skills, abilities, knowledge, and resources required to complete all activities in a timely, efficient, and effective manner.</p>
<p>Therefore, because it is unlikely that any one entity will possess all of the expertise and resources necessary to accomplish all work required under this requirement, ALL INTERESTED ENTITIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO BEGIN FORMING SUB-CONTRACTING AND/OR TEAMING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO SUBMIT THORUGH AND COMPETITIVE RESPONSES TO THE PROSPECTIVE ACTION INITIATIVE SOLICITATION.</p>
<p><br />The prospective contract award type and respective period of performance is anticipated to be Firm-Fixed-Price and/or Labor Hour and approximately 12 months from date of award, respectively. The anticipated performance location is the responsive offeror's preferred location; however, the awardee will be required to travel to the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area, including the state of Maryland.</p>
<p><br />The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 813920 - Professional Organizations. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in promoting the professional interests of their members and the profession as a whole. These establishments may conduct research; develop statistics; sponsor quality and certification standards; lobby public officials; or publish newsletters, books, or periodicals, for distribution to their members.</p>
<p><br />This announcement is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). The FDA anticipates release of the prospective RFP on or around July 14, 2010, to be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site. The anticipated proposal due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around August 16, 2010, and September 15, 2010, respectively.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties must respond to the prospective RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. Individual notifications will NOT be sent to potential offerors regarding the issuance of the solicitation, nor any of its amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor FBO for release of this acquisition and any associated amendments.</p>
<p>**NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED AT THIS TIME**</p>
<p>Offerors will be provided an opportunity to submit questions via e-mail after the solicitation is released. All respective answers will be posted to www.FBO.gov via solicitation amendment.</p>

<DESC><p>The sources sought notice previously posted for this requirement has been modified.&nbsp; Please see text in italics below.&nbsp; Potential offerors who previously responded do not need to respond again.<br /><br />The United States Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Acquisition Management Division is requesting information from interested vendors who can provide&nbsp;a <em>fully immersive telepresence solution</em> including&nbsp;equipment, <em>managed</em> services, installation and maintenance for up to ten (10) locations across the US. Potential period of performance is 12 months base period with four one-year option periods. MSHA is conducting market research to gain an understanding of the capabilities and qualifications that exist in the marketplace as well as to finalize an acquisition strategy and potentially release an RFP. It is anticipated that any RFP released would be a small business set aside.</p>
<p>MSHA intends to improve consistency in enforcement activities and enhance the knowledge and skills of mine inspectors through the use of increased contemporary telecommunications technologies. Improved communication technology also will facilitate the effective engagement of MSHA's highly-decentralized field personnel in understanding and responding to key outcomes and initiatives of the Secretary and MSHA and reduce the variability sometimes associated with the delivery of live training sessions. The Telepresence solution will provide more consistent, effective, and cost efficient training to MSHA inspectors. Telepresence will eliminate variability associated with the delivery of multiple training sessions on the same topic and foster consistency in enforcement activities, improving MSHA's ability to prevent death, injury, and illness from mining. Use of the Telepresence solution also will address the recent OIG audit finding of inspector retraining deficiencies.</p>
<p><em>Potential vendors must be able to provide the software operating system, hardware platform, infrastructure upgrades, optimal bandwidth, site survey, room preparation, classroom setup (1-25 participants), training, end user documentation, technical maintenance and support, and security consistent with DOL requirements.&nbsp; Vendors must be able to provide a dedicated network circuit for the proposed solution. The proposed solution should be able to provide recording/streaming functionality that is a standaolne or with integrated device(s), as well as accessing/bridigin to other Government Agencies, universities, and private industry on encrypted calls via a cloud based service. The proposed solution should be designed for ease of use, including touch screen capabilities, and 24/7 concierge services</em></p>
<p>Locations for the 10 Telepresence endpoints are:</p>
<p>1. Beaver, WV<br />2. Pikeville, KY<br />3. Barbourville, KY<br />4. Morgantown, WV<br />5. Denver, CO<br />6. Price, UT<br />7. Birmingham, AL<br />8. Arlington, VA<br />9. Mount Pleasant, PA<br />10. Pittsburgh, PA<br /><br />This is not a request for proposals at this time. Potential vendors must register for consideration by COB July 20, 2010 and send a capability statement electronically to the Contracting Officer at cooper.darrell@dol.gov. Potential vendors who have Telepresence products or services on established GWAC contracts are encouraged to provide contract numbers and relevant information.</p>
<p>No facsimile transmissions will be accepted or considered.</p>

Quotes are due on July 23, 2010, by 4:30 p.m., Mountain Time
Project Title:  Canyon Waste Water Treatment Plant Controls Upgrade, Yellowstone National Park
Description of Changes:
Section 1 of this amendment provides responses to comments received on the Statement of Work (SOW) in the existing combined synopsis/solicitation as follows:
Section 1:
1)   Comment:  Please confirm that the National Park Service (NPS) will provide lodging for the service people that will be making the panel changes in November.  What would be the maximum number of people (or rooms) and the maximum number of days that the NPS would provide.
       Response:  The NPS shall provide two kitchenette apartments for the duration of the initial installation process from November 1 through November 25, 2010.  Contractor is responsible for providing food and other essentials.  Contractor will be responsible for accommodations during final start up in June.   
2)   Comment:  Please verify that a touch screen is required.  If it is required, please specify a model number and specify where it needs to be located. If it is in the filter area by the existing control panel, can it be located in the existing control panel?
       Response:  The touch screen and cabinet will be provided by contractor. The touch screen shall be mounted on wall located in plant office in the contractor supplied cabinet.  The touch screen shall be color, a minimum of 16 inches and brand name or equal to an Automation Direct Model EA7-T12CT08517B075. 
3)   Comment:  Please confirm that the contractors are or are not installing and configuring and initializing the new ABB controllers.
       Response:  The contractor will install, configure and initialize the new ABB controllers. These ABB controllers have already been purchased by the NPS.
4)   Comment:  Please confirm that the delivery must be by November 1st, the PLC installed and checked out by Thanksgiving, the new PLC program operational by the time the Park is opened in the Spring and that the final start up of the aerators will be after June 1st, 2011, and that all of those visits must be included in the price. Or something to that effect whatever it might be.
       Response:  The original solicitation stated a delivery date of October 1, 2010, and should be corrected to reflect a delivery date of November 25, 2010.  Installation shall begin on November 1 and the PLC shall be completely installed and operational no later than November 25, 2010.  The final startup with aerators will be in the spring after June 1, 2011.  All visits shall be included in the quoted price.
All Inputs and Outputs shown on as built will be provided for on new PLC.   
The NPS will shut the plant down so the work can be accomplished in a timely manner with a minimum of interruptions. The NPS will have plant operational at the contractors request so system performance can be evaluated.
5)   Comment:  Who is to supply the bank of batteries (used for backup)?  We now understand that the UPS is already purchased. It needs to be installed as part of this scope of work. Who is to supply the touch screen interface? We now understand that you wish to have a PLC with connections for a Touch Screen that may be added in the future.
       Response:  The NPS shall supply an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) which shall be installed by contractor.   
The touch screen and cabinet shall be provided by contractor. The touch screen shall be mounted on the wall located in plant office in the contractor supplied cabinet.  6)   Comment:  If the vendor is to provide the cabinet for the NPS supplied PC, then does this cabinet need room to mount the HOA switches? Also, we will need the dimensions/type of the PC being provided. 
       Response:  The cabinet will house the contractor supplied touch screen.  HOA switches can be mounted on existing cabinet in filter area.  This is the same cabinet in which the PLC will be housed. 
7)   Comment:  Is the vendor responsible for specifying and supplying the Canary Systems Data Logger system or is NPS providing that?
      Response:  The Park Service will be providing the Canary Systems data logging software.  The contractor will install software on plants existing desktop and provide connect ability to PLC for archiving and logging of  plants operational parameters. Examples of parameters are daily plant flow influent and effluent, backwash cycles, and turbidity.  
The NPS will provide IP address for network connection.
8)   Comment:  After further consideration of the RFQ, the picture has become a bit clearer yet regarding the "PLC" controller.  Item 2 of the RFQ says "Phoenix Contact's WINPLC with Think and Do runtime software will be used as the controls programming application.  The keyword here is "runtime".  The Automation Direct website has a module (H2-WPLC3-EN) that is described as "WINPLC WITH THINK & DO RUNTIME 8MB RAM 8MB ROM".  So it appears that this is the actual device slated for running the actual control program.  Is this correct?
       Response:  The National Park Service has specified a DL205 system with a Win PLC CPU running Windows CE. This system will allow an HMI (touch screen) to connect to the PLC using the RS 232 port and the 10 base t port. This will allow connection to a 5 port Ethernet switch (vendor supplied) which will allow the HMI to communicate back to the Win PLC.  Connection to the office PC will be on the NPS network using the NPS supplied IP address.  Contractor supplied HMI shall be installed in a contractor supplied cabinet in the office. The contractor shall install and integrate Canary software (NPS supplied) and data logging in our PC in the office. The new PLC shall be installed in the same location as the old Siemens PLC. This DL205 System should handle all the plant needs.  Should the DL205 fall short of our needs the NPS may exercise Option Line Item 0002 found in this amendment for the purchase of an upgrade to a 405 EBC system and a HMI running Windows CE platform.  System can work using the DL205 plus expansion modules, if needed (See Option Line Item 0002 below  Pricing for Optional 405 EBC Upgrade).
  9)   Comment:  Reference solicitation - Statement of Work, Lines 8 and 9: It was discussed during the site visit that the PLC I/O could be reinstalled in the existing enclosure rather than locating in the lab office invalidating the need for adding additional terminations and re-routing wire.  Is this considered acceptable?
         Response:  PLC I/0 can be reinstalled in existing cabinet.  The new contractor supplied touch screen will be mounted in plant office.  
10)  Comment:  Reference solicitation  Statement of Work, Line 3: It appears that the vendor does not provide any deliverables, however is there a requirement for the vendor to do integration?
        Response:  The NPS will be providing the Canary Systems data logging software.  The contractor will install software on plants existing desktop and provide connect ability to PLC for archiving and logging of plants operational parameters. Examples of parameters are daily plant flow influent and effluent, backwash cycles, and turbidity.  The contractor will provide deliverables such as the touch screen and PLC.  
11)  Comment:   Reference solicitation - Statement of Work, Line 11: Need more information regarding the statement: Program for data acquisition must feature an operational maintenance log, daily plant work log, lab worksheet, and process chemical feed recording.  
        Response:  Reference solicitation - Statement of Work, Line 11:  SOW Line 11 shall be omitted from original solicitation.
12)  Comment:  After further consideration of the RFQ, the picture has become a bit clearer yet regarding the PLC controller.  Item 2 of the RFQ (Statement of Work) says Phoenix Contact's WINPLC with Think and Do runtime software will be used as the controls programming application.  The keyword here is runtime.  The Automation Direct website has a module (H2-WPLC3-EN) that is described as WINPLC WITH THINK & DO RUNTIME 8MB RAM 8MB ROM.  So it appears that this is the actual device slated for running the actual control program.  Is this correct?  
        Response:  That is correct.  This device should work for the required tasks.

Section 2: 
Section 2 of this amendment provides for changes to the Statement of Work (SOW) as described in the existing combined synopsis/solicitation as follows:
13)  SOW Line 5 which reads:  Contractor shall interface the PLC to an industrial computer (provided by the National Park Service) and to a touch screen interface, which includes the installation of new Uninterrupted Power Supply [Toshiba 1600EP Series UPS (provided by the National Park Service)] for filtering control power.  The system must have battery backup ability to insure smooth transition of power from generator to public power and the reverse.    Is changed to read:  Contractor will install Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) provided by The National Park Service.
14)  SOW Line 10 which reads:  Contractor will install a new cabinet to house the touch screen and industrial computer. 
Is changed to read: Contractor will install new cabinet to house touch screen in plant office.  This will be a wall mounted application.
15)  SOW Line 11 which reads:  The DL 205 CPU will be connected to a desktop PC via an Ethernet based controller (EBC).  This desktop PC will be used for data acquisition. Program for data acquisition must feature an operational maintenance log, daily plant work log, lab worksheet, and process chemical feed recording. 
Line 11 is omitted from original solicitation.
16)  SOW Line 12 which reads:  All of the plant process parameters will be displayed graphically on computer screens. The operator will access the screens and change parameters with standard point and click mouse technology. 
Is changed read:  Plant Process parameters will be displayed graphically on Touch Screen located in plant office.  Touch screen will be used to control plant functions such as flow, aerator run times and backwash processes.
17)  SOW Line 14 which reads:  All of the automatic equipment will have capability for complete manual operation independent of the controller. Each piece of automatic equipment will have HOA (hand, off, auto) switch.  
Addition to Line 14:  HOA switches will allow ABB Controllers to run plant operations independent of PLC. 
18)  SOW Line 16 which reads:  Desktop PC shall be capable to provide for manual operation should system PLC fail.  Operators need the option to override PLC with desktop and run things in a manual mode.  
Line 16 is omitted from original solicitation.


Delivery and Installation:
Delivery and installation shall begin on November 1, 2010, and the PLC shall be completely installed and operational no later than November 25, 2010.  The final startup with aerators will be in the spring after June 1, 2010.  All visits shall be included in the quoted price.

Section 3:
Section 3 of this amendment adds an optional line item for a 405 EBC upgrade along with attached option clauses to be exercised by the NPS if needed:

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Mission Monrovia. The U.S. Mission Monrovia requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about May 20, 2010. No paper copies will be mailed. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change. Offerors will be notified. A site visit is tentatively scheduled approximately twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens, at the U.S. Mission Monrovia. A firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Monrovia. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit. Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Matthew J. Colantonio at ColantonioMJ@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: </strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. NO award will be made as a result of this request. This request for information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has identified the need to improve the overall process for the development of requirements for software systems supporting the processing of patent and trademark applications. The USPTO is seeking customized training for its employees, including those within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) as well as those employees within other business units of the USPTO. The USPTO has determined that its approach to requirements shall be based on the principles outlined in the book Software Requirements, 2nd ed., by Karl Wiegers (hereinafter referred to as the "Wiegers" approach or methodology). The USPTO has already trained some employees on the Wiegers approach.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> The USPTO has determined that additional training is needed for its employees involved in the development of software systems. Based on its past experience with requirements training, the USPTO has determined that providing a generic, "out-of-the-box" course to its employees is not effective. Instead, the USPTO has determined that the following customized approach would meet the training needs of its employees. In phase 1, a company providing the training will assess the training needs of the employees in the group to be trained as well as the current approach to requirements in the USPTO organizations from which these employees come. The contractor will provide a customized training workshop plan for the group to be trained. In phase 2, the contractor will provide training workshops that use specific USPTO projects as the basis for exercises in the workshops. In phase 3, the contractor will provide assistance to the workshop attendees in applying the skills from the workshop in real-world situations. In other words, the contractor will provide personnel who will act as a coach/mentor to the workshop attendees in order to assure that the workshop attendees have fully understood the training course and can apply the training. All phase 2 customized training workshops would be held at the USPTO's Alexandria, VA campus. Given the USPTO's choice of a particular approach to requirements and its specified format for the training, a contractor would need specialized skills in order to provide the customized training and any proposed contractor employee would be expected to have the skills to perform all phases of the requirements training to maintain continuity in working with the students. Any contractor would need to have staff licensed to teach the Wiegers methodology in its training courses and would need to have demonstrated experience in diagnosing the needs of the students and tailoring course materials to those needs. Second, any contractor would need to have staff with industry and/or government experience in developing software requirements using the Wiegers methodology, industry and/or government experience in teaching the Wiegers methodology, and the ability to add specific skills appropriate to each group's requirements. This combination of practical development experience and teaching experience is necessary in order for any contractor to effectively act as a coach/mentor to USPTO employees during phase 3 of the training to ensure the students can effectively implement the methodology in the student's project environment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain comments, questions, and information regarding the implementation of the USPTO's requirements engineering training program. The USPTO is particularly interested in identifying companies capable of providing the services outlined above. From such a contractor, the USPTO is interested in an explanation of: (1) the contractor's past experience in providing customized training as outlined above to government and/or corporations; (2) the identification of contractor resources, including qualifications of proposed personnel and licenses to teach the Wiegers methodology; and (3) a brief explanation of the relevant work/teaching experience of the contractor and its qualified employee(s), (4) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g.,small business, 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code(s); (5) contract vehicles and (6) any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the USPTO's acquisition requirements. This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit all questions, comments, and information to satisfy the statement of OBJECTIVES.</p>
<p>All information should be submitted as a pdf file attached to an email addressed to the following email address: Requirements.Training.Program@uspto.gov. All submissions are limited to fifteen (15) pages. The contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. The government will review RFI submissions as they are received. The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.<br /><br />THE RESPONSE DATE FOR THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO AUGUST 2, 2010.</p>

<DESC>IWCS<BR><BR>This posting addresses a number of questions that have been submitted in response to the posting of the draft Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>1. It is anticipated that the request for proposal for Irregular Warfare Consolidated Support will be released 23 July 2010.  Contract award of this requirement is projected for 16 September 2010.<BR><BR>2. The majority of work supporting this effort will be CONUS at NGIC and up to two (2) analysts in theater [OEF] for 24 hours/7 days a week, as required (reference draft PWS paragraph 3.1, Task 1).<BR><BR>3. The individuals that will be deploying will be required to process through the CONUS Replacement Center (https://www.benning.army.mil/crc/) as part of their preparation and readiness. <BR><BR>4. It is estimated that deployment to support this effort would begin in January or February 2011.<BR><BR>5. As a Performance Work Statement, the number of personnel proposed for each task order shall be based on the contractor's overall solution to achieve the government's required outcome.  However, the IDIQ contract type allows the Government to issue a task order for a requirement at the time it becomes known -- based on the availability of funds. <BR><BR>6. This will be a single award. <BR><BR>7. This is a total small business set-aside.  The Government's Independent Cost Estimate and Not to Exceed (NTE) value will not be disclosed.  The minimum and maximum values for the Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract are established in clause 52.216-19 'Order Limitations' in Section I of the solicitation.<BR><BR>8. The Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-14 -- Limitations on Subcontracting will apply to this contract.  [Since this will be a contract for services, the following applies:  (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.]<BR><BR>9. There will not be an industry day for this effort.<BR><BR>10. The evaluation criteria will be addressed in the request for proposal.

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components. <br />
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

<DESC>The Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Mission (CLARREO) is aclimate-focused mission.  The foundation for CLARREO is its ability to produce accurateclimate records through the use of exacting on-board traceability of the instrumentaccuracy to international measurement standards.  Current satellite-based sensors are not designed to meet the accuracy requirementsnecessary for climate measurements.  Many sensors used for climate measurements weredesigned to meet operational weather needs and were not specifically designed to meet thedemanding calibration accuracies required for climate measurement.  The CLARREO missionis intended to meet climate needs through careful consideration of the instrument design,calibration traceability at all stages of development, calibration and verificationtraceability on-orbit, and spectral, spatial, and temporal sampling focused specificallyon the creation of accurate, long-term climate data records. The following web site willprovide additional background information on CLARREO: http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/.CLARREOs instrument suite is planned to include one or more spectrometers that willconduct measurements in the infrared spectrum.	Infrared measurement requirements areprovided in Section 4.0 for reference.	Due to CLARREOs stringent requirements onmeasurement accuracy, calibration, and traceability, NASA is forming an IntegratedProduct Team (IPT) to ensure that the requisite expertise and capabilities fromGovernment, industry and academia are available to contribute to the systems engineering,design, analysis, development and characterization of the instrument systems andcomponents used by CLARREO to conduct the infrared measurements.Awarded contracts will provide support for a CLARREO Integrated Product Team (IPT) toprovide instrument systems expertise and capabilities for conducting measurements in theinfrared spectrum.

Suite 100, Baltimore, MD 21244 US
<DESC>Section 1102 of the Affordable Care Act establishes the temporary Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP). ERRP is designed to encourage the retention of employer-sponsored health benefits coverage and to lower the costs of such benefits to early retirees and their eligible spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents.  Generally, plan sponsors may receive an amount equal to 80 percent of allowable health care costs for these individuals between a cost threshold and cost limit.  In order to qualify for reinsurance payments, a plan sponsor must apply to the program, be approved, and submit certain data related to health care costs for qualifying individuals.  

The Contact Center will establish a single point of contact for plan sponsors participating in the ERRP to submit telephonic and written inquiries and request other forms of technical support.  The Contact Center shall remotely access systems that will enable the documentation of telephone conversations, the tracking of responses to Email inquiries, the review of HHS-approved scripted responses for certain incoming inquiries, and the submission of technical support tickets whenever advanced technical support is required.  

Period of Performance: 12 month base with three 12 month option periods


This is a non-competitive contract action under the authority of FAR 6.302-2.  In accordance with FAR 6.305, the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be made publicly available at the GPE.

<DESC>The Purpose of this requirement is to purchase Dell 2160AS PowerEdge Server, Dell 4220 42U Storage Rack and additional equipment per the attachment. Dell brand name equipment is being requested as an approved organization Enterprise Architecture solution currently being utilized to house and support IHS server equipment. The requested Dell brand equipment allows for continuity and compatibility with existing equipment (servers, rails, etc) in regards to the management and support of IHS critical servers. The purchase of other brands at this point would result in a poor fit of the Dell servers into a non-standard rack, the ability to manage each rack of equipment with non-standard KVM switches and an increased learning curves, duplicate work efforts and increased administrative costs.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-09-0003.  Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

Fire Doors and Install, Bldg. 27
Project # 138-10-29

1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20,  Boise VA Medical Center

2.	Description of Action:  To procure fire doors as part of the remodel in building 27

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The 2237 5409-0570 is for the purchase and install of 2 fire doors in building 27. The doors will have a continuous hinge and will fit into the existing frame. The doors will be the industry standard and adhere to present day code for fire and safety. The vendor will also install and re-use existing door pieces as instructed.

4.	Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1  
	( x )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  This vendor is a small business concern with knowledge of local historical guidelines and has installed other fire doors in the Boise VA on different occasions. Due to the age of the building and the cost effectiveness to use the existing frame work and locking mechanisms  it is in the best interest of the government to use a local source.

6.	Actions to Promote Competition: N/A 

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 6251.00  Contracting Officer must establish price reasonableness for each and every procurement action.  They will do so in this block.   If we cannot establish that we are getting fair value we may be back to you in order to determine another route for the acquisition.   

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  I went into GSA Advantage and could not find this type of item on FSS Schedule.  

9.	Other Considerations:  Statement of why other competition options are not available.
a.	Boston Scientific is the product being used by our clinicians at this facility and should be the only product used to maintain consistency.
10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: List compiled by CO prior to posting final J&A on Fed Biz Ops

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: How can we open competition to more than a single source

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Justification and Approval Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Statutory Authority - </strong>The statutory authority for this requirement is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as Implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Applicability of Authority - </strong>Ebsco<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"> Information Services has been the only company that can provide the breadth of titles needed, the infrastructure and indexing services to access online titles and products, and the need for sophisticated claims and reports services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other companies may provide periodical subscriptions, online products, and/or individual subscriptions but after evaluating market capabilities no other company can provide all of these items and incidental services and allow access to them under one umbrella.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Efforts to Obtain Competition - </strong>A Sources Sought Synopsis was posted 2 March 2010 stating that Ebsco was the only known source that could provide the entire list of products required and any interested vendor that felt they could meet the requirement should respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the synopsis stated the governments intend to negotiate as a sole source with Ebsco if no responses were received or no capable vendor could be found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Sources Sought Synopsis produced no responses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the Contract Specialist completed a survey of 8 Universities that resembled the Air Force Academy requirement based on similar accreditations within Colorado.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contract Specialist found that each University used Ebsco.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although several Universities used additional sources for similar products all still required Ebsco to meet part of their library product and incidental services requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No other company could be found that could meet the entire requirement of the McDermott Library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Market Research - </strong>As part of Market Research the McDermott Library technical expert reviewed other competitors in the periodical subscription market and found none that could provide all the titles, online databases, and services needed by the library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other competitors provide online products but do not provide periodical subscription service. Furthermore, all Higher Learning Commission and Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business accredited colleges in Colorado were contacted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All Universities contacted stated that they use Ebsco services and although there are other sources that provide various related services, they still require EBSCO to meet their requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Other Facts</strong> - <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Having all periodicals, subscriptions, memberships and online databases provided by one vendor is a mandatory requirement for the library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have limited human resources available and the volume of periodicals and online products required and the administrative effort to track orders and process payments coming from numerous publishers could not be supported by the McDermott Library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Interested Sources</strong></p>
<p>As evidenced above we could find no other company capable of meeting the requirement. Though extensive market research was conducted and a Request for Information was issued, there were no companies found to support all periodical and online products required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Steps to Foster Competition - </strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">In future acquisitions we will seek additional sources by reevaluating markets capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, current market conditions don't indicate there will be any other companies capable of providing all the periodicals and online products in the near future. </span></p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Center for Acquisition Innovation (CAI) Frederick, Frederick, MD.

2.  Nature/Description of Action.

This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Pathfinder Works LLC, for the procurement of services for:  1) Acquisition Support Services.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Center for Acquisition Innovation (CAI) Frederick Maryland needs Acquisition Support Services.  The support services will involve all activities in the acquisition process from Pre-Award to Post Award.  The estimated value of this requirement is $374,000.00 for a base period of performance of six months and $374,000.00 for an optional period of performance of six months.  The total value of this effort is estimated to be $748,800.00

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  The applicable statute is Public Law 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

Pathfinder Works LLC has successfully performed the functions of Acquisition Support Services for Government agencies in the past.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.

A notice of intent to sole source will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the Federal Register Vol. 74, No. 234 (Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Acquisition Regulation Supporting Veteran-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses) Final Rule #5.  Future competition for award will be considered on a case-by-case basis for award.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on a comparison of other contract's for same or similar services, the contractors public price list, GSA Schedule Pricing and Pathfinder Works LLC's quote.

8.  Description of Market Survey.

Market research was conducted using VetBiz.gov.  We determined that Pathfinder Works LLC is a responsible source with respect to this contracting opportunity.  They are registered and certified in VetBiz.gov as a SDVOSB with the NAICS code for this requirement which in accordance with Public Law 109-461 Section 502(c) meets the requirements of this statute to sole source to a SDVOSB.

9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

PL109-461 Section 502(c) states:

SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS FOR CONTRACTS ABOVE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if ---

(1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
(2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and
(3)	In the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

This procurement meets all of these conditions.

10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

Pathfinder Works LLC
1775 Wiehle Avenue Suite 102
Reston, VA. 20190

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

Other Than Full and Open Competition

VA Northern California Health Care System
3230 Peacekeeper Way, Bldg 209
McClellan CA 95652


Medical Commodities - Palo Alto VAPAHCS (640)

1.   CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Contracting Activity-VISN 21.

2.   DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:   Purchase Request 640-10-3-021-3661, for an Active Care 
C. E. CT Device and Accessories Rental.

3.   DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:   Request is for an Active Care 
C. E. CT Device and Accessories Rental for the VA Palo Alto Facility.  The estimated value of this maintenance contract being requested is $50,000.00

4.   AUTHORITY CITED:  FAR 13.106(b) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."
  
5.   REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:   Other manufacturers and distributors are not able to provide the combination of features that meets the needs of the customer.  Medical Compression Systems is the only provider that makes the only portable compression device that has been proven to be an effective blood thinner injection for preventing blood clot formations.

6.   EFFORTS MADE FOR SOLICITING FROM OTHER VENDORS:  An internet search, telephone interviews, and research on previous procurements were made.  Another vendor could not be located that could supply all items under contract.  In the future other systems will be looked at soliciting as a system.  

7.   FAIR AND REASONABLE COST DETERMINATION:   A Price Negotiation Memorandum (PNM) will detail how the Government has determined that the anticipated costs will be fair and reasonable.

8.   MARKET RESEARCH:   Market research could not indicate any vendor that could supply the features that the customer was looking for.  In the future other systems will be looked at soliciting as a system.  

9.    SUPPORTING FACTS:  The system is unique in two main attributes.  The first is the S.F.T. technology, S.F.T. stands for Synchronized Flow Technology, the system actually monitors the venous phasic flow and triggers the compression so that it is in sync with the venous phasic flow, thus creating a very high Pulsatile flow and reaching peak venous velocity at the common femoral vein almost twice as high as that of any other device.  The second is the miniaturization and portability of the system which allow it to actually deliver the therapy to the patient in the acute care and post acute settings with very high compliance 
10.  LISTING OF SOURCES:  There are currently no other sources who have expressed interest in this acquisition.
11.  STATEMENT OF ACTIONS:  As new technology becomes available, review of the current system will be done to see if it can be replaced.  This will be done in sufficient time to facilitate full and open competition. 

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
