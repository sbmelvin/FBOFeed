<CONTACT>Kimberly Luke Contract Specialist 7037871339     kimberly.luke@mms.gov;
<DESC>The US Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to award a sole source purchase order as a sponsoring Federal Agency to the Colorado School of Mines, Center for Welding, Joining and Coatings (CSM) for the following tasks in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1:  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The purpose of the study is to develop wet welding electrodes meeting Class A welds requirements according to AWS 3.6 specifications at multiple water depths up to 100 meters for both normal and high strength grade (up to 80 ksi yield strength) steels used for construction and repair of offshore oil and gas structures. Since flat and curved, horizontal and vertical positions are common to offshore facility structural fabrication and repair, electrodes should be analyzed under each of these conditions.   Particular attention must be given to metallurgical evaluation (e.g., slag and molten metal flow characterization) of multipass welding to demonstrate suitability for offshore underwater applications.  Based on these results, the welding procedures for these steels can be prepared for subsequent technology transfer.  This task is heavily based on the results developed earlier in this program and represents a culmination of work from Phases I and II. The MMS will provide sponsorship funding in the amount of $63,471 for an eighteen month period of performance.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541690 "Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services." This notice is not a formal solicitation.  This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received by the POC listed below by close of business January 20, 2006, will be considered by the government.  POC: Kimberly Luke, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2100, Herndon, VA 20170.  Questions must be emailed to Kimberly.Luke@mms.gov or faxed to Kimberly Luke at 703-787-1041.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>Description:  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate/award on a competitive basis a requirement for a contractor to execute a hydrology study.  The purpose of the study is to produce a Geographic Information System (GIS) to be used for a hydrologic model representative of the numerous subbasins and routing reaches for the entire drainage area above the Central Arizona Project (CAP) Dikes known as Dike 1 and Dike 2 in northern metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona and Scottsdale, Arizona.  This work should be similar in nature and complexity to the previous study for the areas above Dike 3 and Dike 4 which were produced as part of the Scottsdale Master Drainage Study.   Part of the drainage basins above Dike 1 and Dike 2 are also included in the Scottsdale Master Drainage Study HEC-1 model. The hydrologic model software required shall be the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's HEC-1.  The HEC-1 model developed for Dike 1 and Dike 2 should be completely compatible with the Scottsdale Master Drainage Study HEC-1 input files. It is anticipated that the final HEC-1 model for Dike 1 and Dike 2 will contain several hundred subbasins to be compatible with the Scottsdale Master Drainage Study.  The GIS shall contain all of the geographic, geologic, meteorological, and hydrologic layers needed to create the HEC-1 model.  The HEC-1 model shall incorporate all applicable data and procedures currently used by Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC) for storm drainage and flood control projects in Maricopa County using FCDMC's Drainage Design Management System (DDMS).  Contractors will have had to successfully complete multiple subbasin analysis for large areas and drainage networks in urbanized areas of northern Phoenix and Scottsdale metropolitan areas in Arizona.   Contractors will also need to have completed drainage studies that have been submitted to and accepted by the cities of Phoenix or Scottsdale or FCDMC (Flood Control District of Maricopa County).  Documented experience with HEC-1, GIS, FCDMC, and DDMS will be required.  The estimated duration of the overall study is 125 work days. Any firm that believes it can execute the pending study is encouraged to obtain a copy of the Request for Quotation from the Contracting Officer.  All contractors requesting a copy within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be forwarded a copy of the Request for Quotation.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning.  Responses should include the firm's business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard: $6 Million for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541690.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Moya, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 202-220-5407, Fax 202-220-5711, Email elizabeth.moya@csosa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is issued to notify Faith Based Institutions in the District of Columbia that Court  Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia requires Faith Based Coordination Services for Offender Reintegration on a firm-fixed price, contractual basis.  The planned contract will consist of a one year base and 4 one year options.  CSOSA may award multiple contracts under the solicitation to be issued for this requirement, which will ONLY be electronically issued on the FedBizzOpps website (www.fbo.gov), along any amendments thereto.  A Faith Based Institution shall be a house of worship such as a mosque, temple, or church, or an entity whose membership is composed primarily of clergy and which is affiliated with one or more houses of worship.  Such house of worship shall currently exist within the District of Columbia geographical boundaries.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.  CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia.  Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities.  In January 2002, CSOSA announced the inception of a broad-based support system that involves community supervision and the faith community in a concerted effort to: reduce recidivism rates among offenders under CSOSA supervision; improve public safety in the District by facilitating successful re-entry of offenders into the community; develop partnership or mentorship programs with stakeholders in an effort to meet mutual goals; and build capacity of Faith Based Institutions to increase the likelihood of future successful collaborative relationships.  Therefore, CSOSA intends to contract for cluster coordinative leadership in specific geographic areas within the District of Columbia.  A cluster is a group of Faith-Based Institutions, located in a designated geographical area, that has formed a partnership and has agreed to participate jointly in providing Faith-Based Reintegration Services.  Cluster coordinative leadership shall include, but is not limited to, assisting the Government and other participating Faith Based Institutions in identifying, expanding and applying the various ministries and outreach program strategies, building capacity for program management and analysis, furthering the development of a case management system to track offenders referred to the program, and implementing a volunteer management program to accurately track availability of mentors and other volunteers that are responsive to the needs of the reentering offenders and their families.  The lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall provide all necessary personnel, supervision, equipment, materials and supplies to facilitate and coordinate Faith Based Reintegration Service delivery for offenders.  The Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall also perform varied data collection and reporting duties on behalf of all participating Faith Based Institutions in a cluster.  It shall be expressly agreed and understood that the planned contract(s) is a nonpersonal services contract(s), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) are rendered in its capacity as an independent contractor.  The successful Faith Based Institution (contractor) will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria being equal in importance to price / cost.  The proposed contract(s) is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813110 with a small business size standard of $6.5 MIL.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Such registration may be accomplished at www.ccr.gov.  A paper copy of this solicitation will not be available to requestors and, therefore, the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  It is incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the solicitation via this website (once it is issued) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt may render a proposal ineligible for award.  The solicitation issue date will around 23 January 2006.  Proposal submittal requirements will be identified in SECTION L of the solicitation and timely proposals (offers) will be evaluated in accordance with SECTION M.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate selection approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost.

<DESC>The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is issuing a synopsis for a commercial item procurement that will be competed under FAR Part 12.  This is a full and open competition.  This procurement is mission critical, and it is CBP’s goal to solicit and make award to as many qualified vendors as possible to achieve mission success.  A best value determination will be made based on past performance, technical, and price.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award contract with a base year and four one-year option periods is anticipated for this acquisition.  Multiple awards will be made for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) under the contract, therefore, vendors may propose on one or more CLINs in the Request for Proposals.  HOWEVER, THIS NOTICE IS NOT BEING POSTED AS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).  THIS NOTICE IS ONLY A SYNOPSIS FOR A FUTURE CBP REQUIREMENT.  The RFP for this procurement will be released on or about January 19, 2006.  The Government will entertain questions from vendors for a short period of time after the RFP is released.  This Q&A period will be posted in the RFP.  The total solicitation time (which includes the Q&A period, the Government’s Responses to Vendor Questions, and the submission of proposals from vendors) for this requirement will last approximately 12 calendar days.  Potential offerors should ensure that they are registered in CCR updating all information that is not current.  

THE REQUIREMENT:  CBP currently maintains two canine facilities to assist it in achieving mission success.  These facilities are:  1) The Canine Enforcement Training Center (CETC) in Front Royal, Virginia, and 2) The National Canine Facility (NCF) in El Paso, Texas.  This synopsis is being posted to notify all qualified vendors under the aforementioned NAICS code of the Bureau’s requirement for untrained canines.  Canines are needed for various reasons, ranging from CBP officer training classes to canine replacement due to injury, disease, etc. in the field.  With the anticipated contract vehicle, CBP will be able to acquire canines as the need arises.  The canines that will be procured under the contract will be examined and trained at both of the CBP facilities mentioned above, however, before Government acceptance, CBP will require that each canine pass a medical examination and a series of tests.  These will be explained in detail in the RFP.  Specifically, the Government requires one of the following breeds in meeting its requirement:  Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Dutch Shepherd, and Belgian Malinois.  The vendor will be required to provide canines of one of these breeds that also meets the following requirements:  1)  Lineage – canines that are European born or that are of European lineage traceable by two generations are preferred in this requirement, yet not required; 2)  Age – the canine shall have a documented age between 12 and 38 months; 3)  Weight – the canine shall weigh no less than 45 pounds and no more than ninety pounds; 4)  Size – the canine shall measure no less than 22 inches and no more than 30 inches at the shoulder; 5) Sex – the canine may be either male or female.

This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The Trackpoint II Plus is one of the integrated system components of the new PINS V5 that is presently under development and near delivery.  No other underwater navigation and positioning can be substituted in its place since the PINS V5 software was written to specifically interface with that system.  If another system were to be substituted in its place it would be an enormous cost and would cause a tremendous delay in the delivery schedule.  ORE Offshore is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Trackpoint II Plus system.  NAICS Code is 334511, FSC Code is 6605, SBA Size Standard is 750.

The last four digits of -0004 have been restated herein as five digits, -0004A, for administrative purposes only.  The Classification Code in the initial announcement was incorrect.  The Classification Code is hereby changed to 59 – Electrical and Electronic Equipment Components.  The RFP for this requirement was posted at http:www.fbo.gov on 5 January 2006.  Parties interested in this solicitation should look to that site using the RFP # N66604-06-R-0004.  Likewise, amendments to the RFP should be located using the N66604-06-R-0004 number.  With the exception of the Classification Code and the RFP Response date, all other aspects of the 28 Sept. 2005 Synopsis announcement remain the same.  The 28 Sept. 2005 Synopsis if repeated for your convenience as follows:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, has a requirement to contract for the development and fabrication of a versatile, safe and environmentally friendly water-impact location identifier to serve the test and evaluation needs of advanced munitions development programs. This project, identified as the Soft Impact Location Capability (SILC), will provide a modular, portable system to support full-envelope testing of advanced ordnance systems using shallow water ocean impact areas in lieu of traditional land-impact ranges. This approach locates ordnance impact areas in modest water depths (12-100 meters) that enable post-test recovery of the projectiles.  System must support remote command and control of the system and data telemetry over distances out to 50 n. miles.  A single contract will be awarded for the delivery of a set of first article components, and then followed by the delivery of the production quantities.  Procurement History:  Using a spiral development process, two contracts were previously awarded under BAA-043338  September of 2004, to develop initial prototypes under the spiral 1 phase.  One contract was awarded to C&M Technology, Inc. of Old Saybrook, CT for $512,142 and the other contract was awarded to METOCEAN Data Systems Ltd. (MARTEC Group) of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada for $512,000.  Both of these contracts resulted in a sea-test demonstration of the respective prototype systems.  Under spiral-2 development, the new acquisition being advertised herein will identify additional enhancements and requirements beyond what has been previously demonstrated by either C&M or METOCEAN.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the development of Loci Framework, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Code Support for Loci-based numerical analysis programs. Development will involve Loci Framework, the Loci-CHEM CFD code, other grid generation programs and general verification and validation activities. NASA/MSFC intends to procure this work from Mississippi State University Engineering Research Center (MSU ERC). The reason for going to the above university is they are the developer and maintainer of the Loci-framework. MSU ERC also continues to refine the Loci-framework and is the most logical, cost effective and efficient source for performing development work involving the Loci-framework. Significant expenditure of effort is required to train a competent application developer to develop applications using Loci-framework. MSU ERC has been exploring concepts that further abstract the computer science details of programming within Loci, thus reducing the initial financial and schedule burden of initiating the use of Loci-framework. The Government does not intend to acquire commercial services using FAR Part 12, instead the Government will acquire these noncommercial services using FAR Part 15.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 3:30 p.m. Central Standard Time on January 20, 2006. It is the request of this office that offerors notify via email of their intent of submitting their statement of capabilities for this work by January 10, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All communications and capabilities/qualification statement shall be sent via email.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Department of Homeland security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG, Telecommuncation and Informations Systems Command (TISCOM), has a requirement for underway connectivity using the Inmarsat B satellite system. The communications suite will be installed on the PC-179 class cutter to provide voice (clear and STUIII) service, fax service and data capabilities to 128Kbps. The United States Coast Guard connectivity architecture employs pre-paid satellite leases on the 2nd generation Inmarsat satellite constellation (98W, 142W, 143.5E, 25E) along with 3rd generation (on-demand services) as an available backup to the primary lease. Primary Inmarsat B use is 128Kbps data operation linking the mobile unit to the shore side Land Earth Station (LES). The LES must backhaul the mobile unit data via terrestrial path to the U.S. Coast Guard network. Variable Bandwidth Service (VBS) allows sharing of one 2nd generation satellite lease between two underway cutters providing simultaneous 24X7 64 Kbps thruput to each cutter. DHS/USCG has concluded their requirements will best be met through a custom configuration. The system is manufactured by NERA Telecommunications and supported only by Mackay Communications in the United States. DHS/USCG intends to negotiate with Mackay Communications on a sole source basis. Mackay Communications is the sole U.S. distributor of all NERA equipment. Any contractor contemplating this requirement should know that the Inmarsat B systems must be CN-17 compliant and operate with 2nd and 3rd generation satellites that have LES capabilities to backhaul mobile data to the U.S. Coast Guard data network. CN-17 compliance is mandatory due to the U.S. Coast Guard purchase of United States Navy 2nd generation satellite leases and their associated satellite provider (LES platform). The requirement must contain the following: 1) Inmarsat B suite must be CN-17 compliant 2) high speed data option up to 128Kbps and VBS capable 3) rotary joint with installation 4) serial printer 5) system certification & 2-yr parts/labor warranty 6) STUIII option and 7) storage at vendors site until needed 8) Dome must be gray in color. Due to immediate USCG operational commitments, delivery must be on or before 10 February 2006. It is contemplated that award shall be made utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No telephone inquiries will be honored.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate with Northrop Grumman Defense Mission Systems, 222 W 5th Street, San Pedro, CA 90733 for a five year cost plus fixed fee contract in support of an effort entitled Open Skies Management and Planning System (OSMAPS).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The objective of this effort will be to leverage upon previous work conducted by Northrop Grumman to achieve Final Operational Capability (FOC) of the OSMAPS, and to maintain continuity with other Open Skies systems utilized to support Open Skies Treaty missions.  Significant technical problems, to include 55 mission essential Software Problem Reports (SPRs), must still be overcome to achieve FOC.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved on October 3, 2005.  OSMAPS is a highly technical, comprehensive aircraft mission planning and mission management software and hardware system that supports the international Open Skies Treaty.  The system is comprised of six fully integrated functional areas to include the Active Overflight System (AOS), Passive Overflight Module (POM), Operational Planning System (OPS), Telephone Notification System (TNS), Transportable Operational Planning System (TOPS), and the Data Preparation Facility (DPF).  It is also essential to integrate the new proprietary Auto Router capability developed by Northrop Grumman into OSMAPS.  The Auto Router is an automated flight planning tool that considers all of the Open Skies parameters, to include weather, treaty requirements, and objective sites in the database, and provides a recommended flight plan.  Implementation of this capability will require integration and addition of some unique Open Skies requirements.  Northrop Grumman has recently begun the PC conversion of the Integrated Data Annotation Recording and Mapping System (IDARMS) under another contract.  The IDARMS provides a real-time record of flight on the Open Skies OC-135 aircraft, including film annotation details to meet treaty requirements.  All aspects of OSMAPS and IDARMS software are interlinked to include the graphical user interface.  OSMAPS and IDARMS exchange complex mission data before and after all missions.  It is imperative to the success of the new development, and the Open Skies mission, that OSMAPS remains closely aligned with the planned IDARMS development.  Northrop Grumman also has specialized experience in the development of a new area mapping capability, which is essential to achieve FOC.  This capability will go into a particular geographical area with aircraft, sensor, and flying parameters and automatically develop a mission for the area.  This is a vital asset for humanitarian assistance missions that are called upon to take imagery of an area that has been affected by a natural disaster.  During this period, there will be ongoing treaty missions, overseas and in the United States, that would be jeopardized without in-depth, real time technical support for the new PC-based system.  Mission failure would violate the Government commitment to fulfill its treaty obligations and create significant compliance issues in international treaty fora and potentially endanger mission participants.  Northrop Grumman was initially chosen in the early 90’s because of their extensive B2 operational planning experience, in-depth treaty experience in Vienna, Austria, and aircraft sensor experience.  Today, Northrop Grumman is still the only contractor to combine these three critical planning components necessary to accomplish the Open Skies planning mission.  Combined with these components, Northrop Grumman is the only source that has the requisite combined knowledge of the new system, operational requirements, and treaty requirements to be able to complete the effort without disruption to the Open Skies Mission.  

The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation at this time would incur substantial duplication of costs during a lengthy transition period that would not be recovered through competition.  The Government has also determined that a lengthy transition at this time would cause delivery delays and jeopardize program execution.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS AND NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Interested parties have fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this Synopsis, to submit in writing, to the identified point of contact, clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities.  Such qualifications and/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after fifteen (15) days, or without the required information, will not be considered.    A determination by the Government not to compete this action at this time based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries must be submitted in writing to the address or e-mail address stated herein and to the attention of Ms. Elizabeth Colvin, Contract Specialist.  Responses to this notice must be received by close of business, January 20, 2006.  Responses must include your business name, point of contact, address, and telephone number with area code.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Requests may be e-mailed to  elizabeth.colvin@dtra.mil.  If no responses are received, an award will be made to Northrop Grumman.  Point of contact is  Elizabeth Colvin, 703-767-3496.

The solicitation will be available on its issue date of January 16, 2006 at http://dibbs.dscc.dla.mil/rfp. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This plan uses approximately 205,000 CY of sand in combination with geotextile/coconut fiber logs to contain the material and provide a buffer for wave energy.  At Elders Point West there will be 12 acres of low marsh and enhancement of 8 acres of existing low marsh.  Elders Point West will require 100,000 CY of sand in combination with geotextile/coconut fiber logs to contain t he material.

<CONTACT>Jillian Pate, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 292-8252, Fax (703) 292-9140, Email jpate@nsf.gov
<DESC>To Whom It May Concern:

The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is seeking information regarding the long-term (10 or more years) availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the re-supply of the U.S. Antarctic Program’s (USAP) McMurdo Station.  NSF is the U.S. Government Agency responsible for directing and funding the USAP, and manages the entire United States national program in Antarctica, including logistic support activities, so that the program may be managed as a single package.

Background

NSF is interested in contracting for icebreaking services to annually open a channel through 1-2 year 10/10ths sea ice, and then escort an ice-strengthened tanker and an ice-strengthened cargo ship to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77°51’ S, 166°40’ E.   NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement.   It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60° S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks.  After that period the vessel would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to perform the McMurdo break-in and ship escort service using its POLAR class ships.  However, these vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life.  NSF is now seeking alternative means of opening the supply channel to McMurdo Station through a reliable long-term arrangement, either with a commercial or governmental provider, or through a multi-national arrangement.     
 
NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c).


The United States Antarctic Program

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported by the United States Government in Antarctica.  The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research.  For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated.  U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research.  At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities.  The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations.

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station.  McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea.  It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail.  Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station.


Typical Schedule and Operations

The icebreaker typically arrives at 60° S on or about December 25.  Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival).   The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required

The freighter to be used during the 2005/2006 season will be the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m).    The tanker to be used will be one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/27.4m).   Use of supply ships of similar capacity and size are anticipated over the life of the contract.  Additional information on these vessels may be found at:

http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=paulbuck&type=GovernmentownedTanker.

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP.  The tanker arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16 each year, and departs on or about January 20 each year.  The freighter arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year, and departs on or about February 11 each year.

Sea Ice

The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo.  It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  Appendix I provides a listing of the extent of sea ice and the vessels used since 1957.   For the past four years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound.  For those past four years there has been extensive first year ice with some inclusions of second year ice extending from McMurdo to about 100 miles north.  Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet.  Ice in the channel has blown out to open water once in that four-year period, but the surrounding ice extending approximately 14 miles north from McMurdo is multi-year ice.  The two largest of the icebergs have moved out of the area since last year and it is expected that the coming season’s ice should start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods.

A chart showing sea ice thickness measurements for 1987 to 2004 is included as Attachment 2.  Recent archival images may be viewed at: http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets/?RossSea/, and http://www.polar.org/sat_image/

Evaluation Information

Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of icebreaking services; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted.  Except as identified herein, no specific format is required.  

Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an existing or to-be-built vessel for icebreaking services would be:

·	Vessel’s ice classification and maximum ice thickness and speed of advance for continuous progress
·	Vessel’s displacement
·	Statement of availability
·	Ship’s registry
·	Vessel’s or vessels’ name and specifications using BIMCO Supplytime 89, Annex A as the format
·	Name/address of vessel’s owner and vessel’s operator (if different)
·	Certificate of current classification
·	Time remaining prior to any major maintenance activity and dry docking
·	Approximate price per day, and any extras (e.g., taxes, victuals, commissions, communications)
·	Expected mobilization and demobilization charges and port of initiation/return
·	Past performance contact information
·	Special operating restrictions or conditions

It is highly desirable that the vessel have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any re-fueling from McMurdo.  Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this.  

If the vessel must receive fuel during the period of time while operating in the Southern Ocean, McMurdo can provide an all purpose diesel fuel, JP-5.  Specifications for this fuel are set forth on Page 4 of the publication titled Fuel Users Guide, 2000.  It can be found at http://usapc.army.mil/miscellaneous/2000%20fuel%20users%20guide%20(sep%202000).pdf.  Respondents are asked to review this fuel specification and comment on its suitability.  If another diesel fuel must be used (e.g. MGO or MDO), NSF can have it delivered by the tanker coming to McMurdo.  Please provide an estimate of the quantity of fuel that must be delivered (fuel consumed during mobilization and during ice breaking operations up to the time of the scheduled tanker arrival).  There is no tankage for storage of specialty fuels in McMurdo, thus the fuel must be delivered directly from the tanker.  The tanker cannot deliver heavy fuels.  

Where fuel is expected to be provided at McMurdo, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the approximate price per day.

In the event of a need for heavy fuel, if necessary, the icebreaker could go to New Zealand to refuel – this will take time away from icebreaking duties and is not desirable.  Respondents are asked to indicate if this mode of refueling will be required. 

The Committee of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) is currently developing ballast water management plans for the Antarctic.  A draft management plan is attached.  Please comment on your ability to comply with this plan.


Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation.  Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to February 28, 2006 is requested.  Inquiries of a technical nature may be addressed to Mr. Michael Van Woert, Executive Officer, Office of Polar Programs, at the letterhead address, Room 755; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8030; or by e-mail to mvanwoer@nsf.gov.

We are formulating our acquisition strategy and this announcement is intended to notify industry  of information regarding the F-16 MTC requirement.  We anticipate releasing  the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for industry comment in August 2005 and  a final RFP in October 2005.  We expect contract award the following spring.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact the POC for this announcement at ASC.YW.F16SSPOC@wpafb.af.mil.  Interested offerors are  invited to register on the PIXS site for the acquisition.

This site can be reached by typing the following into your URL bar: http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil ************************************************************************ Question to Industry: Do you see any impact to awarding a non-commercial  (i.e., FAR Part 15) services contract instead of a commercial (FAR Part 12)  service contract for the F-16 MTC contract?  Would the use of a FAR 15 contract be  a substantial cost driver either for the initial award or possible contract changes after contract award?  Please provide all input by 3 October 2005. ************************************************************************ The DRAFT RFP is now posted below.  It consists of a DRAFT RFP Cover  Letter, the DRAFT RFP model Contract, and all the attachments (1-11 plus  Exhibit A)It is the SMSG's intention that one-on-one, Industry Day #2  meetings will be held between 31 Jan 06 and 3 Feb 06.

<SUBJECT>A--Requirements Development and Rapid Prototyping Testbed (RDRaPT) Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ06R0XXX
<RESPDATE>022006
<ARCHDATE>04212006
<CONTACT>Neal Dedicatoria, 703-325-3038
<DESC>Requirements Development and Rapid Prototyping Testbed (RDRaPT) Request for Information (RFI) Closing Date: 20 February 2006. The Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS); Project Officer for the Acquisition Domain (PO AD) Combat Development Integration Cell (CDIC) in partnership with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army Acquisition, Logi stics, and Technology (OASA(ALT)) is seeking industry information on available protocols, products, and technologies to facilitate the rapid defining of processes, requirements, and technologies to improve the way the Army acquisition domain conducts its b usiness.    Sources sought are requested to address available, processes, products, and technologies to provide a complete capability to rapidly define requirements within the Army Acquisition business process domain, and to prototype technologies that can  offer significant improvement.  The proposed solution must have the capability to produce data to help quantify the value improvement of those technologies or process changes. The analysis may cover the current policies, procedures, and tools used through out the acquisition lifecycle, from cradle to grave. The ultimate goal of this RFI is to identify expertise and knowledge in rapid prototyping processes and tools that can be utilized to facilitate requirements definization, technology exploration, and cost benefit analysis.  The optimum response will provid e useful information about state of the art technologies and tools, a high level implementation plan, and a proven track record in delivering this capability to industry or government organizations.   Background:   In an effort to streamline the current acquisition processes and to posture the Army for continued transformation, the OASA (ALT) and related activities have undertaken a review of their current business practices and supporting technologies.  This effort is concurrent with the Business Management Modernization Program, the Department of Defenses overarching initiative to assess business areas for efficiency and effectiveness, associated portfolio management activities, and the ability to meet and support the transformation requirements as defined in Joint vision 2020. The ASA(ALT) and PEO EIS have been directed to implement a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as the framework for enhancing the business of Army Acquisition.  This SOA will provide the infrastructure through which enterprise net-centric business systems will enable domain elements to create, manage and share the information and information management resources necessary to enable more efficient and effective business processes.   The Acquisition Domain will soon establish the Future Business System (FBS) Program responsible for developing and fielding the SOA and the suite of enterprise net-centric business tools that will continuously evolve to provide improving and more efficient business support to the domain. However, the Acquisition community has little experience with Service Oriented Architectures, net-centric systems, and shared data spaces.  Although there is a clear requirement for secure information, interoperable systems, agile business processes and pr actices, and greater efficiency in the creation, management and sharing of information, there is no clarity in what improvements are possible, what technology can enable, or how to state clear requirements for enhanced business capabilities.   Description:   To overcome this problem, the domain is seeking to explore the use of a requirements development and technology prototyping test-bed.  This test-bed will provide a mechanism to bring users together with state-of-the-art information management technologies in a mock SOA environment to enable rapid prototyping of process changes and exploration of technology options.  PEO EIS is looking for industry ideas on how such a requirements development and material prototypin g test-bed could be accomplished.  The PEO is seeking information on how such a test-bed might be designed, operated and/or matured so as to provide the desired support to the Future Business System Program.  Information sought would include technical appr oaches, information on previous experience with similar approaches, and draft scenarios that can be used to validate each proposed approach. This requirement applies to all elements of the acquisition domain.  It applies directly to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA (ALT)), its Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct Reporting Program Managers ( DPMs), Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and subordinate PMs.  It also applies to those organizations not directly reporting to the ASA (ALT), but which have a substantial role in the planning, management, and/or execution of the life-cycle management proc ess defined by DoD Directive 5000.2.  This includes but is not limited to Test & Evaluation (T&E) Organizations; Army Materiel Command (AMC), Army Laboratories; Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM); and the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA). Additionally, the requirement should address the interface between the anticipated Future Business System and the other enterprise systems across the Army and DoD.  The goal is to establish the requirements for the FBS program so that it takes advantage of and works seamlessly with evolving enterprise systems across domain and Service lines and with evolving Net-Centric Enterprise Services and other enterprise services such as AKO. The RDRaPT will be required to support the emulation, manipulation, and experimentation of the following acquisition domain functions; policy management, program management, earned value management, contract management, funds management, systems engineerin g, software acquisition management, test and evaluation, manufacturing and production, and logistics management and other acquisition functions across the life-cycle.  Capabilities: a.  Hardware:   The requirement is for computer hardware and associated peripheral equipment necessary to support the RDRaPT environment.  The proposed solution must explain how DoD information Technology Security Certification requirements will be satisfi ed b.  Software:  The requirement is for the requisite software to simulate, stimulate and emulate acquisition business processes in a service oriented architecture.  This software must be fully supported by the proposed hardware and provide an automated envi ronment to experiment with improved business processes and differing technologies.   c. Documentation:  Relevant documentation of the results, feedback, and data from the RDRaPT is required to document requirements and provide information to perform relevant analysis.  The information should be presented in an easily understood format and should not require significant data reduction efforts.     d. Data:  All data flowing through the RDRaPT should be in accordance with industry best standards and the government financial data standard or other government data standards.  e. Interfaces/Edge resources:  The RDRaPT must take into account edge resources and domain interfaces.  It must provide the ability to show the interface points and have the ability to provide full duplex data exchanges at these points.     PEO EIS is looking for suppliers who can provide an integrated capability that incorporates the above capabilities.  All respondents are asked to provide the following: 1.	A technical description of potential solution(s) or complete capability.  The description should answer the following questions: a.	What part of the overall capability your solution addresses? b.	How does your solution work?  What are its limits? c.	What are the physical dimensions of the environment?   d.	How effectively has your solution been used in the past or related applications? e.	What evidence exists that your solution is applicable if it has not been specifically used for this type of work? f.	How mature is your system?  Is it new development?  Does a prototype exist?  Is it similar to previous successful developments?  Is it an extension or evolution of an existing product?  g.	A schedule estimate from contract award to operational capability for each proposed solution. 2.	A high level cost estimate of establishing the environment and any associated costs with running the RDRaPT . 3.	Recommendations where outcomes can be traded for reduced costs or where enhancements can be added for little or no cost. RFI Purpose and Limitations: The Governments intention is to better understand the current state-of-the-art and to determine the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.

Detailed questions on format and minor  issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address omissions  and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired. XR-SIMAF Library  The XR-SIMAF Library is not available until 19 Oct 05 between the hours of  0900 and 1500 EST.

Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings  will be loaded to PIXS and will available for download by COB 15 Jun 05.  ******************************************************************************Update: Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 Thefollowing sentences have been modified in the following synopsis toreflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

<DESC>IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS CAPABLE OF ASSISTING WITH DEVELOPMENT OF RADIATION TREATMENT DOSIMETRY PLANNING SOFTWARE AND EXPLORING COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON THE SOFTWARE.  Announcement:  Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners, capable of assisting with the development of, and implementing, BEA proprietary software useful for dosimetry planning for all forms of radiation treatment.  A Research Version of MINERVA (Modality-Inclusive Environment for Radiotherapeutic Variable Analysis) is copyrighted.  Programming and interfaces are written in Java to provide maximum portability and use of plug-ins.  The successful partner will be interested in entering into a research and development agreement to further develop the core program and proprietary plug-ins for one or more modalities, to enter into a license agreement, or both, for the purpose of developing and selling commercial versions of the software.  License terms would include an up-front licensing payment, minimum annual royalties and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  A research and development agreement would be under a standard CRADA arrangement with an option for licensing subject inventions.   Note:  THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY BEA TO ENTER INTO EITHER A LICENSE AGREEMENT OR A COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH ANY COMPANY.   A description of the technology follows: the Research Version of MINERVA includes a Patient Module, Image Module, Model Module, Analyze Module, a Database and an API interface.  Plug-ins that are not a part of the Research Version are at various stages of development and include Molecularly Targeted Radiation Source and Transport Modules (in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of California, Davis), external beam source and transport modules, and neutron/photon transport modules.  MINERVA is designed to accept future source and transport plug-ins – both open source and proprietary.  MINERVA is designed to be a true multi-image, multi-treatment modality, Monte-Carlo based, high-speed, three-dimensional computational dosimetry and treatment planning system for radiotherapy.  Plans call for incorporation of patient motion and repositioning functions for Image-Guided Radiation Therapy, incorporation of deformable shape models, tracking of organ/tumor contours from initial CT scans, quantifying measured organ motion and incorporation of the movable patient into the PEREGRINE Monte Carlo dose calculation scheme.  In addition, MINERVA will be designed to interface directly with the web-based quality assurance Remote Review Tool.  This will allow dose re-calculation and side-by-side plan comparisons for clinical trial planning data.  Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in exploring commercial opportunities for BEA's MINERVA should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following: 1) company name and address; 2) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address for a point of contact; 3) a brief description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology; and 4) a brief description of how the company might commercialize this technology.  The statement of interest should be made by US mail or e-mail and should be received within 30 days of publication of this opportunity at the following address: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Advisory Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, BEA, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805. E-mail is John.Snyder@inl.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, desires information which will serve as a market survey and assist the Government in determining the feasibility and affordability of providing a family of guided rocket solutions to be integrated into the current 5-inch Zuni rocket system for fixed and rotary wing aircraft.  Weapon solutions should provide a lethal capability against fixed and moving targets in clear, obscured, and adverse weather conditions. 
The Government desires approaches that provide a low cost guided rocket capability that meets a fielding requirement of FY12 after a development start in FY09. The concept is to utilize the 5-inch Zuni unguided rocket as the basic airframe. It is anticipated that a Semi Active Laser seeker would be a baseline requirement to provide the clear weather capability. Additional information for other guidance modes to address the adverse/through the weather capability is also requested. It is further anticipated that the basic configuration would initially utilize the MK32 Mod 0 anti tank/personnel and MK63 high explosive warheads and MK 71 Mod 2 rocket motor. It is anticipated that a launcher redesign would be required to accommodate the additional length of the guidance package.
The All Up Round must be capable of being delivered at the component level (guidance section, rocket motor, warhead, and fuze). The system must provide backwards component compatibility with the current Zuni rocket products as much as possible. 
The Government is considering two approaches: 
The first is a low-cost approach to develop a guidance and control package utilizing existing rocket motors and warheads, for integration on the F/A-18 C/D for shore-based operations only.  Minimal aircraft software and no aircraft hardware modifications are required. This approach should provide the architecture for future growth of weapon capability and platform integration. 
The second approach is to develop a guidance and control package, improve the IM performance of the rocket motor and warhead, incorporate a “smart rocket launcher” to provide the ability to set weapon laser codes from the cockpit and communication to and from the weapon, and allow for land and ship board operations (to include MIL-STD-1901 and MIL-STD-1316 compliance), all for integration on the F/A-18 C/D & E/F as an all inclusive program.
Responses should address the following areas: 
1.	Technical Approach
2.	Lock On After Launch/Lock On Before Launch trade offs   
3.	Impact of design alternatives on aircraft integration 
4.	Maximum Range Performance
5.	Minimum Range Performance
6.	Probability of hit (P/hit) and accuracy 
7.	Impact of design alternatives on warhead lethality and   reliability 
8.	Guidance and control reliability, maintainability, and supportability
9.	Aiming requirements and other operational considerations
10.	 Weapon build-up, maintenance, and testing requirements 
11.	 Schedule and non-recurring and recurring cost implications 
12.	 Assessment of risk and technology readiness levels

Additional Information: Responses to this RFI shall also include, but are not limited to:  (a) A brief description of your company including name and address of firm, ownership, year firm established, its size, major products, primary customer focus; (b) A discussion of your company's past experience and performance at designing and producing guidance systems; (c) Customer Contacts, including Contracting Officer's and Technical points of contact names and telephone numbers in order for NAVAIR to validate your statements; (d) Any other technical information respondents deem necessary to aid the Government in making an informed assessment.  Responses should be limited to 25 pages of documentation.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.  Submitted data will not be returned.  

Foreign Participation. This program will require a development effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms. To participate a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program and subsequent product improvements. Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. The U.S. Government will provide foreign disclosure guidance to the U.S. firms.

Technical References:  Additional technical information will be made available to potential respondents of the RFI upon request. Information available includes product specifications and top-level assembly drawings for Zuni components.   

Important Information: Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal Request for Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.   There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above.

The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  

It is anticipated that an additional RFI may be released within 6 months of receipt of responses to this RFI that will provide further programmatic detail. 


Written responses, either via email or fax, must be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. 19 February 2006.

<SUBJECT>D -- RFI on Data Model Harmonization and Visualization Tools
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
On
Data Model Harmonization and Visualization Tools




Background

The Inter-agency Core Data Types Working Group is chartered to define and develop core data models for use in cross-agency information exchanges.  A core data model is a data model applicable across more than one information domain.  To facilitate the rapid development of such core data models the group seeks information from vendors on tool support for data model harmonization and visualization.

Information Requested

Provide information on software tools to support data harmonization process as described in the following paragraphs.

Data Model Harmonization is the process of comparing similar conceptual and logical data models to determine the common data elements, similar data elements and dissimilar data elements in order to produce a resulting unified data model.  Some possible features of a Harmonization tool are:

•	Import.  The ability to import data models into the tool from various representation formats including: 
o	Entity Relationship Models (i.e. ERWIN).
o	Unified Modeling language (UML).
o	eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema.
o	Resource Description Framework (RDF).
o	Web Ontology Language (OWL).
•	Analyze.  The ability to linguistically and semantically analyze the components of multiple data models to determine equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity.
•	Visualize.  The ability to construct multi-modal views of the data models to assist in comparison analysis.  Possible visualizations are:
o	“Side-by-Side” visualization.  The process of comparing models must be supported by robust “side-by-side” visualization of two or more data models.  
o	Similarity visualizations with lines and color shading to represent equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity.
o	Other innovative visualizations to reveal subtle linguistic or semantic aspects of the data.
•	Collaborate.  The ability to harmonize and visualize models with multiple users simultaneously and to jointly create the resultant data model.
•	Create.  The automated ability to extract common data elements across models to produce a new resultant skeleton model that can be further refined by a manual process.
•	Transform.  The ability to map and convert the source data models into the resultant format or other source formats.
•	Export.  The ability to save the resultant data model in multiple representations (the same set of representations available to import).


Responses 
Responses should be identified with an RFI No., and are due by February 28, 2005. Please send a Microsoft word document with your response electronically to MCOE@dhs.gov .

This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a cooperative agreement on the basis of responses to this RFI nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government’s use of such information.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Intent to Award a Contract Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
<DESC>The Department of State intends to negotiate a sole source contract with American Systems Corporation located at 13990 Parkeast Circle, Chantilly, VA  20151-2272 for installation services of classified and unclassified cable and conduit.   The base period of the contract will be six months with a six-month option period.   The authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  This action is being taken to provide for continuity of services upon the expiration of contract S-LMAQM-00-C-0076 and will allow for the negotiation and award of the follow-on contract.    Use of another contractor during this period would result in the disruption of services and would necessitate costly start-up and transition costs to be repeated on award of the follow-on contract.   The contractor must provide BICSI Certified Technicians and a BICSI Registered Communications Designer (RCDD) on staff to support all project requirements. Foreign travel may be required and employees expected to travel will require a Top Secret security clearance prior to departure. In addition, the contractor shall possess a Top Secret facility clearance and all personnel performing under the contract shall have a Top Secret-SCI or Secret clearance as designated by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.    Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by January 19, 2006.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   No phone calls will be accepted and voice mail messages will neither be acknowledged nor returned.

<DESC>Agro-industries – Regional Investment Advisor

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included
in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number 
ADF-06-CI-003 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-18. The African Development Foundation (ADF), a U.S. Government Corporation fostering grassroots participatory development in Africa, is recruiting one or two individuals on a personal service contract basis for the position of Regional Investment Advisor(s).

Background: The process of globalization - involving global and regional economic integration driven by technological advances and trade liberalization and harmonization of policies - presents both threats and opportunities for existing agro-based industries in African countries.  The penetration of the market economy into Africa’s formerly isolated and remote areas opens up opportunities for raising agricultural and agro-industrial productivity, but it also poses acute challenges, particularly for African countries, where the agro-industrial sector faces increased regional and global competition and market volatility as a result. 

The same challenges are also faced by the African Development Foundation (ADF).  ADF and its local partners are required to make fundamental changes in policies, programming strategies, utilization of best practices and lessons learned, organizational linkages and the provision of skills and support services to better enable the enterprises they support to compete in regional and global markets. It is in this connection that the services required from the Agro-Industries – Regional Investment Advisor will make a vital contribution to the development of profitable, efficient and sustainable agricultural and agro- enterprises enterprises supported by ADF.

These services are usually provided in close conjunction with related program and project support services offered by ADF country partners and regional program advisors.  The services to be provided are at the center of ADF’s agro-industrial value chain programming strategy.  Thus, the services will serve to strengthen forward and backward agro-enterprise linkages within countries and within ADF’s portfolio in order to raise productivity and increase the potential for promoting growth in agricultural production, value added processing, export and employment generation. 
The work plan and service module associated with ADF’s agro-industrial programming will include the development and dissemination of sector and product analyzes, best practices, lessons learned, templates, tools and guidelines to assist ADF’s targeted beneficiary enterprises with their development and implementation of effective business strategies, operations and production management, financial management, resource mobilization, market access, and knowledge management.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for exposure matrices services for the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration.  The Government plans to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract established on the basis of firm-fixed rates for labor hour services.  This is a Request for Proposals (RFP) DOL069RQ20142.  I. BACKGROUND   Public Law 106-398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) of 2000, as amended (the Act), established a program to compensate nuclear weapons program workers who suffered adverse health effects from exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards in the course of their nuclear weapons program-related work.  The President, in an Executive Order dated December 7, 2000, assigned program implementation responsibilities to various executive departments.  The Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Bush on October 28, 2004, abolished Part D of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) and replaced it with a new system of federal payments called Part E to be administered by the Department of Labor (DOL).  The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) has responsibilities under Part E of the EEOICPA to issue decisions concerning whether certain employees of DOE contractors or subcontractors contracted occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the work environment.  It is essential that DEEOIC have accurate, timely, and useful information regarding the toxic substances used at DOE sites throughout the United States.  The DEEOIC currently has records from DOE related to:  DOE Former Worker Programs (i.e. needs assessments), site reports (i.e. Tiger Team Reports, Environment Safety and Health reports, site history reports), operational safety procedures, environmental impact reports, job descriptions/labor categories, exposure assessment reports, accident investigation reports, field logs, emergency management plans, lists of chemicals utilized at the sites, industrial hygiene records and epidemiological studies.  
The challenges to developing useful data to identify exposures are considerable.  Many of the records do not exist or are not retrievable; some facilities no longer exist and the documentation has been archived; most sites had thousands of toxic substances present.  Data may be available from DOE Headquarters, DOE field sites, the Former Worker Program, as well as other locations.  Data sources may include industrial hygiene records, occupational medicine records, epidemiology data, personnel records, union records, etc.  The Contractor shall also gather information from current and former employees of DOE at the DOE sites.  This may be accomplished in a roundtable type discussion.
The data currently maintained and the additional data that will be identified and obtained by the Contractor will be used by Claims Examiners to conduct research of DOE facilities and uranium mines and mills as an informational tool to assist with adjudication of claims under the Act.  This information will be used to validate information obtained from DOE or from the claimants.
The successful Contractor will have extensive institutional knowledge of the current and historical operations performed at the DOE facilities; uranium mines and mills, and be able to relate toxic exposures to this information.  The Contractor must have access or the ability to gain access to documents and data that identifies toxic substances used in specific sites or by specific occupations, and to analyze the data and present it in a manner for efficient adjudication of claims.  This may include an established contractual relationship with subcontractors such as the Former Worker Program, research universities, or others.  Some of this information may be classified and may include data covered under the Privacy Act.  The Contractor must have a security clearance with DOE or the ability to obtain a clearance and have secure space to maintain classified documents.
The Contractor shall perform field work to complete the data development for the 12 sites currently identified in the government owned database.  The Contractor shall identify DOE sites and data for completion of additional 15 sites.  The Contractor shall provide a plan for developing data and completing the remaining DOE facilities.
II. SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall perform field work, analyze data, validate and complete the current data provided by DEEOIC for the 12 sites partially developed in the database.

The Contractor shall query current and former workers of DOE to assist in enhancing the data.  The DEEOIC will review and approve the order of site development to include completion of 15 additional sites.  The contractor shall provide recommendations for records that should be utilized for the exposure matrices and develop the data input.  The Contractor shall research and identify occupations at covered DOE sites, building numbers where particular types of work were performed, and the toxic substances present at the sites.  The Contractor shall further identify the timeframes during which particular toxic substances were present and the diseases related to those toxic substances.  The Contractor shall establish Quality Control procedures for validating data.  The Contractor shall develop and submit a plan for completing the exposure matrices for the remaining DOE facilities.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

C.1  Statement of Work (Jul 1999)

The Contractor shall provide the necessary services and supplies as described in the Statement of Work, incorporated by reference in Section J.

(End of Clause)

Background:

The Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99 499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is required to conduct peer review on studies and other research which are to be the basis of environmental public health policy.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide a mechanism for obtaining peer review for Toxicological Profiles, associated unpublished studies, and other agency products to address this requirement.
 
ATSDR is directed by congressional mandate to perform specific functions concerning the effect on public health of hazardous substances in the environment. These functions include public health assessments of waste sites, health consultations concerning specific hazardous substances, health surveillance and registries, response to emergency releases of hazardous substances, applied research in support of public health assessments, information development and dissemination, and education and training concerning hazardous substances.  This proposed procurement will provide support for the specific functions identified for the agency.

                                                              Statement of Work
 
 
The purpose of this proposed contract is to support ATSDR in carrying out the mission as identified by the agency.
 
Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall perform the following tasks as specified in individual task orders issued by the Government: 
 
1.         Peer Review.  Provide peer review for Toxicological Profiles, health and chemical specific consultations and other documents prepared by or submitted for review by the agency.  This work includes identifying reviewers with appropriate expertise, insuring and documenting the lack of conflict of interest in the review process, developing a plan for managing the review process within the time frame and within the context of the government needs, and providing reports in hardcopy or electronic format as appropriate in a manner most expeditious for utilizing the information in document development or review. 
 
2.         Expert Panel and other meeting support.  Provide a menu of panel meeting or conference support depending on the purpose, plan and objectives of the meeting.  Working with the Project Officer and Technical Contact, identify critical experts to participate in this activity.  Contact individuals to participate¡¦, develop a contract for services if necessary, develop travel plans, establish the facility for the meeting and coordinate post-meeting activities.  Plan announcements or publicity for the meeting, develop web-based meeting support as needed for information, registration or other needs.  Arrange facilities for the meeting and coordinate meeting details.  Support conduct of the meeting in coordination or registration procedures, audio-visual support and operation, facilitation of discussion periods, receptions and other meeting activities.   
 
3.         Educational support.  Working with the Project Officer and Technical Contact, identify best approach, plan and media for educational support program.  Identify technical experts to participate in training activity, establish necessary contract and other arrangements, and identify means for monitoring training or educational progress.  If needed, work with CDC training offices to insure training credit certification. 
 
4.         Support for terrorism preparedness and response.  Working with the Project Officer and Technical Contact, devise an effective plan to support preparedness and response activities.  Components for this support may include special consultants, personnel with preparedness or response skills, media or materials to support agency collaborators, depending on program needs.  In certain instances, support personnel may be needed to provide surge capacity as a supplement to ATSDR Emergency Response sectional activities.  Depending on the situation and circumstances, support materials or other training materials may be required.  
 
5.         Expert Consultants.  Many program activities require outside assessment or expertise in addressing issues.  Contractor working with the Project Officers identifies expertise and characteristics necessary for expert consultants.  Contactor establishes contractual arrangements with consultants, devises work plan and time frames for addressing agency program needs, and insures timely receipt of deliverables for the project.
 
6.         Support for agency partners.  The agency has significant activities with state and local communities in addressing issues of exposure to toxic substances.  In some instances supplemental support will be needed in activities such as risk assessment, addressing community concerns, medical briefings, health studies and other programs conducted by the agency.  In certain instances, the need to bring independent resources separate from the agency may be required to appropriately address the issues of concern.  The Contractor, in consultation with the Project Officer, defines the necessary support for state or local public health groups.  The contractor develops a work plan to meet this technical requirement including:  experts consultants, plan of action, deliverables including final report if appropriate, materials to be developed or provided, and special expertise or activities dictated by the situation
 
            7.          Other Support services.  Other support services for environmental public health activities include the planning and conducting of health studies, the development of novel methods, including computational toxicology, for obtaining supplemental information on hazardous substances and the translation of critical  articles associated with important objectives.

In developing each task order, deliverables from the contractor will be separately identified.  The contractors task proposals will identify the technical approach to be used for the work, address issue of conflict of interest, identify schedule and deliverables and describe staffing plan.  All draft and final reports will be delivered to the government in the agreed upon schedule. The contractor shall deliver the items specified in the approved task order to the Project Officers at the following address: 4770 Buford Highway, Building 101, MS F-31, 3rd Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30341.

DIVISION OF TOXICOLOGY PEER REVIEW PROCEDURES  
ATSDR is required by Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99-499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, to use peer reviewed literature in its publications. Within the Division of Toxicology, the Emergency Response and Scientific Assessment Branch (ERSAB) provides the coordination of the peer review of Toxicological Profiles, Technical Reports, and relevant unpublished studies. The development of these documents is coordinated by the Toxicology Information Branch. This peer review process is done in accordance with the legislation mentioned previously and within guidelines established within the CDC/ATSDR Information Quality Peer Review which can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/od/ophr/infoqualpeerreview.htm
Information accepted as peer reviewed:
„@    Reports from peer reviewed journals, 
„@    Federal government reports that have an agency publication 
number, 
„@    Federal government contract reports that do not have an agency publication number but have a National Technical Information Service. (NTIS) number, 
„@    Proceedings of a symposium, and

„@    Books. 
Information not accepted as peer reviewed: 
„@    A doctoral dissertation or thesis that has been prepared as a 
requirement for college graduation and has not subsequently published in a peer reviewed journal or a book, 
„@    Non-peer reviewed journal (with exceptions e.g., Chemosphere, Environmental Health Perspective, and MMWR), 
„@    Industry reports, and 
„@    Federal government reports without an agency publication number or NTIS number. 
Information we do not have peer reviewed:

„@    Material ,Safety Data Sheets (MDSD), 

„@   Tables of numbers without supporting documentation to allow evaluation, 
„@   Abstracts (Note: Only in rare instances are abstracts ever included in a profile.) 


The process: 
„@   ATSDR issues a task order to Contractor for activity related to the contract. For most task orders, ATSDR submits: The list of profiled substances; set specific "Guidance for the Development of a Toxicological Profile;" and "Guidelines for Peer Review of ATSDR Profiles." 
„@   Contractor issues a work plan and cost estimate for performing the task order. 
„@   ATSDR accepts the work plan and estimate, or asks for modifications and/or clarifications before approval. 
„@ After approval of the task order for the profile set with the Profile Development Contractor, the schedule for profile set including peer review is shared with Contractor.

„@    Contractor provides ATSDR a list of potential reviewers (average of 5-8), in a prioritized order, with expertise in the field or the particular substance.Contractor confirms with the potential reviewers that there is no conflict of interest. The Chemical Manager reviews the list and then either approves the list or makes suggested changes in the prioritized order or suggested additions to the list. 
„@   The Chemical Manager decides which studies are to be peer reviewed. This may be done in consultation with the contract author. Using the criteria listed previously, the Chemical Manager selects the studies to be peer reviewed. It is not necessary to peer review "all" unpublished studies, only the studies that may have a significant contribution (not "me too" data) to the data known about the substance.  After the peer review of unpublished studies is approved by the Project Officer, the list of unpublished  studies to be reviewed is transmitted to Contractor by E-Mail.
„@    Contractor coordinates with the profile development contractor to prevent and handle any problems. 
„@    CONTRACTOR provides ATSDR and the profile contractor copies of the "Summary Report of Reviewer Comments on the Toxicological Profile for substance x" for each profile. This report may contain: The peer reviewers' summary reports; evaluation of unpublished studies; additional references and data submitted by the peer reviewers; and annotated pages from peer reviewers' profile documents. 
„@   If applicable, the Chemical Manager looks at each peer reviewer's evaluation of the unpublished study (this is in the "Summary Report of Reviewer Comments. ..") and decides if at least two of the three peer reviewers agree on the quality of the study. 
„@   The Project Officer will provide the Chemical Manager a form to use in rating the reviewers. 

 Miscellaneous 
„@   If an unpublished study is in a foreign language it must be translated before it is submitted for peer review.
