<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Gordon N. Stowe & Associates, Inc. for ICS Chartr 200 VENG/ENG System, supplies, related accessories and services for the VAMC North Chicago, located in North Chicago, IL.  In addition, the procurement will include the trade-in of existing VAMC North Chicago ICS ENG System, recorder, and irrigator.  To the best of our knowledge the ICS Chartr 200 VENG/ENG System is the only equipment which will meet the needs of the facility and has the ability to read data from existing system and has full integration of caloric irrigator that enables the operator to start ICS Chartr 200 VENG/ENG System and irrigator simultaneously.  The ICS Chartr 200 VENG/ENG System has the ability to be upgraded from VENG/ENG to include evoked potentials and otoacoustic emissions.  In addition, the ICS Chartr 200 VENG/ENG System is the only system that offers the VA to automatically center to compensate for drift during ENGs and have fully functioning remote control to enable operator to spend more time with the patient.  This can only be accomplished by the ability to read data from existing system and has full integration of caloric irrigator enabling the operator to start ICS Chartr 200 VENG/ENG System and irrigator simultaneously and is compatible with existing equipment used by VAMC North Chicago, IL.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1; “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements".  Contract type is firm-fixed price and the NAICS Code is 334510. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and service, to the Contracting Officer within (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information must be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC GLAC, 5000 W. National Ave Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Gordon N. Stowe & Associates, Inc..

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number DG133C-06-RQ-0827 is issued as a request for quotation. This announcement is a re-issuance of a previous solicitation, Solicitation Number NCNR0000-6-00021. The primary North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) has a requirement for Environmental Consulting Services in support of a coral reef restoration project in Vieques, Puerto Rico.  The goals of this requirement are to test various materials and artificial reef structural designs to determine whether certain materials and forms are preferable to others in terms of the success of coral settlement and growth and the survival of corals transplanted to these structures, and to determine which structural forms are preferable in terms of habitat for other benthic and mobile reef organisms.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) compare different materials such as cement, ceramic, and coral rock to examine differences between coral settlement and growth and coral transplant survival; 2) compare different artificial reef structures with varying shapes and forms to determine the  influence of structure on coral reef settlement, growth, and transplant success, settlement and growth of other sessile marine organisms, and use by mobile reef organisms; and 3) produce a report containing findings and recommendations regarding the use of artificial structures to rebuild damaged coral reefs in terms of both materials and forms.  NOAA requires information regarding settlement and transplant success of the staghorn (Acropora cervicornis) and elkhorn (A. palmata) coral species on artificial  structures in order to determine whether potential impacts from cleanup activities can be mitigated for these two threatened species using artificial reef structures in areas where spawning populations and sources of transplants of these species are present. NOAA shall use artificial reef structures in coral restoration off Vieques Island and requires the testing of various materials and artificial reef structural designs to determine which structural forms are preferable in terms of habitat. A combination of structural forms and materials shall be proposed to create a minimum of three different artificial reef structures.  Each of the three structures shall be used to test coral settlement and settlement of other sessile benthic organisms to artificial reef structures with and without coral transplants. A minimum of two replicates of each structure is requested, which will result in a minimum of twelve total structures. The project shall take place off Blue Beach in Vieques, Puerto Rico. The period of performance shall be from the date of award through twenty-four (24) months. The Government estimates that approximately $75,000.00 will be required for this  work.

STATEMENT OF WORK
                                                   CRUSTAL MOTION MODEL
					     August 14, 2006  

SCOPE OF WORK – A Contractor is needed to develop an analytical model representing horizontal crustal motion in the western conterminous United States, with emphasis on the States of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Idaho.  

BACKGROUND – Congress has mandated that NOAA’s National Geodetic Survey (NGS) establish and maintain the U.S. National Spatial Reference System (Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, Public Law 80-373, Title 22 U.S. Code 883a, 1947; The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, Public Law 107-372 reauthorized December 19, 2002).  This responsibility requires NGS to provide appropriate information as to how the positional coordinates of a point on the Earth’s surface may vary as a function of time, for locations within the United States.  Hence, NGS needs an analytical model for predicting crustal motion, especially in the tectonically active western States.

ACTIVITIES :  The Contractor shall:

•	Develop an analytical model for horizontal crustal motion in the western conterminous United States.
•	Construct this model using constraints obtained from existing geodetic, geological, paleoseismological, and historic earthquake data, as well as other geodynamic considerations.  NOAA shall provide the Contractor with the set of velocity vectors currently being compiled under separate work.  The Contractor shall also use relevant velocity vectors that are available via EarthScope’s Plate Boundary Observatory.
•	Parameterize the model in terms of fault slip rates, rigid block motions, velocity gradient tensor components, and/or other such kinematic deformation parameters as necessary in order to satisfy all available information.
•	Encode the model as a Fortran77 subroutine, which will generate predicted horizontal velocities (referred to a reference frame in which the interior of the North American tectonic plate is stable) as a function of geodetic latitude and longitude throughout the western conterminous United States.
•	Document the applied analysis procedure and the resulting Fortran77 subroutine.
•	Assist NGS personnel to incorporate the Fortran subroutine into the Horizontal-Time Dependent-Positioning (HTDP) software.

DELIVERABLES – The Contractor shall provide to NOAA the following deliverables:

•	Quarterly reports stating deliverables completed, problems and unusual circumstances encountered, percent completion on other deliverables, and percent completed on the entire contract.
•	Maps and tables presenting residuals between the velocity vectors derived directly from the geophysical observations and the velocity vectors derived from the constructed model.
•	Within 9 months after the contract has been in effect, a prototype version of a Fortran77 subroutine that generates the horizontal velocity of any point in the western conterminous United States, when provided the geodetic latitude and longitude of that point on input.
•	Within 11 months after the contract has been in effect, the final version of this Fortran77 subroutine, together with an ASCII file documenting this subroutine.
•	Within 12 months after the contract has been in effect, the final report that includes a description of the geophysical data and the procedures used to develop the analytical model that has been encoded into the resulting Fortran77 subroutine. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE – 12 months, beginning in September 2006.

TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS – Travel will be at the discretion of the COTR.  The contractor is authorized a travel allowance for travel, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses in accordance with chapter 301-11 of the Federal Travel Regulations.  The maximum allowable per diem rates for travel within the continental United States are published in Appendix A of Chapter 301.  Current travel rates were effective October 1, 2005.  Lodging tax is reimbursable as a separate expense from lodging and may be claimed as a miscellaneous expense.  Reimbursement costs for business phone calls may also be claimed as miscellaneous expenses.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE – Contractor personnel assigned to this task shall perform all work at the contractor’s primary location, except when on assigned travel.

Discuss the success of the corrective action(s) taken. The Government intends to evaluate offerors based on Evaluation Commercial Items with paragraph completed as follows:  N00244M314     EVALUATION OF OFFERS – USING RESPONSIBILITY, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE CRITERIA (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO) ATTACHMENT 2 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Offerors will be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9 to ensure that prospective contractors have adequate financial resources, facilities, organization and integrity required to perform the contract. The following factors shall be used to further evaluate those offers which the contracting officer has determined to be responsible:        (i) PAST PERFORMANCE     (ii) PRICE Factor (i), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly more important than Factor (ii), PRICE. Although cost is not as important as past performance, it should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of proposals in relation to past performance, or when it is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the past performance superiority to the Government.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. (c)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (d)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to EDO Corporation of Amityville, NY for engineering support services to modify the design of an Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle (USSV) – High Tow Force to adapt it for potential use on a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  Software integration is a key element of the overall task.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The sweep system selected for use is the ONR-sponsored Unmanned Surface Sweep System (US3) originally designed and fabricated by EDO Corporation.  It is undergoing technology demonstration testing this summer and will be available to the Mine Warfare (MIW) Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) program this fall.  The USV selected to host the sweep system is a derivative of the ONR-sponsored Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicle (USSV) – High Tow Force.  Design for an updated var!  iant of the USSV is currently underway.  The design will incorporate changes that will facilitate LCS integration and installation of the sweep system.  The existing sweep system hardware produced in support of the ONR effort is intended to be re-used as completely as possible in support of the first MIW mission package to support LCS requirements.  EDO Corporation has unique knowledge that would require a 3 to 5-years learning curve from contractors not already experienced with this program.  NAICS code is 334511, FSC code is AC30, SBA size standard is 750 employees.

Experts in the area of QOL were invited to speak on the current state of knowledge regarding the incorporation of QOL endpoints in symptom management trials and to identify directions for future research.

Several Contractor Requirements: 1) Complete the production of a “Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monograph” that will contain the proceedings from the workshop; 2) Review, copy, edit, and publish, “Quality of Life Assessment in Symptom Management Trials” as a Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monograph; 3) Review each manuscript to ensure that the format is consistent with JNCI standard formatting, that tables and references are complete and correctly formatted, that language, syntax, and grammar are clear and correct, and that the tables and figures are explained and; 4) Publish the monograph,  (Monograph shall be no longer than 135 printed pages inclusive of front matter and illustrations).  The monograph editor (Scientific Coordinator) shall: 1) Identify and assign a reviewer to each manuscript/abstract for final clearance once complete; 2) Obtain final reviews and re-edit as needed for each manuscript and; 3) Submit completed manuscripts to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.  One hundred (100) total copies shall be provided to the NCI

Oxford University Press is the only source known that has acquired the Journal of the National Cancer Institute therefore, produces and publishes monographs in the JNCI.  The Journal of the National Cancer Institute has a target audience of clinicians and researchers interested in working in the area of quality of life and cancer care.   There are no known cancer journals with a readership that includes both of these groups.  Previously, Oxford University Press published a monograph in the JNCI reporting on the outcomes of the NIH State of the Science, on Symptom Management in Cancer Pain, Depression, and Fatigue.  This current monograph builds on this previous monograph already published.  No other cancer and health services research-oriented journal provides a comparable publication.

<DESC>It is the intent of National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole source basis from the Regents of the University of Michigan’s Digital Library Production Service the DLXS and XPAT Native XML search engine and middleware software.  This procurement requires a native-XML search engine developed for EAD, TEI, and OAI-PMH that is able to perform word and phrase searching, indexing of XML elements and attributes, basic valid and well-formed XML support (with Unicode), fast retrieval, with open systems integration.  As a single package, NLM will also purchase class middleware to mount and serve encoded texts on the world wide web in conjunction with the search engine.  
 
The University of Michigan Digital Library eXtension Service (UM DLXS) offers a suite of resources designed to aid educational and non-profit institutions mount a variety of types of digital library collections.  Since 1996, the University of Michigan Library has worked to serve a growing need for institutions like Michigan to put encoded text collections online.  DLXS offers both a search engine and a set of tools for mounting digital library resources.  The search engine, XPAT, is specially designed to handle large and highly structured documents and metadata such as that found in digital library efforts. 

The XPAT engine is an SGML- and XML-aware search engine, able to index, search and retrieve UTF-8 Unicode-encoded text data.  XPAT is based on the search engine previously marketed by Open Text as OT5(TM), and sometimes referred to as "Pat" and "Pat5.0." XPAT provides excellent support for word and phrase searching, indexing of XML elements and attributes, fast retrieval, and ease of integration with different software. 

DLXS seeks to enable digital library activities, particularly in the area of access/information retrieval for large collections of material.  To this end, significant resources are devoted to developing and supporting access mechanisms for many types of collections found in the digital library (e.g., continuous tone image collections, page image based books with associated OCR, and XML encoded books and journals).  A large and growing set of behaviors (such as types of searches and browses) is applied to these classes. 

The purchase order term will be September 30, 2006 through September 29, 2007 with options for four (4) successive one-year periods.  

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Contract Specialist, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<SOLNBR>PR-CI-06-11136
<RESPDATE>082906
<ARCHDATE>09282006
<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2092, E-Mail: tharp.scott@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Water Supply and Water Resources Division, 2890 Woodbridge Avenue, Edison, New Jersey, requires paving for the Urban Watershed Research Facility (UWRF).  Several different types of pavement are required.  Pavement type will be a mix of porous pavement (block and poured), hot mix asphalt (HMA) and paver stones.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, equipment, hardware, and documentation necessary to complete the project.  The project consists of two objectives:  (A) Connect parking lot and laboratories to the road leading up to the UWRF.   (B) Allow the evaluation of porous pavement as a method of stormwater treatment and volume control. The Contractor shall:  (1) Grade and trench the site as necessary so that the required pavements can be installed.  Approximately 3700 sq ft will need to be graded.  There are remnants of existing pavement under much of the area.  Grading and trenching shall adhere to current grade.  A 65 ft long, 2 ft wide trench shall be required for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  This trench shall carry piping and will be back-filled with pea gravel and capped with concrete block as described in the next section on porous pavement.   (2) Pave approximately 1560 sq ft with Porous Pavement.  Four separate segments shall be constructed with separate drainage for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  Two concrete treatments shall be used, blocks and poured pavement, each with two sections.  Each section shall measure 30 by 12 ft and be lined with an impermeable liner and a 2 in. diameter drainage pipe (HDPE 80) heat sealed to the liner.  The liner shall be puncture resistant, minimum of 6 mil thickness, and ideally should completely cover each section and sides to surface (15 ft by 35 ft).  The pipes shall be placed on top of liner and heat sealed at each end (four heat seals in all).  Drainage pipes shall be provided by EPA.   (3) A 10 ft wide and 140 ft. long vehicle access run of a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) strip is required from the end of the existing road to the greenhouse.  This should be as straight as possible given the layout of the facility and the requirements for the porous pavement above.  This asphalt strip should abut the new porous pavement. In addition, asphalt shall be used to connect the concrete pavement in front of the high bay to the new strip of asphalt.  An additional 10 by 60 ft and 10 by 12 ft section is anticipated.  Total estimated area of coverage is 2120 sq ft.   (4) The contractor shall provide five walkways connecting buildings to the new asphalt strip.  The location will be from the greenhouse, laboratory trailers, walk-in freezer, and high bay.  The width of walkway runs should match with access ways and doors.  The most economical method for walkway construction may be used.  However, a portion (10% to 33%) of these walkways for this task is required to be rubber sidewalks made from recycled tires.  These strips of recycled tires are anticipated to sit on a base material 2 to 4 inches thick with an impermeable liner beneath and are estimated to be 3 times as costly as concrete walkways.  Piping for drainage and monitoring will be provided.  The upper estimate of total walkway coverage is 250 sq ft.   Upon completion of each task identified above the EPA Project Officer will inspect the work for acceptance. Acceptance of the overall project will be by Contractor demonstration the installed Porous Pavement System performs as required by the objectives of this project.   A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Three (3) evaluation factors will be used: Technical Expertise, Past Performance and Price.  Technical Expertise and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price.  The anticipated contract performance period is 60 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  The estimated price of the work is between $25,000 and $100,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. The solicitation with specifications, drawings, and site visit information, will be released through the internet on the Fedbizopps website.  The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 15 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Scott Tharp, in writing, via fax (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov with questions.

<DESC>The Navy intends to issue a firm fixed-price order under Globecomm Systems, Inc. BPA W91RUS-04-A-0012 to procure on a sole source basis one (1) each Antenna Trailer system consisting of the following subsytems:  Antenna Subsystem, Redundant Ground Communications Equipment, Modem Subsystem,  Monitor and Control Subsystem, and Universal Chassis System Platform.   The system is transportable via a trailer and is rapidly deployable and operational in a short time frame.  It includes all necessary satellite antenna and related communications electronics and environmental control equipment and is powered by either a fixed power source or by an external generator.  The Antenna System will be used to provide on-site satellite reach-back communication capabilities to enhance incident command and control and is comprised of a number of different manufacturers pieces of  brand name mandatory equipment that are configured into one operating system, which if purchased separately would have to be integrated and the system re-created.  The Globecomm connectivity collaboration control system ensures interoperability with existing control systems and maintains the required configuration management, interoperability and interchangeability with previously procured and fielded systems.  Use of Globecomm’s Antenna System also reduces the total lifecycle cost of the system by ensuring commonality between the existing systems thereby reducing the costs of training and maintenance and reduces the quantity of spare parts that need to be procured for these systems.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  POC for this synopsis is Contract Specialist Patricia Rivenbark.

<SOLNBR>R1364
<CONTACT>Juan Gonzales juan.gonzales@lackland.af.mil
<DESC>The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Crypto Mod Program Office at Lackland AFB, TX is requesting comments in response to the questions listed below.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any formal solicitation will be independent of this request and announced separately. CPSG has embarked on a secure voice cryptographic modernization (CM) program for the KY-57/99, KY-58/100 and CV-3591/KYV-5 COMSEC products. The focus for Secure Voice Increment 1 is securing tactical voice radio transmissions.   The CPSG plans to field a modernized version of this equipment that meets the National Security Agency (NSA) Central Security Service (CSS) Policy Number 3-9 Cryptographic Modernization Initiative Requirements consistent with the Global Information Grid (GIG) secure voice architecture. CPSG intends to utilize an acquisition strategy that incorporates a multi-award contract to prove there is existing technology suitable to replace the following COMSEC products:  KY-57, 58, 99, 100 and CV-3591/KYV-5.  In addition, there may be opportunities for contract options for 1) system development and demonstration (develop, test, and obtain NSA certification) and 2) future follow-on production efforts.  The solution(s) must comply with the NSA 3-9 crypto mod tenants.  The resulting COMSEC product will be used to replace existing equipment (that for this initiative uses SAVILLE and/or PARKHILL) as well as provide a near term solution for similar applications in new or existing weapon systems. This modernized End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will implement multiple algorithms at the simultaneously including Saville (possibly PARKHILL), Suite A and Suite B algorithms, and will not address any IP addressable waveforms. The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified. For additional information see Word document under documents available for download.  Please send responses via email no later than 24 August 2006 to:  ronald.konicek@lackland.af.mil

<DESC>BACKGROUND

The National Weather Service (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is composed of nine National Centers.

    (1)   The Aviation Weather Center (AWC)
    (2)   The Climate Prediction Center (CPC)
    (3)   The Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)
    (4)   The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC)
    (5)   The NCEP Central Operations (NCO)
    (6)   The Ocean Prediction Center (OPC)
    (7)   The Tropical Prediction Center (TPC)
    (8)   The Space Environment Center (SEC)
    (9)   The Storm Prediction Center (SPC).

The core mission of NCEP is to provide weather analysis, forecasts, and warnings involving a wide range of atmospheric systems affecting the United States and the surrounding oceans.  

NCEP contains as many as four Service Centers (AWC, SPC, TPC, HPC) that require access to real-time radar data sets to perform their respective missions, specifically, using data from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network nationwide.

Currently, WSR-88D data is available within the NCEP Service Centers by means of a vendor (i.e. formerly known as a NIDS provider).  The radar data is displayed using National - Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (N-AWIPS) software after the radar data is retrieved from the vendor’s server located at each of the Service Centers.  Radar data is also displayed using a vendor stand-alone workstation, accessing the vendor server on site, capable of acquiring and displaying WSR-88D data from one site or nationally using a composite national mosaic data product created by the vendor.  NCEP Service Centers must have the ability to acquire and display, simultaneously, real-time data from all WSR-88Ds.

A critical requirement of the NCEP Service Centers is to be able to access in real time national radar mosaic products.  NCEP meteorologists perform a more complete 'meteorological watch' using the many radars and National Mosaic products provided in 
real-time under the existing NCEP radar contract.  The new NCEP radar contract will continue to provide the necessary remote sensing tools that are invaluable to the NCEP scientists in support of NCEP's mission to protect life and property.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this contract is three fold.  Some objectives are optional, specifically C.1 and D.1 below, and may be executed by the Government if available from the vendor.  

       A.   To supply a system at each participating Center capable of acquiring two types 
              of real-time radar data:
             (1)   National-scale, high resolution radar mosaics.      
             (2)  WSR-88D Product Data collected from the Radar
             Product Central Collection Dissemination Service 
             (RPCCDS) / NOAAPORT 

       B.   To make the following types of radar data available to Government systems at
              each participating National Center.
             (1)   National-scale, high resolution radar mosaics.         
             (2)  WSR-88D Product Data collected from the Radar
             Product Central Collection Dissemination Service 
             (RPCCDS) / NOAAPORT 

       optional:
       C.   To supply a system (that may be the same system as listed in objective "A") at 
              each participating Center capable of acquiring real-time WSR-88D level-II radar 
             data and to make the data available to Government systems.
             (1)   National-scale, high resolution radar level-II mosaics.

       optional:
       D.  If the supplied system at each participating Center utilizes a satellite ingest dish.
             (1)  On a per-center basis a satellite dish de-icer.
	 (2)  Dish shall be appropriately sized for latitude and climatology.

The Government will be responsible for the storage and display of the data furnished by the contractor on operational workstations.

In the contractor's proposal electronic examples of radar mosaics and single site data along with documentation on decoding the electronic data formats shall be provided.

THE RADAR DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

The contractor shall supply:

A.	A 24-hour per day customer support department to solve data acquisition, software and hardware problems with a 2-hour (support personnel) response time.  A fully capable support staff providing responsive assistance to Government personnel in an event of data quality problems, data flow problems, or other questions about data formats, etc., that may arise.  
B.  	A system that will be very reliable providing data (i.e. 99.9% data availability per year).  The high uptime (i.e. 99.9%) is required to ensure that data is available during significant weather events (e.g. land falling hurricanes, severe weather outbreaks such as May 3, 1999, November 15, 2005).  The offeror needs to demonstrate its system design to satisfy this requirement.  The offeror needs to describe its design safety factor and how these service levels are derived.  A description of the offerors worst-case scenario and their contingencies/responses, and what the government’s responsibilities are in these events should be given.  The description should include both the system/s located at the government facilities, communications systems, systems at the offerors facilities, and how the offeror obtains radar data.  In the event of a system failure at a Government site, it should be able to be quickly repaired, on site, with Government technicians swapping components until the problem is solved.  If the primary data acquisition source is down (e.g. satellite data ingest at a Government site), a backup data acquisition source shall be functional and available to Government personnel to activate in an event of a primary data source outage of greater than 30 minutes.  This activation may involve Government computers accessing a contractor’s server (e.g. FTP over the Internet) at the contractor’s site.  Note, the above service level of data availability does not apply to level-II radar data since the level-II radar data is not yet disseminated over an operational system.

The system at the Government site should have built-in scripts in place to access the contractor’s servers during a backup mode.  For example, to obtain data if a satellite is not available or the local satellite dish is damaged and not allowing the signal to be received.

The system at the Government sites shall provide dual copper gigabit Ethernet interfaces ( 1000 BaseT) for Government Local Area Network (LAN) / Private LAN connection.

The system at the Government sites shall provide Network File System (NFS) version 3 and http access to allow Government computers access to the system to obtain radar data.

The offer should include an example report on how the contractor measures data/service availability.  The contractor shall provide quarterly reports on data/service availability to the COTR during the life of the contract.

The contractor should certify and approve within 72 hours (beginning during regularly scheduled business hours) all vendor operating system patches and distribute any contractor updates within the same time period to the Government sites and designated Government contacts.  This includes testing and ensuring patches do not degrade the performance of the system.  The patch information will also be provided to/through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and to Government personnel at each site involved with information security who requests such data.

Data Availability: A system capable of acquiring:

-ALL standard, unaltered WSR-88D Product Data in real time

-high resolution, national-scale mosaics of reflectivity and other value-added    
             mosaics.

The offeror needs to document how long it takes (i.e. delay) radar data to flow through the contractor’s entire system until it is available for display and use at a Government Service Center, as well as how long the system takes to generate the various mosaic images and the timeliness of the mosaic images.  

E.	An application display on a contractor computer system will allow a forecaster to select products from WSR-88D sites, or mosaics, stored on the contractors server system (e.g. contractor user application software).

A display will allow a forecaster to select the WSR-88D sites or products to be acquired by the system.

F.	A system that is capable of acting as a server for making acquired data sets 
            available to Government systems via each Center's Local Area Network (LAN) 
            utilizing TCP/IP protocol (Ethernet). 

G.	The ability of a system to provide real time Product Arrival Notification (e.g. event driven notification system) over the TCP/IP Local Area Network (e.g. port)  to facilitate the timely distribution of radar data to other Government systems.

H.	Two (2) complete sets of operational manuals available at each site.  Manuals shall specify all setup functions necessary to operate the system, and any routine procedures required by the system.  Manuals shall include trouble-shooting procedures to speed up solutions to common problems.  Operational manuals shall include basic theory of operations, program logic flow, file structure descriptions, program documentation, development procedures and trouble shooting procedures.  Documentation on the system shall also include a block diagram of the hardware involved (e.g. from a feed horn all the way to the workstation).  The information shall also include all frequencies from the RF (i.e. Radio Frequency) side down to the IF (i.e. Intermediate Frequency).

RADAR DATA REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS

A.	The Contractor shall supply a wide variety of mosaic reflectivity data products to participating Centers.  Three different geographical mosaic areas are required: a mosaic of radar imagery across the lower 48 contiguous United States, a mosaic of radar imagery across Hawaii, and a mosaic of radar imagery across Alaska.           

 B.	Other required WSR-88D National Composite Mosaic Products shall include the following, again three different geographical mosaic areas are required (lower 48 states, Hawaii, and Alaska)

C.	The contractor shall supply unaltered WSR-88D product data to participating Centers with the following specifications when WSR-88D units are in Precipitation Mode.  Note, WMO HEADER and RPG HEADER are listed for each product below.

<ARCHDATE>10152006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, John Southerland, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3416
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to provide histological analysis of parvalbumin immunostaining at two ages in response to graded levels of thyroid hormone disruption induced by propylthiouracil.  Identification of the neurological consequences of mild perturbations of thyroid hormone function during pregnancy and early postnatal life is of critical importance to the Agency. It is clear that severe reductions in thyroid hormone induce neurological deficits, but it is not known if more subtle changes in neurological function  induced by modest perturbations in hormonal status are reflected in structural abnormalities.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis.  Dr. Jeffery Goodman is a neuroanatomist with extensive experience in immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus.  He is highly familiar with this  particular project and has worked extensively on this project in the past.  As the current project represents an extension from previous work, it is essential that identical neuroanatomical procedures are utilized.  Any other contractor would be required, at a minimum, to become familiar with all  of the research conducted to date on this project so as to begin to develop  neuroanatomical procedures identical to those implemented from previous work.  Utilizing any other contractor would be costly, delay research, and admit the possibility of basic misunderstanding and error.   NAICS Code  541710 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely  submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA,  Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

SUBPART 5301.91 -- OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose.
The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to consider concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight, and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. 
5301.9102 Policy.
(a) MAJCOM and DRU commanders shall appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their MAJCOM/DRU. For AFMC and AFSPC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. 
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g. administrative support, independent review teams). 
(c) Contracting officers shall identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP. 
(d) The ombudsman shall: 
(1) Act neutrally to facilitate resolution of issues or concerns raised by concerned parties; 
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the concerned party, and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority); 
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the commander, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; for AFMC and AFSPC centers, report only to the Center Commander, Laboratory Commander, or PEO; and for other MAJCOM/DRUS, report only to the MAJCOM CC or PEO;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of $2,500, consistent with the procedures in the contract; 
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by concerned parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes. 
(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, or those having Air Force wide implications. 
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts.
*****
5305.207 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopsis 

(20) In all synopsis announcing competitive or sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer shall indicate that the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable.
*****
5316.505 Ordering. (Deleted)
*****
5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. 

As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: 
OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
(End of clause)

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement to procure TC-150M Multi-Band amplifiers on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than Full and Open Competition in 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The required items will be procured on a Firm-Fixed Price basis via a new procurement modification to contract N00421-06-D-0026.  This modification will increase the minimum quantity by 51 and will have a maximum quantity of 200 to be ordered during the ordering periods.  As a result of this modification the ordering period for this equipment will be extended to 31 December 2008.  The intended source is Talla-Com Industries located in Tallahassee, FL. Talla-Com is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the required amplifiers. These amplifiers are required for integration into the Joint Base Station (JBS) System that has been designed around the Talla-Com amplifier, as it was the only design able to meet all of the JBS System requirements at the time of the initial design. An industry review did not reveal any other products capable of meeting all of the Government’s requirements. Procuring amplifiers from an alternate source would cause the Government to incur costs associate with: nonrecurring engineering (NRE) to modify the current design of the JBS systems, labor and materials to build new mounts to replace the existing ones, test and validate the functionality of the alternative solution with the JBS systems, and logistics support to design new cases and drawings, recreate user documentation, revise training packages, and Configuration Management (CM) over a ten (10) year life cycle for these systems. For these reasons, only the TC-150M Multi-Band amplifiers are capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements. This procurement is not set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees. The reference number for this notice is N00421-06-T-0113. All inquiries should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Susan Supplee, via e-mail susan.supplee@navy.mil or via telephone at (301) 995-8899.  Interested parties may submit capability statements, by 15:30 Eastern Standard Time on 29 August 2006, via fax to (301) 995-8670 or via email to susan.supplee@navy.mil.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Office of Cancer Survivorship (OCS),  plans to procure on a sole source basis services (Planning, Production and follow-up costs to include live presentations, telephone replays, web archiving, and post-workshop follow-up for the three-part teleconference series) for the Cancer Survivorship Teleconference Series from CancerCare, Inc., 275 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001. Cancer, for increasing numbers has become a curable illness and for most, a controllable disease. However, it is becoming rapidly apparent that few  modern therapies are benign. The chronic and late effects of cancer and its treatment can range from mild and transient problems, to serious and at times fatal conditions, and affect all aspects of function: physical, functional, emotional, social, and economic. Over the past decade, CancerCare, Inc. has pioneered educational teleconferences as a means of extending the capacity or ‘reach’ of efforts to communicate important health information. CancerCare’s Telephone Education Workshops have become a highly effective method through which to disseminate information about cancer to as broad an audience as possible – immediately overcoming barriers created by distance, physical disability, and geographic isolation. The CancerCare organization offers approximately 70 to 75 cancer-related educational teleconference programs each year. Based on its 15-year history of producing successful educational cancer-related teleconferences the proposed recipient of the award, CancerCare, initiated and produced the ‘Cancer Survivorship: Living with, Through, and Beyond Cancer’ teleconference series focused on post-treatment issues for cancer survivors and their families and caregivers. CancerCare, along with its partners, conducted the first three part series in spring of 2003 and additional series in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Currently, CancerCare, is the exclusive coordinator of the CancerCare: Cancer survivorship teleconference series. CancerCare’s mailing list, comprised of over 15,000 names, represents one of the largest resources for providing targeted outreach to cancer survivors and their families and healthcare professionals interested in education related to cancer survivorship.  In addition, they have a highly trained staff of social workers, skilled at moderating these programs and addressing the concerns of teleconference participants, as needed. CancerCare is the only known organization to the NCI Researcher that can provide the required services as detailed above.  This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 p.m. EDT, on August 28, 2006. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a firm-fixed-price Purchase Order on a sole source basis for the development of a portable instrument for biodetection to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County(UMBC).

UMBC will support the timely and cost-effective development of an optical system and engineering aspects for a portable "lab on a chip" that is designed to asses potency and neutralization of botulinum neurotoxins and measure biomolecules. UMBC is the only entity with the required technical expertise in electro-optical engineering that is located sufficiently close to FDA facilities to enable the effective movement of researchers and equipment between contractor and FDA facilities.  UMBC has also worked with FDA scientists to develop key elements of the project, and engaging another contractor would result in duplicative costs and slow the development of the product.

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ) is available. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes that it is capable of providing the required services may submit a statement of capability within seven (7) calendar days following the appearance of this notice.  A determination to compete this procurement on the basis of a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and may be sent to jennifer.fagan@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis for a Plethysmograph to Buxco Research Systems, Wilmington, North Carolina.  Buxco Research Systems holds a U.S. patent on the whole body plethysmograph and is the sole source of this system. The vendor is the exclusive supplier of both the instrumentation and software required to operate the instrument.

The whole body flow plethysmograph is a system that allows various components of airway function to be measured in small animals, including respiratory rates, airway compliance and airway resistance. This system will therefore allow us to measure changes in airway function following exposure to respiratory pathogens or allergens. We have demonstrated that respiratory rates measured using this system provides an excellent way to measure disease severity induced or exacerbated by respiratory viruses, including influenza. 
 
This system is unique is that it allows measurements to be made in live animals without anesthesia, so that we are able to follow pathogenesis and resolution of disease, using the same individual animals over the course of infection.  Measurement of respiratory rate in the small animal model are easily made using the whole body plethysmograph and is an essential parameter to include to further our understanding of vaccine and drug efficacy. 

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the seventh (7th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC), Mt. Weather, VA 20135-2006, intends to negotiate with Communications Laboratories, Inc., for the procurement and assembly of new National Warning System equipment, and maintain, repair and refurbish existing Government-owned terminal equipment for the National Warning System.  The existing National Warning System (NAWAS) consists of 61 separate multipoint private line systems, one for each of the 50 states, one for each of the ten FEMA regions, and one overall control circuit.  Each of these circuits normally functions on a self-contained basis, but any combination of, or all of the circuits can be linked to transmit national warning messages.  The average number of drops on the most utilized state circuits is 36, ranging from a low of 6 and a high of 96.  All locations are linked to NORAD through the National and Alternate Warning Centers.  The majority of NAWAS locations are in dispersed, rural locations, and local telephone companies provide most of the over 1,800 circuit links.  Although NAWAS circuits are leased, the actual equipment is government-owned.  The government-owned equipment provides all the network signaling and governs all circuit configurations and warning signaling using the voice channel to carry all transmissions.  
The Government will ship the items to the Contractor manufacturing site for repair or refurbishment.  The Contractor shall repair and ship the equipment back to FEMA within 14 working days of receipt of the equipment.  The Government may require the Contractor to assemble, repair or refurbish any of the following types of NAWAS terminal equipment:  Model 207, Model 208, Model 209, Model 212, Model 204, Model 205, and Model 210.  This National Warning System requirement is considered to be a non-commercial service.  Interested persons may respond by identifying their capability to provide the required service, to include descriptive literature for their proposed service AND pricing.  Responses shall be in writing and sent to the address identified above, ATTN:  Mrs. Debi Foster, or facsimile to 540/542-2631, same ATTN line, or email at the address shown at the conclusion of this announcement.  Responses must be received 15 calendar days from date of publication of this announcement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the date identified above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the “Bureau”) intends to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to help the Bureau transition from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) system to the Dynamics of Economic Well-Being System (DEWS). Comprehensive information about individual and household income and program participation collected by the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is used by federal agencies to evaluate programs and assess need.  A major use of the SIPP has been to evaluate the effectiveness of government programs and to analyze the impact of options for modifying them.  

The re-engineered system, to be known as the dynamics of economic well-being system (DEWS), is expected to reduce respondent burden and attrition and deliver data on a timely basis.  Although the DEWS will not supply the same level of detail as the SIPP, its design must offer policymakers and researchers data that address the same basic issues.  Several options are now being considered for a new system. In order to accomplish this, NAS will convene a panel of experts to evaluate the costs and benefits of strategies for data linkage, determine the accessibility of relevant administrative records, determine the operational feasibility of linking administrative records and survey data, evaluate the quality and usefulness of the linked data, and develop strategies for providing public access to the linked data while protecting the confidentiality of individual respondents. The panel will also consider the implications for the survey component of the new system of linked data with regard to sample size, design and frequency, and content of the interviews. The proposed contract will be for a base period of twenty-one (21) months.  

Interested firms should identify their capability to provide the necessary services as described above. The written response must include detail information relating to the specific service being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of ones ability to provide the necessary services will not be considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals nor is a Request-for-Proposal solicitation document currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, the Bureau intends to request a proposal from NAS on a noncompetitive basis for the work described. Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the “Bureau”) intends to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to help the office of Decennial Management define research to be conducted in the 2010 Census and provide recommendations for best methodological strategies. The NAS also will recommend research and testing for the early 2020 test cycle. The Census Bureau conducts a formal evaluation and experimental program in conjunction with each decennial census to assist in evaluating the current census and in building the foundation for making early and informed decisions about the role and scope of post censuses. The Census 2000 program formed the basis for planning, testing, experimentation, and evaluation activities for the 2010 Census.  It measured the effectiveness and impact on data quality of the Census 2000 design, operations, systems, and processes.  The success of the Census 2000 program can be measured from the findings of more than 100 tests, experiments, and evaluations, 15 topic reports, and 4 synthesis reports.  The research findings provided information on the value of new or different methodologies and recommendations for planning the 2010 Census. The Census Bureau requires NAS to convene a panel of experts to review the proposed 2010 research topics and high-level research questions, suggest additional topics and questions as needed, and suggest priorities for the research topics and high-level research questions.  Additionally, the panel will review the Census Bureau’s proposed methods for conducting evaluations and experiments for the 2010 Census, and recommend improved or new methods, as appropriate. Also, the Census Bureau requires the panel to consider what can be learned from the 2010 testing cycle conducted in 2003 – 2006 to better plan testing for the 2020 Census.  A review of the design, methods, and results from tests, evaluations and experiments conducted in advance of 2010 will inform 2020 planning.  The proposed contract will be for a base period of thirty-six (36) calendar months with two (2) renewable, twelve (12) calendar month option periods.

<DESC>Offerors:
Please be advised that the appropriate NAICS Code for this requirement is 541511 – Custom Computer Programming Services.

The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA) anticipates the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Information Technology (IT) vendor community in September 2006 for a wholly outsourced, turnkey IT system to be designed, developed, and operated by a private sector vendor under contract to the DOL. The purpose of the IT system, known as EFAST2, is to receive, process, store, publicly disclose, distribute, and archive approximately 1.1 million electronically filed Form 5500 Series filings submitted annually by the public over the Internet. Form 5500 Series filings (including Form 5500 and all schedules and attachments to these forms) are annual information returns that contain information on employee benefits plans, including both pension and welfare plans, and are required to be filed annually by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Form 5500 Series filings may contain Sensitive Tax Information and are therefore subject to commensurate security and handling protections. EFAST2 will allow filers to electronically file Form 5500 Series filings via a secure web portal. The Form 5500 Series electronic filings to be processed include structured data associated with forms and schedules, and unstructured data associated with attachments contained in PDF and text files. 

The Department requires this system to support a new mandate of electronic filing of Form 5500 Series filings, per the final regulation published in the Federal Register July 21, 2006. At this time, the Department estimates that the period of performance for this effort will run from contract award through December 31, 2008 for Base Period (Prototype Development and Production Scale-up), August 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 for Option Period I (1st Component) (Advance Customer Support Activities), and January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2019 for Option Period I (2nd Component) through XI (Operations). 

EBSA anticipates seeking responsive proposals on the EFAST2 RFP (RFP DOL069RP20266) from firms that are capable of performing the work described in the RFP, which can be summarized as follows: 1) Designing, developing, hosting, and maintaining a secure, scaleable web portal that allows users to electronically file Form 5500 Series filings; 2) Providing a system based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) allowing filers to submit filings directly through the website or via approved third party software; 3) Checking all filings for accuracy and completeness using XML schema validation and edit tests, and quickly returning acceptance/rejection messages to the filer via email; 4) Allowing stakeholders such as plan administrators, plan transmitters, and software developers to electronically register and attain electronic filing credentials. The system will verify these credentials upon receipt of each filing; 5) Providing a public disclosure website that allows the public, Government, and vendor contact center staff to access, view, and download filing facsimiles over the Internet; 6) Providing a contact center and related customer support features to filers, software developers, and other stakeholders interfacing with the system; 7) Providing support to third party software developers that develop electronic filing software with which filers may complete, validate, and submit filings electronically. This support would include electronic filing technical specifications, technical support, testing, certification, and other ongoing support; 8) Managing all IT and related telecommunications equipment associated with the web portal; 9) Establishing and maintaining all required security on the portal based on varying degrees of access control and authorization, as well as physical, personnel, administrative, and computer security for the filing data, processing facility, and staff, including supporting Government conduct of a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) for each assigned staff member; 10) Establishing an end-to-end tracking function that records the processing history and current status of all filing submissions received; and, 11) Meeting or exceeding the contractually specified timeliness and accuracy performance standards specified in the solicitation.

This solicitation will be available on or after September 1, 2006, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Reference should be made to the issued RFP DOL069RP20266 for additional information on the contractual terms and conditions, performance standards, functional, security, and other related requirements.  Responsive proposals shall be requested and delivered to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the Technical and Business Proposal Instructions specified in Section L of RFP DOL069RP20266.

<CONTACT>MARILYN J. HUTCHISON PURCHASING AGENT 3032369321     mhutchi@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory, has approximately four million seismogram images from the World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) stored on 70 mm film chips.  The USGS has a requirement to scan approximately 50,000 of the film chips at high resolution in order to make the seismograms computer accessible.  Each film chip is 70 mm wide and approximately 123 mm long. Each chip contains one image of a WWSSN short period or long period seismogram. Each film chip also contains a 16-digit numerical code corresponding to seismograph station identification number, date, time, and channel identifier.  The requirement is to scan the seismogram images on the film chips, using gray scale scanning (NOT bi-tonal), at a resolution equivalent to scanning the original 910 mm x 300 mm paper seismogram at 400 dpi. This means that the film chip image itself must be scanned at 3200 dpi or better, in order to achieve the highest image resolution possible.  The images shall be stored as high resolution compressed jpeg images with visual resolution equivalent to an uncompressed tiff image. Images shall be stored on DVDs.  The USGS will require two copies of each DVD.  Ronsin Imaging has previously provided high resolution scanning of these film chips for the USGS.  It is necessary to achieve the highest consistency in all of the scanned images at the same resolution as described above.  Based on this information and other information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Ronsin Imaging, 215 S. Lemon Creek Drive, Walnut, California, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command seeks to identify potential small business sources for the design, development, integration and testing of a Common Avionics Display (CAD).  The CAD program will look to begin a family of displays that employ open architecture principles to optimize commonality across the Naval Enterprise and make best use of open commercial standards and modularity.  This includes both fixed and rotary wing aircraft cockpits.  Potential platforms include UH-1Y, AH-1Z and MV-22.  Initial design, development, integration and testing will be for a 6”X8” non-processing (dumb) display and another non-processing display size TBD.  The contract will have options for the development of a smart display for the 6”X8” and/or other size TBD.  The government intends to award a cost plus incentive fee type contract.  Contract performance for the design, development, integration and testing of the initial displays and option displays will be for a period of three years after contract award.  

More information about the CAD program can be found on the NAVAIR Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) website at http://pma209.navair.navy.mil/teams/missionsystems/ccs/home.asp.  Please address all technical questions concerning CAD to CDR Mac McGovern at 301-757-6764 or Gary Daelemans at 301-757-6766.

Interested qualified small businesses shall demonstrate the capability to design, develop, integrate, test and produce both a dumb and smart common avionics display by providing a Statement of Capability (SOC) on company letterhead, not to exceed three pages in length.  At a minimum the SOC shall address the following areas.  

1)  Capability and experiencing in designing, developing, integrating, testing and producing displays similar in nature to those described above;
2)  Financial capability to design, develop, integrate, test and manufacture avionic or similar displays;
3)  Experience in meeting cost, schedule and performance goals.

SOCs must be delivered electronically by 4:00PM EST on 2 June 2006 to the following email address:  janine.stratakes@navy.mil.  Proprietary information must be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.  This synopsis is issued for the purpose of determining small business interest, feasibility and capability and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis. Data will not be returned. This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract. This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately in FEDBIZOPS.

<DESC>This announcement is a follow-up to Sources Sought Notice entitled “Sources Sought for Common Avionics Display (CAD) Development” posted on 19 May 2006 under Solicitation Number “Reference ce Number-CAD-Sources Sought”.  Accordingly, the Naval Air Systems Command recently sought technical capability statements from small business sources for the design, development, integration and testing of a Common Avionics Display (CAD).  The intent of the sources sought request was to determine if there was an adequate technical base in the industry to run a competition set aside strictly for small businesses. 

After a thorough review of the small business company submittals, the U.S. Navy has concluded that small business set-aside competition would not be in the best interest of the Government for the CAD requirement.  It was determined that a small business set-aside would be an approach that would burden the Government with unacceptable risk.  A draft Statement Of Objectives (SOO) will be available to all of industry for comment pending approval release.  Please address all technical questions concerning CAD to CDR. Mac McGovern at (301) 757-6764 or Mr. Gary Daelemans at (301) 757-6766.

Please reference VA-786A-06-RI-0097 as the subject of your response.  Public Law 106-50, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 established a statutory Government-wide goal that 3 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be spent with SDVOSBs. In an effort to enhance opportunities for SDVOSBs and increase the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplishments in this important socioeconomic category, VA's National Cemetery Administration is performing preliminary market research to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of SDVOSBs with regards to an upcoming acquisition for Construction Services at the Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville NY.  The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for SDVOSBs, pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.5. NAICS code for this acquisition is 237990.  The Size Standard is $31.0 Million.  The magnitude of this project is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. Project is subject to the availability of funds.

NOTE(S): 1. Bids will include alternate deducts that are sequenced as per NCA priority, and are cumulative.  Refer to bid documents for instructions. REQUIRED RESPONSES:  Your review of this information and response to the following questions will be very helpful in determining if this acquisition may be set-aside exclusively for competition among SDVOSBs.  Please review the specifications and technical requirements carefully before responding to this e-mail.  If the question is not applicable, please indicate "N/A" in your reply to that question: (1)  Has your firm, as a prime contractor, whether individually or through a formal joint venture or teaming agreement, or under subcontract to a prime contractor, provided construction services for projects of similar size and scope (Government or commercial) within the last three years as described in the brief description of project above?  If yes, please provide the following information on your three most recent projects: (a) Contracting Agency Address &amp; contracting officer's name and telephone number. 	(b) Contract Number, date and amount of award, date of completion 	(c) Description of Items/Services provided under the contract. 	(d) If any bonding was provided, what was the amount of bonding?

(f) State whether or not there were any performance issues under the contract which resulted in the issuance of a Cure Notice or Show Cause Notice by the contracting officer. (2)  In order to determine if an acquisition can be set-aside for SDVOSBs, the contracting officer must determine that there are a sufficient number of SDVOSBs capable of performing the contract requirement and that award can be made at a reasonable, fair market price.  To that end, please provide your firm's individual and aggregate contract bonding capacity. (3)  Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.?  If so, please provide the specifics. (4)  Has your firm, or any firm that you would potentially joint venture or team with for a large acquisition of construction services or for any acquisition, ever bid on a Federal acquisition and been determined non-responsible by the contracting officer and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) failed to issue a Certificate of Competency (COC) to your firm or teaming partners when the matter was referred to SBA for review and consideration? Please e-mail your responses and any relevant information regarding specific performance or other qualifications regarding the construction services requested, no later than September 1, 2006, to Michael Hannum at michael.hannum@mail.va.gov.   Do not send hard copy advertising or promotional materials.  Please ensure that all responses are comprehensive and provide a name and point-of-contact for your firm for follow-up by this office or the procuring contracting officer. If you have responded to any previous e-mail messages or had other communications with our office regarding preliminary market research for this construction project, please be advised that it will be necessary for you to respond to this e-mail and the questions contained therein.

<DESC>The U.S. Army ARDEC is interested in acquiring information on commercially available tripods to ground mount the M2 .50 caliber and MK19 heavy machine guns.  This includes the traverse and elevation (T&E) mechanism and applicable carriage and cradle system (or pintle).  The goal of this survey is to identify lightweight tripods for heavy machine guns with the potential to replace the current M3 Tripod with possible future procurements as modified non- developmental item (NDI). Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to:  weight, collapsed dimensions, deployed width, deployed height, operation with Mission Oriented  Protective Posture (MOPP) and cold weather clothing, Into Action Time (ease of deployment and stow), corrosion resistance, adverse environmental conditions, and chemical resistance.  The lightweight tripod should weigh considerably less than 44 lbs; the current weight of the M3 Tripod.   Performance requirements  shall be equal to or better than the current M3 Tripod and T&E mechanism and not interfere or degrade the performance of the M2 or MK19 machine guns. (e.g. modular design, no special tools, easily repairable, low/no maintenance).  The mounting systems are desired to be rugged and highly reliable, maximizing weapon elevation/depression/traverse while minimizing potential safety issues. It is further desired that any new mounting configuration be compatible with existing weapon systems and ancillary equipment, including ammunition  containers and attached sighting/targeting devices.  Interested parties are invited to indicate their interest by providing some or all of the following: specifications, brochures, manuals, demonstration videos, and identification of current customers.  In addition companies are encouraged, but not required to submit one (1) tripod bid sample to be used for market survey purposes only; an end use certificate will not be provided.  Submission of sample hardware will confirm to the Government the immediate availability of hardware.  All information or samples are to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government. Hardware samples will be returned no later than 180 days upon receipt at no cost to the Government; sample hardware will be returned as tested samples. The above information and / or bid samples should be sent within 30 days of this announcement to:  Department of the Army, U.S. Army ARDEC, AMSRD-AAR-AEW-M(D), Bldg 7, ATTN:  Mr. Anthony Cautero, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000. This is a Market Survey for information purposes only, and not a pre- solicitation notice, nor a request for proposals.  If a formal requirement is generated at a later date, a pre-solicitation notice will be published. All comments or questions in response to this market survey due no later than 12 September 2006.

<SUBJECT>B -- Geospatial Intelligence Support- Notice of Intent to Issue Modification Against Existing Contract
<DESC>Customs and Border Protection, Office of Border Patrol (OBP), 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC intends to negotiate directly with the contractor, INDUS Corporation, for purposes of modifying the current contract to add additional work considered within the scope of the contract.  This sole source action is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is not a request for proposals. 

It is the Government’s belief that INDUS has unique extensive institutional knowledge of GIS applications and analysis specific to OBP. This includes knowledge of immigration laws and application of these laws to geospatial analysis, knowledge of OBP enforcement applications and the linkage of these applications to OBP spatial databases, knowledge of OBP policies and procedures as they relate to geospatial collection and analysis, and knowledge of multiple program areas served by OBP GIS.    

Additional labor hours will be added to the original contract for Geospatial Intelligence Services (includes cartographic publishing; technology assessment; technical support; on-line data acquisition, preparation, and integration; development and administration of standards for geospatial data with OBP and CBP).  OBP has an immediate need for an increase in GIS support, and due to INDUS Corporation’s unique knowledge of OBP they are the only vendor that can meet the delivery schedule for this mission-critical support.

The need for additional work has arose due to various unforeseen circumstances and includes, but is not limited to: the formation of the SBI.net program office; Operation Jumpstart (the direct support OBP by the National Guard), and the DHS Enterprise License Agreement for Geospatial Software.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  Email your questions to CBP Contract Specialist Jason Whetsell at jason.scott.whetsell@dhs.gov.

Each craft will be equipped with the ruggedized next-generation computer system that will provide navigational and situational awareness functions as well as a variety of sub-system interfaces.  In addition, the Government requires logistics support and sustaining engineering for the ruggedized computer systems after they are integrated and installed in the craft.  Integration and installation of the replacement computers are not part of this contracting action.  The ruggedized computer system must be able to meet all of the current user defined performance and operational requirements defined for use specifically on the MK V SOC.   

The replacement MK V SOC computer system’s processor must have TRANSAS Marine software compatibility.  The system will also include the following specific minimum features/characteristics:

•	Intel P4 2.0/2.4 GHz processor
•	1GB DDRAM
•	64MB 4x AGP graphics card
•	Rugged solid state removable hard drive (4GB Flash; up to 40GB)
•	3.5” floppy drive

•	1 NMEA output (talker channel)
•	Interface ports and interface software for MK V SOC sub-systems including the MTU engines, Global Positioning System, compass, LST-5D / PSC-5 SATCOM, radar overlay, Maritime Forward Looking Infrared (MARFLIR) system, and depth sounder
•	10.4” Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitor with the following features: daylight readable, dim capability, ruggedized components, and include mounting features as required. 
•	The keyboard will be ruggedized and include an integral mouse and backlit keys.  
•	M38999-Series III connectors
•	Appropriate mounting features.  
•	All computer system components have been ruggedized to withstand the harsh marine environment, including severe shock and vibration, high humidity, salt spray, and temperature extremes, encountered while operating on the MK V SOC.
•	The replacement computer system shall be a form and fit replacement for the current MKV SOC computer system.

The Government intends to include next generation computers for the follow-on MK V SOC craft but not as part of this procurement effort.

Any questions/responses regarding the above requirements should be submitted via email to Ms. Sandra Smith at smiths1@socom.mil. Note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>84 -- Request For Information (RFI) - AF Heritage Coat Program
<DESC>AF Heritage Coat RFI
RESPONSES TO THIS RFI 
ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CS, 22 August 2006

Request for Information (RFI): The Government will not compensate any interested party, firm, or individual that may choose to provide a response to this RFI.  An appropriate Request for Proposal (RFP) process may follow if funding is provided.

Purpose: The purpose of the Heritage Coat Program is to develop a new Service Dress coat for Air Force personnel that will embody the “Heritage to Horizon” motto of honoring the Air Force’s past even as it meets the future.  The Air Force Clothing Office has been tasked to lead this effort. To meet the initial program objectives, we are seeking Professional Uniform Design/Concepts in the form of Drawings/Sketches and story boards.  These designs are required to capture a professional appearance which communicates the Air Force’s rich military heritage as well as foster the feelings of pride, dignity, and honor associated with that heritage in the individual wearing the uniform.  Emphasis is placed on a professional military looking appearance.

Note that two drawings for each concept is required—one for females and one for males.

To aid in the design effort, three pictures are attached.  One is Gen Billy Mitchell of WWI and one is Gen Hap Arnold of WWII—these capture two of the past coats.  One is of the current AF Service Dress Coat.

The current service dress coat is blue and the fabric is a polyester/wool blend. Trims and other colors are encouraged to be used in the designs.  Alternate fabrics and colors will be given full consideration.  The coat designs may be belted.  

*The Air Force Clothing Office will be hosting an “Industry Day” tentatively set for 29 August 2006 at Wright Patterson AFB, OH.

Upon design determination, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued for prototypes and possibly test garments.  The Air Force Chief of Staff, through the Air Force Uniform Board, will be the final approval authority for any new uniform design.  

Any and all resources may be used to develop the coat at the designer’s discretion.  Information may be gathered by any means.  Designers are encouraged to develop/bring more than one design to Industry Day.  

 Industry Day

*Industry Day is tentatively schedule to be held on 29 August 2006 at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Please submit replies and contact information by the suspense date of 22 August 2006 to:

The Department of Health and Human Services is pleased to announce the upcoming HHS BioShield Stakeholders Workshop. The goals of the HHS BioShield Stakeholders Workshop are:  

1.To provide its attendees with insight into the current BioShield interagency governance process; and
2.To provide individual stakeholders with an opportunity to help guide the future implementation of Project BioShield by providing input into the draft Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures (PHEMC) Strategy for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Threats. 
   
The draft PHEMC Strategy for CBRN Threats is being developed under the leadership of the Office of Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures (OPHEMC) within the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and will be published in the Federal Register prior to this workshop. This Strategy will define the principles guiding HHS medical countermeasure research, development and acquisition. 
 
The BioShield Stakeholders Workshop will be an open meeting for representatives from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, professional societies, state and local public health organizations, the academic research and development community, public interest groups, stakeholder federal agencies, and Congress.

The BioShield Stakeholders Workshop is being convened, and the PHEMC Strategy for CBRN Threats is being developed and published to fulfill the promise that Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O. Leavitt made on March 16, 2006, in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. During his testimony, Secretary Leavitt pledged to:

"work closely with other departments and agencies to streamline and make more effective the current BioShield interagency governance process.

No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 7 days from the date of publication of this announcement.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
RFP HSCG84-06-R-AAT136
THIS IS PART A OF A TWO PART COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  PART B IS AVAILABLE UNDER RFP HSCG84-06-R-AAT136-B.  DOCUMENT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS DUE TO LENGTH.

HSCG848-06-R-AAT136-A

(1)  INTRODUCTION:  This is of a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request For Proposal (RFP) number HSCG84-06-R-AAT136 is assigned for tracking purposes only. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08. The U.S. Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract for the purchase of Portable Side Scan Sonar Systems. The U.S. Coast Guard anticipates purchasing multiple units over a 10 year period, the number of units will change to meet requirements at that time. The U.S. Coast Guard has an operational requirement to recover sunken or damaged Aids to Navigation, and utilizes WLM 175’ and WLB 225’ Buoy Tenders to recover sunken buoys. The most time effective search method for locating sunken buoys is to use a sonar system to scan large areas of terrain. The original hull mounted system installed when the Buoy Tenders were constructed has been discontinued, making servicing and parts increasingly difficult. A hull mounted system requires costly drydock periods to service the transducers, therefore the Coast Guard desires a portable, towable array side scan sonar system that will lower maintenance costs. Unlike the previous systems installed, the new system should be user friendly to operate and provide clear, high resolution, easily interpretable images of the areas scanned. It is therefore desired for the operation of the system to be done through a GUI (Graphical User Interface), such as through the Microsoft Windows Operating System. Since the sonar system may not be used on regular intervals, the system should require little or no regular maintenance when not in use. The system should be capable of easy and quick troubleshooting by minimally trained operators. In order to keep the capability of viewing and controlling sonar returns from the bridge, the system will have connection points on the bridge and buoy deck with interconnecting shipboard cable to connect the portable system together. Additionally, the Coast Guard desires a system that will be supported by the equipment manufacturer in it’s present configuration for a period of time not less than 10 years. Due to weight and space limitations, the system should be easily stored aboard the Coast Guard’s buoy tenders, and be easily lifted by one crewmember. All products offered including items in the Parts Kits or individual components must be new. Used or Refurbished Items/Parts are not acceptable.


(2)  SCHEDULE OF SERVICES:  The following is the estimated number of Systems, Spares and Training Support anticipated over the 10 year period of this Requirements Contract. Please note this is an estimated number that does not bind the Coast Guard to commitment for Delivery Orders and quantities placed against the awarded contract.

HSCG848-06-R-AAT136-B

Continued from Part A:

   c.  Period for acceptance of offers.  Fill-in:  90 calendar days.  

52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

(i)	Technical Approach;
(ii)	Past Performance;
(iii)	Price

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, if all other factors are equal, price may be the determining factor.

The offeror’s proposal shall contain a response to each of the areas identified below.  Only those proposals prepared in accordance with the solicitation will be evaluated.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on three factors:

Technical Proposal/Factor 1:  (Most Important)  
(i)	Salient Characteristics.  The written technical proposal must contain sufficient descriptive information such as the Manufacturer, Make and Model Number and include salient characteristics, schematics and/or other technical drawings so the Government can determine the system offered meets or exceeds the Government’s minimum requirements.  	
(ii)	Parts Kit.  The technical proposal shall address the contents of the Parts Kits required by Paragraph  v.  If the offeror cannot provide a Parts Kit to the system being offered, the proposal shall provide an alternative means of obtaining spare parts, including a list of component parts and their price and availability supported by a commercial price list.  
(iii)	Training.  The technical proposal shall include a detailed description of the training package being offered. 
(iv)	Technical Support.  The proposal shall address the contractor’s approach to providing on-call/on-site technical support.
(v)	The proposal shall address the ability to provide additional operator and maintenance manuals.  

Past Performance/Factor 2:  (As Important as Technical Proposal) The proposal must contain the names of government or private corporation clients to whom they have provided the same system, including training and technical support, within the last three years.  

Price/Factor 3:   (Least Important)  The cost proposal shall contain supporting documentation of the price proposed such as a commercial price list in order to determine price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.  Although price is not the controlling factor in award of a contract under this solicitation; it is an important factor and should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of the equality of the proposals in terms of the other evaluation factors on which selection is based.  If competing proposals are substantially equal in technical and past performance, price may be the determining factor in award.

Exclusion of any of this information may cause the proposal to be excluded from consideration.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items (March 2005)
An offeror shall complete only paragraph (j) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-925, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $11.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to procure Microarray and Microarray Services for the NICHD Microarray Core Facility, from George Washington University c/o Yan A. Su.  

Scope of Work 
Microarray, Database and Bioinformatics for Gene Expression and Mutation Analyses
1.	Microarray, Database and Bioinformatics
Yan A. Su, Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Associate Director of Catherine Birch McCormick Genomics Center, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the George Washington University the School of Medicine has provided microarray, database, and bioinformatics services to the NICHD investigators for more than five years.  Below are resource and work-scope established in Dr. Su’s laboratory for NICHD investigators conducting microarray, database and bioinformatics analysis of mRNA and protein expression, gene amplification and deletion, DNA methylation, promoter DNA-protein interaction, regulatory micro-RNA expression, and gene mutation studies.  Dr. Su is responsible for maintaining his laboratory at the cutting edge in these fields, for developing resource, designing and fabricating microarrays for the NICHD investigators, and for developing, maintaining and updating algorithms, databases and bioinformatics tools for a large-scale analysis of gene expression and mutation in healthy and diseased cells.  In addition, Yan A. Su and his colleagues are available to assist the NICHD investigators in microarray data analysis and technical assistance upon requests.  The methods for the microarray technologies developed in Yan A. Su’s laboratory have been described in the recent publications1-4.

2.	E.coli DH5&#61474; strain, Plasmid and PCR DNA Clones Related to Human and Mouse Genes for Microarrays
      Clones are available to NICHD investigators:
40,000 cDNA clones of human genes were purchased from Invitrogen (previous Research Genetics, Inc).  The Contractor will update bi-monthly the gene names and descriptions corresponding to these clones based on Human Unigene database that is constantly updating as the Human Genome Project progresses.  All the clones were sequence-verified by Research Genetics and do not need further verification for their sequence identities.  Due to constant updates of Human Unigene database, it is recommend for researchers to verify the sequence and clone identities following the microarray identification of candidate genes.  
The NIA 15,000 and 7,400 mouse cDNA clones have been used to produce cDNA microarrays for the NICHD investigators.  The mouse gene lists and information are available to the NICHD investigators and have been deposited into the NICHD Gene Expression Server, which is available by contacting Stanley Hornyak, the Computer Support Services at the NICHD.  Gene lists and information will be sent to the investigators directly, upon requests.  For genes not present in the collection, the NICHD investigators will have to provide DNA clones for microarrays.  
9,000 CpG island DNA clones of human promoter sequences have been utilized to develop promoter DNA microarrays for the NICHD investigators to study transcription factor-promoter interactions, gene expression regulation, and DNA methylation on gene expression control, etc.
NIH-BMAP Non-Redundant 38,000 mouse ESTs (37,459 clones) generated by the Brain Molecular Anatomy Project (BMAP) which is a trans-NIH project aimed at understanding gene expression and function in the nervous system. BMAP has two major goals: (i) gene discovery: to catalog all of the genes expressed in the nervous system, under both normal and abnormal conditions.  (ii) Gene expression analysis: to monitor gene expression patterns in the nervous system as a function of cell type, anatomical location, developmental stage and physiological state, and thus gain insight into gene function.  In pursuit of these goals, M. Bento Soares has developed cDNA libraries from 10 regions of adult mouse brain, spinal cord, and retina.  From these libraries, over 50,000 EST clones have been sequenced and clustered.  The resulting 37,459 unique clones have been arrayed into the BMAP non-redundant collection.
NIH-BMAP Non-Redundant 12,000 mouse Retina ESTs (11,864 clones).  The mouse retina non-redundant set was generated for the NIH - University of Iowa Brain Molecular Anatomy Project: NIH-BMAP (M. Bento Soares, Thomas L. Cassavant, Val C. Sheffield). The clones in this set were chosen by applying the University of Iowa clustering method to sequences generated from Soares non-normalized, normalized, and serially subtracted cDNA libraries constructed from mouse neonatal, embryonic, and adult retina specific tissues. Tissues were provided by Dr. Xin-Yuan Fu, Yale School of Medicine.
Therefore, we have a total of 40,000 human genes, 9,000 human gene promoter clones, and 72,000 mouse genes for DNA microarrays.  Many of these clones have been used to designed and fabricate microarrays.  In this case, plasmid DNA and PCR products are available for fabrication of microarrays.
Clones are for gene mutations and/or polymorphisms:  
287 customized oligos have been designed, synthesized and printed on glass slides for simultaneous detection of multiple gene mutations and/or polymorphisms, as requested by the NICHD investigators.
Antibodies for protein microarrays:
10 antibodies against human proteins were purchased from commercial resource and have been used to develop protein microarrays, as approval of the principle study.  Upon requests by NICHD investigators and approval by the NICHD Scientific Director, the contractor will be able to design and fabricate microarrays with customized antibodies for research projects.

•	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, RNA molecules encoded in the genomes of plants and animals.  They are highly conserved, approximately 21-mer RNAs regulate the expression of genes by binding to the 3'-untraslated regions (3'-UTR) of specific mRNAs.  The mirVana miRNA probe set is a collection of 200 amine-modified DNA oligonucleotides complementary to every known human and mouse miRNA.  Using the miRNA microarrays, one can analyze global miRNA expression profiles.
Protein arrays with antibodies to human proteins:
•	Customized arrays with 10 antibodies;
The microarray images have deposited to the NICHD Gene Expression Server that demonstrate the quality of gene chips, that is, high signal intensities, low background signals, high signal to noise ratio, and broad distributions of signal intensities.
4.   Databases and Data Analysis for Profiling Gene Expression  
Equipped with expertise, computer and software, we assist in database construction and expression data analysis outlined in the following sections:
i)  Expression database for data analysis.  After obtaining a microarray image, the first step is to extract the expression ratio accurately.  A widely used expression intensity and ratio extraction technique 5 has been successfully employed in many of studies 6-8 including studies conducted in Dr. Su's laboratory 1,2.  Briefly, the expression data files contain bio-information including gene name, gene title, gene identification number, plate and array positions of genes, expression signal intensities, mean values, standard deviations, background intensities, signal to noise ratios, array qualities, hybridization qualities, expression ratios and calibrated ratios, and many others.  The individual expression data file is linked to a master database for each research project.  The master expression database is a relational database linked to the corresponding expression data files and unigene databases (human or mouse), and the public databases as well to facilitate high throughput analysis of gene expression.
ii) Computing algorithm and software.   The Contractor will develope a computing algorithm termed the local maximum clustering method that is applied for clustering analysis of microarray gene expression data.3  Based on this algorithm, the contractor  developed software "LocaMaxCluster" for automated clustering analysis of gene expression profiles.  In addition, we have developed computing tools including UniGDatabaseConverter v.l.0 and &#61498;ArrayDataMiner v1.0 to facilitate high-throughput analysis of gene expression.  
iii) Analysis of expression data.  To explore the similarity and dissimilarity between samples and genes, unsupervised and supervised clustering algorithms were applied 8,9.  Briefly, genes in each microarray experiment were first filtered according to their measurement quality.  After data filtering, standard hierarchical clustering algorithm 9 was applied and the clustering results were visualized by multidimensional scaling and dendrograms displaying techniques so as to give biologists intuitive information on relationship between samples and between genes.  Applying the clustering algorithm to all samples in the given experiments may reveal multiple relationships between the samples under study.  Clustering of genes based on their expression profiles will provide more hints for understanding of gene function and regulatory pathways.  Results derived from the clustering algorithm can be validated by random permutation of sample labeling and/or leave-one-out cross-validation.  The robustness of clustering results may be evaluated by adding additional noise into the data set and then observing the change of grouping effect.
iv) Development of new algorithms.  The Contractor developed hMitChip3, the third generation human mitochondria-focused gene chip4.  To efficiently analyze expression profiles of data generated by use of the gene chips, contractor also developed customized computing procedures for extracting informative gene expression data from raw data4.  The software is available to the NICHD investigators upon requests.  The contractor also developed mutation gene chips for the NICHD investigators and we are going to develop algorithms and software for the gene chips to facilitate automated data analysis.  
v)  Development of new database.  All gene chips developed in my laboratory are unique, of which availability of database would accelerate data analysis.  For example, contractor developed data files and database for hMitChip3 gene chips and database for hMitChip3 gene informatics to facilitate interpretation of microarray results4.   All databases are for analysis of microarray gene expression or mutation and will be available to the NICHD investigators upon requests.

5.   Available Database, algorithm and Software for Analysis of Gene Expression Data 
The computers, ScanArray microarray scanner and software (Microsoft Office, IPLab, FileMaker Pro, GeneSpring, Timbuktu Pro, MATLAB, ScanArray Express, and so on) have been provided by NICHD to Dr. Su’s laboratory.  These resources will be used to acquire microarray images, to generate GAL, GIPO, or related files, to perform microarray quality tests, to generate gene databases, gene expression databases and to conduct gene expression data analysis.  Because the equipment and procedures used in Dr. Su’s laboratory will be the same as those used in the NICHD and NCCAM laboratories, the variance from equipment and procedures will be minimized in order to increase the quality of the microarray data.  To facilitate gene expression data analysis, the following microarray related information is available to investigators:
(1)  As our collaboration proceeding, the PI will develop and archive the information on DNA clones, genes, array configuration, GAL files and Gipo files for all DNA microarrays onto the NICHD gene expression server to assist the NICHD investigators in their research projects.
(2)  The materials, methods, and references for DNA microarrays will be archived on the NICHD gene expression server for investigators preparing their publications.  In addition, upon requests, Dr. Su is available to offer training course to the NICHD investigators.  The training information will be available to those who have no chance to attend training. 
(3)  The information, templates, examples and quality controls for expression database and data analysis, along with brief instructions, were and will be stored onto the NICHD gene expression server to facilitate the research activities. 
(4)  Databases for microarray data analysis include:
•	Human unigene database
•	Human unigene and clone ID link
•	Human 46K gene database
•	Mouse unigene database
•	Mouse unigene and clone ID link
•	Mouse 30K gene database
•	Human mitochondria-focused microarray gene expression database
•	Human and mouse XY-encoded gene database
•	Human apoptosis, mitochondria and chromosome 6 gene expression database
•	Human apoptosis, mitochondria and chromosome 17 gene expression database
•	Human breast cancer gene expression profiling database
•	Master database and individual data files tailored for rapid adaptation to investigator-initiated gene expression experiments analysis.
•	hMitChip3 data files and database for compiling, filtering, browsing, displaying and visualizing gene expression profiles originated from data measured by using hMitChip3 gene chips.
•	GenInform database for compiling, browsing, displaying and visualizing gene informatics including molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, KEGG pathways, reactome events, genetic disorders, and PharmaGKB drug targets.  The database relates gene expression changes to gene informatics, therefore it facilitates interpretation of microarray results.
(5)      Softwares for data analysis include:
•	hMito2 gene expression data macro for automated filtering and extracting significantly differentially expression genes from microarray gene expression database;
•	LMCI v1.0 to cluster gene expression profiles;
•	Microarray gene expression data macro for standardized and automated filtering and extracting informative data from row data;
•	UniGDataConverter v1.0 to fetch bio-information from unigene database in any combinations;
•	LocalMaxCluster v1.2 to cluster gene expression profiles;

•	hMitChip3 DataExtractor v1.0 to compute and extract informative gene expression patterns from microarray data measured by using hMitChip3 gene chips
6.   Microarrays, Database, Algorithm and Software to be developed
Under this research agreement/contract, contractor will develop customized gene chips requested by the NICHD investigators upon approval by the NICHD Scientific Director, Dr. Owen Rennert.
In order to maintain our competitiveness in the cutting edge microarray technology, contractor would like to develop the following microarrays and relevant bioinformatics tools.
We would like to develop microarrays for study of human mitochondrial diseases.  After successful development of human mitochondrial gene expression chips (hMitEChip) for study mitochondrial diseases relevant to changes in gene expression, we would like to develop human mitochondrial gene mutation chips (hMitMChip).   Our preliminary searching for public database indicated that there are 300 – 500 genes with genetic disorders related to human diseases.  The mutations of these genes will be selected, designed, printed and tested for hMitMChip.  In addition, we would like to develop human mitochondrial siRNA gene chips (hMitSChip) to regulate gene expression on chips in cell culture so that effects of changes in a particular gene expression can be measured in a high-throughput fashion.   Database, software and gene informatics for hMitEChip are in tests and will be published soon.  Bioinformatics tools relevant to hMitMChip and hMitSChip ought to be developed along the corresponding microarrays.
To increase an efficiency of research and reduce slide-to-slide variance, we would like to develop expression microarrays with approximately 30K non-redundant human genes per slide and approximately 30K non-redundant mouse genes per slide, and their related database, algorithm and software as well.  One advantage of these microarrays is containing the almost entire genes of one species on the single gene chips and therefore, reduces slide-to-slide variance that would exist if these genes were printed on the separate chips.   
The contractor tested antibody arrays with commercial antibodies to detect protein expression.  The technology will be used to make customized antibody microarrays if the investigators request and provide antibodies for. 
The contractor would like to develop genomic DNA microarrays for as many as 10K promoter DNA clones of known genes for research projects such as transcription regulation, gene-promoter interactions, and DNA methylation, etc.  The related database and software will allow importing, exporting, organizing, displaying, browsing of promoter DNA sequences, controlled genes and their relationships. 
Contractor has also been developing diagnostic microarrays for expression and/or mutation analysis for translational research projects.
Contractor would like to develop “functional” microarrays to regulate gene expression on chips in cell culture at a large-scale in order to screen and categorize gene functions.

Scope of Work

In April 2006, DCP2 was launched at a conference in China, with launches later in 2006 in Africa.  While the intervention messages of the book have wide salience, the health care delivery and health system messages need greater exploration in the context of specific country settings.  There is currently a growing focus on health systems themselves as a constraint on improved health outcomes.  The aim of this proposal is to build on specific areas of DCP2 chapters and messages, by examining systemic constraints to and opportunities for the implementation of DCPP strategies.  Findings will inform and influence policies, programs, and resource allocation.

To make this task manageable, the work will focus on one African country and on the systems strengthening required to deliver specific interventions effectively and to scale.  In conjunction with local decision makers, specific tracer interventions will be identified to assess the ability of the health system to deliver.  These will be diseases/conditions such as HIV/AIDs treatment and care, malaria treatment, and maternal health chosen because they are of very high priority within the region, and present a diversity of challenges to health systems.  For example HIV/AIDS offers the chance to look at an intervention that is relatively well resourced, but which requires long term care.  Malaria sets countries numerous challenges; not least how to switch to more effective drugs, but involves treatment of an acute episode.  Maternal health is highly dependent on a functioning service infrastructure.  Inclusion of diseases does not imply a disease- specific emphasis – they will be used as tracers, to explore the nature of the health system strengthening required to scale-up interventions and services.

The proposed location for the work is Malawi.  The work will draw on the resources of the Consortium for Research on Equitable Health Systems (CREHS) and the Evidence for Action (EFA) Consortium which focuses on treatment and care delivery for HIV/AIDs.  CREHS is led by HEFP at the LSHTM, and its African partners are in Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria.  EfA is also led by LSHTM, and involves HEFP in supporting the health systems aspects of research.  One of its partners is Lighthouse in Malawi.  Other Malawian partners are being identified to provide additional research capacity.

In planning and implementing the work, HEFP will also collaborate with one of the South African CREHS partners, the Centre for Health Policy (CHP), University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.  Staff of CHP have been closely involved in thinking about and investigating the practical needs and demands of scaling up access to ARVs, and are also expert in health systems and policy analysis.  They participated in hosting several of the early DCPP workshops.

Failures in intervention delivery often have their roots in multiple levels:  for example, low take-up of malaria treatment at health centres may stem from lack of physical and financial accessibility to treatment; low perceived quality of care at health centres; unreliable drug supplies; and resource allocation systems which do not do well in transferring money to the local level.  Similarly, poor quality of treatment given by health workers may have its origin in both the local context (eg lack of support from district supervisors), and in rigid human resource management systems higher up the hierarchy.  DCP2 is able to make a series of important recommendations about the priorities that governments should in general be pursuing in health service delivery.  However, it has not yet fully integrated these recommendations with how to address existing constraints to effective service delivery in specific settings.

This work will examine the delivery of key services (eg HIV treatment and care, malaria treatment, and maternal health) at two levels of care – primary care and district hospitals.  It will focus on the recommendations of the DCP2, but aim to explore the constraints experienced at service delivery level to implementing these recommendations.  Approaches to lessening these constraints will be explored.  Care will be taken not to allow a focus on tracers to ignore system-wide implications of DCP2 taken more broadly.

Such work will begin to illuminate vital implementation lessons and approaches to complement the recommendations of DCP2.

Questions will be approached via 4 cross-cutting systems issues:
•	Financing
•	Human Resources
•	Organizational structures and relationships
•	Stewardship and regulation
However, these frameworks will be used primarily to structure the study approach.  Findings may emphasize different systems issues.

The starting points will be:
•	The DCP2 overview chapters 2 (on cost-effectiveness of interventions) and 3 (on strengthening health systems)
•	The disease/condition specific chapters: eg on HIV, Malaria, and maternal health (depending on chosen tracers)
•	The chapters on primary care, district hospitals, health workers, organization of clinical services, financing and Reaching the MDGs.

PRB will be requested to provide 2-3 page summaries of these chapters, to make them readily usable at country level with local decision makers.

In-country work will explore the implications of the recommendations of the disease/condition specific chapters to Malawi, given its existing health infrastructure, financing, human resources situation, etc.  This will draw also on the constraints analysis undertaken by HEFP for the CMH Working Group 5, to explore what needs to change and at what levels if successful scaling up is to be achieved.  Special attention will be paid to whether any of the chapter recommendations have been tried in Malawi, what constraints were encountered in design and implementation, and what change in performance resulted.

Methods of data collection and analyses will involve:
•	Interview with key individuals
•	Review of published and grey literature
•	Workshops with policy makers/managers, which discuss DCP2 recommendations, brainstorm key bottlenecks, rank them and discuss solutions
•	Development and application of focused tools around each of the ‘systems’ issues ie. Financing, human resources, organizational structures and relationships, and stewardship/regulation, at a number of case study facilities chosen on the basis that they are thought to represent better and worse performance.  An analysis of the functioning of these facilities will aim to triangulate views form interviews/workshops, and highlight how constraints at various levels of the system manifest at service delivery and are coped with.

The work will be undertaken with local partners who are closely connected to government, in order that they analyses produced can respond to policy-makers needs.

Results of the study will be made available to the ECSA Directors of Health meeting in July 2007, and their relevance more broadly to ECSA countries discussed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for Goddard Leadership Education Series (GLES) Program. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase training services from Greystone Consulting Inc., in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1)- Only One Responsible Source.   Center Management has been looking at all of Goddard's Leadership and Management Programs. Due to favorable feedback from past participants, Center Management decided to move forward with the next GLES class. Each session of GLES has been overwhelmingly successful and universally received high accolades. Due to timing of the GLES class beginning September 11, 2006 and registrations already taking place for the upcoming class, competition was not a reasonable use of time. The vendor of choice has already tailored their course to meet NASA requirements and standards for the program that the class is being taught for at this time.   In the fall of 2004, Greystone personnel delivered the 12-day, pilot program to 44 Goddard managers. The design was highly rated by all attendees. Greystone took the end-of-course feedback and made minor, but substantive changes, and provided a final course design to Goddard. Also included was a color, photo-ready, 315-page participant manual and an extensive reading library of 75 reference books for in-depth reading on any of the course core concepts. Given the success of the pilot program, the Center sponsored three more courses during calendar year 2005. Senior Greystone personnel delivered 17 of the eighteen training modules. Each of these courses have been overwhelmingly successful and universally received high accolades for both content and the professionalism and skills of the Greystone facilitation staff. This course is now viewed as an essential and core program for preparing and developing Goddard’s managers as leaders for Goddard’s future success. The GLES program that Greystone designed and delivered is totally unique in the public, private, and academic sectors.	It focuses totally on leadership not on management and is integrated from beginning to end. Three critical areas bound the program - managing self as a leader, leading change and leading collaboratively. Eighteen modules have been designed to span 5 leadership focus areas: self-awareness and progressing through interpersonal competence, group leadership, organizational dynamics and environmental impacts. Each module has been constructed to integrate proprietary learning modalities into a whole that specifically addresses the unique nature of Goddard’s culture. It is a rigorous program that fully embodies the needs of the adult learner. Teaching modalities span a wide spectrum including action learning, assessment instruments, films, small group inquiry, reading and reflection, simulations, role-playing, group and individual exercises, journaling and personal coaching. Also unique are the extensive use of core learning teams throughout the course. Participants experience an intensive learning event that is profound enough to be transformative and pragmatic enough to immediately apply in their actual work environment. The course learning standard is one of trust and respect for all differences.  All subsequent learning occurs in the context of the participant’s leadership vision.   Each participant receives individualized learning and support in the form of coaching and program facilitation in recognition that successful leadership development involves both personal and organizational transformation. The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. expends considerable effort to remain current on developments in the Federal Government, NASA, and Goddard environments.  This enables Greystone to modify the program to reflect current areas of emphasis and concern while tailoring the content to the individual and collective needs of the participants. A key feature of the GLES design is class created projects that reflect the current issues and solutions that the participants feel are relevant to their daily work. Some 25 such projects have been created and presented by class participants to Goddard’s Executive Council. Given their lead role in integrating all leadership programs and in designing and implementing all of the first four “new” GLES programs, The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. possesses unique knowledge and expertise resulting in a minimal learning curve, thus requiring the expenditure of fewer hours and dollars.  Greystone’s integral involvement since the need for this program was first identified in 2003 provides The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. with a unique and comprehensive understanding of the program and the workshops to date.	This understanding is essential to ensuring that future workshops align with what has been taught and do not unnecessarily repeat content.  It cannot be underestimated how critically important this thread of learning is to participants of NASA and to their contribution as current and future leaders of the Center. GSFC is beginning the process of evalutating and possibly redesigning all of its leadership training programs. Any redesigns may result in new requirement which may be competed. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organization may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on August 28, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice,is solely with the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit capability statements which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a  Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: 1.  FLO/EMC Floating Perpetual License, Per NASA DAK062006 (1 Job). Last item. No other software is compatible for use with NASA's systems and requirements.  This software license will be used in the development of a computational electromagnetic model in support of the Launch Services Program at KSC, FL.  FLO/EMC provides a high frequency solver that utilizes the Transmission Line Matrix and allows for broadband analysis with models that have a great amount of detail.  The tool can be run one time for results over a broadband of frequencies verses running the tool over one frequency at a time that most high frequency solvers require.  This allows the analyst to determine the culprit frequencies to investigate further in the very large complex solvers.  The tool allows for more detailed components to be analyzed and allows for the analysis of cable runs for routing analysis and more accurate shielding effectiveness calculations that tools such as FEKO and GEMACS are not designed to solve.  This tool was used to simulate lightning modeling which is a capability not currently implemented in other solvers as well.  FLO/EMC is designed to solve a specific class of problems within the EMC community.  This tool was chosen based on industry and DOD acceptance and usage as well as capability. Flomerics is the only provider of FLO/EMC software. NASA KSC has performed extensive research into possible vendor sources for this application, and has determined that Flomerics is the only vendor that offers software which meets these requirements.  No supplier was found.  To that end, the FLO/EMC Floating License must be used in order to ensure compatibility with processes, procedures, and systems that are used during mission operations.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the HP Compaq Servers as a key component of the Department’s OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm.  The equipment listed above is required to provide contingency/back-up servers, fault tolerant redundancy, recoverability and availability of our mission critical service of providing remote internet access in the event of a catastrophic failure.   The ONE server infrastructure is a HP Compaq environment, and any deviation to the Compaq server model would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of the network to State employees.  The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed. UPDATED LINE ITEM 006 PART #

After eight (8) months in Iraq, the two maintenance personnel will be given an additional two (2) weeks off. The same UAV PRO replacement team will cover the repair shop, during the second vacation period. Both of these R & R periods are paid time off. In addition, the replacement personnel will be paid at the same rate as regular Maintenance personnel. If military transport is not available, the cost for business class airfare for the two (2) trips for the two (2) replacement personnel will be added to the Subcontract.


4.	DELIVERABLES

4.1	Customer Requirements

The US Air Force customer requires maintaining a status of 85% mission capability. This is defined, as 85% Rover systems that are deployed are capable of completing a mission. The Rover repair contractor will be expected to repair and maintain Rover systems at a rate sufficient to comply with this requirement for all systems that remain deployed and are not returned to the factory for heavier repair service.

The effort required to maintain this level of operational capability will be significant. However, should this prove impossible, it is expected that the Rover repair contractor will contact US Air Force to discuss options, which may include increasing resources, such as personnel, or sending excess repair work back to the manufacturing repair facility.

4.2	Reporting Requirements

Field data regarding the repair requirements of the Rover system (and support equipment) is important to UAV PRO and the US Air Force. The Rover repair contractor will maintain accurate logs of every repair and every part replaced by serial number when such exist. Additional data, such as the root cause of failures, necessary product design changes, or other failure information shall be reported to Air Force on a monthly basis to the extent that such information is available to the contractor.
4.3	Material Handling Requirements

The Rover repair contractor shall never dispose of any piece of Rover system hardware or Air Force-owned support equipment, functioning or otherwise. All UAV PRO-supplied equipment shall be shipped back to UAV PRO in Virginia for processing at Air Force cost and in compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations if applicable. Any un-repairable Rover system discovered at the I Level Forward Center and/or components shall be returned to the US Air Force for disposition.

5.	OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

5.1	Travel
The Forward Repair and Maintenance Subcontractor will be stationed at Balad Airbase, Iraq. The subcontractor shall arrange for and provide subcontractor personnel travel between the United States and within Iraq. Travel should be by military transport whenever it is available and does not significantly impact performance under this SOW. Contractor shall demonstrate that the service level requested is maintained during the rotations planned.


5.2	Housing and Meals
The US Army at the Iraq Forward Center will provide the subcontractor personnel housing and meals. The only per diem allowance shall be for incidental expenses associated with deployment that remains when the housing and meals are deleted from the approved government per diem rate for Iraq.

5.3	Insurance
DBA insurance is required to be procured by the subcontractor for personnel conducting the repair and maintenance support in Iraq and shall be secured and maintained during the period of performance by the subcontractor. Prior to deployment the contractor shall provide US Air Force with a certificate of insurance indicating the coverage is in place at the statutory level required for the deployed personnel and that it is for the term of this proposed subcontract and with a carrier approved by the US Department of Labor.

5.4	Support Equipment
Air Force shall provide subcontractor with a list of special test equipment and tools needed to support the Rover system I-level repair and maintenance at the Balad Airbase, Iraq. Air Force will either provide the necessary equipment or shall provide separate funding authorization for the purchase of this equipment. The subcontractor shall provide all reasonable efforts to maintain equipment and tools, and return equipment and tools after the completion of the period of performance as directed by Air Force.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

Forward Repair and Maintenance Support for Rover II & III Systems & Installation of Video Transmitter and Camera Systems for Convoy Protection


1.	INTRODUCTION
USCENTCOM has a standing requested a Forward deployed Repair and Maintenance Subcontractor to provide repair and support services for in-theater Rover system.  The maintenance will be conducted in the Middle East Theater at Balad Airbase, Iraq. This maintenance includes repairs that can not be conducted in the field by the operator.  Due to the limited number of systems and critical need for these systems to be operational these repairs must be conducted in theater to reduce the amount of down time these systems are in Depot. 

USCENTCOM has also requested a team with the ability to provide surveillance systems for bridges and overpasses.  These surveillance systems will be used as a recognizance tool to observe critical areas prior to convoys reaching these Danger crossings.  These surveillance systems will help reduce the number of successful IED attacks on coalition convoys by distributing real time video surveillance.
   
2.	BACKGROUND

DOD is engaging in a sustained production effort to deploy the Rover systems to the Middle East. Initially, this forward repair and maintenance support contract will be only for the Rover II/ III system used by the US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The forward repair and maintenance support facility will be located at Balad Airbase, Iraq to facilitate a rapid re-supply of critical items.

Over 200 Rover systems will be deployed into Iraq and Afghanistan by the end of the calendar year. The US Army, US Air Force and US Marine Corps have established the goal of maintaining an 85% operational mission capability. 

There are three levels of support envisioned by the US Army and US Air Force:

O-Level (Operator Level):
This is repair work that can be done by the operator during training and/or in the field. The nominal repair time is less than 10 minutes. The typical repairs are replacing / swapping of the major Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).

I-Level (Intermediate Level):
This is repair work that is done by the Forward Repair and Maintenance Subcontractor located in Iraq at Balad Airbase. This repair and maintenance activity includes all O-level tasks plus general troubleshooting to identify subcomponent faults, replacement of major subassemblies, and minor repairs. Repaired Rover systems are returned to the operators and un-repairable units are returned to the operators for returned to the manufacturer for additional diagnosis and repair.


D-Level (Depot Level):
This includes all other repair work that cannot be accomplished at the Operator or Intermediate Level and will be performed by the manufacturer of the Rover system at the Logistics Facility in the United States.

3.	SCOPE

3.1	Duration
The duration of this agreement is anticipated to be for a one-year period of performance from xx-xx-xxxx to xx-xx-xxxx
However, US Air Force reserves the right to change the Subcontract as well as this SOW by providing UAV PRO with advance written notice of a required change. Based on the directed change UAV PRO shall immediately precede with the change and provide the Air force with a cost proposal reflecting any significant cost impact the change may have on its performance of this SOW and the Agreement.

3.2	Repair and Maintenance Responsibility
The Forward Repair and Maintenance Subcontractor will be responsible for providing the I-level support as defined above on a basis of “ON CALL” 24 hour per day seven days per week. It is anticipated that the I-level support will be a best level-of-effort with a full-time team of two (2) UAV PRO employees based at the Balad Airbase Forward Center. To meet the “ON CALL” requirement, the maintenance personnel will put in a minimum of twelve (12) hours a day at the work site. After hours, they can be reached at all times via satellite cell phonpn.gov/login.aspx for information regarding the Online Representation and Certification Application process.  Quotations may be submitted via fax to 803-895-6040 or by e-mail to nadine.catania@shaw.af.mil , or mailed to the attention of SSgt Nadine Catania at 20 CONS/LGCAA, 305 Blue Jay Street, Shaw AFB, SC 29152.
