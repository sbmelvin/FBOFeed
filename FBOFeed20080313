INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm . 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.

Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.

More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

The 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of DELL laptop computers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Embassy Baghdad has identified the Dell laptop computers as a key component of the DoD networking system.  This equipment is reliable and expendable supply is available.  It is also supportable by on-site staff.  The purchase is for DoS staff working in a DoD forward base.  This purchase is authorized by a formal MOA between COM and DoD. As this is a brand name only justification, any substitution would impact operations by causing the Embassy to spend more money on training, parts, and equipment inventory.  It would also require reengineering of Defense networks to support non-standard equipment.  In the Iraq ware environment, it is essential to maintain compatible systems. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable: The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid. The equipment selection is based on four years of use in a very harsh environment.  Other printer brands have been used and they fail quickly or do not meet common infrastructure needs.<BR><BR>

<SOLNBR>AB133C-08-RP-0007
<RESPDATE>022508
<CONTACT>Sharon Kent, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6035, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email sharon.s.kent@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA's National Ocean Service, Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) has responsibilities as a Federal trustee for natural resources under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended, to identify and assess risks to coastal marine resources from uncontrolled hazardous waste sites, in assessing natural resource injuries, and in developing plans for resource protection, restoration, and rehabilitation.  Early coordination and notification of potential natural resource injuries allows NOAA to carry out its responsibilities under CERCLA and the National Contingency Plan while minimizing interference in site cleanup schedules. Early coordination and notification of potential natural resource injuries allows Federal and state resource trustees to carry out responsibilities under Section 107 of the CERCLA, Executive Order 12580, and Subpart G of the National Contingency Plan while minimizing interference in site cleanup schedules.  The contractor shall perform various tasks that will identify and assess risks to coastal natural resources from hazardous waste sites and develop cost-effective strategies to minimize those risks.  The major tasks are:

Task A - Evaluate the potential for injury to NOAA resources from hazardous substance release.  This task shall require reviewing historical site files, evaluating data collected during hazardous waste site investigations, conducting site visits, and evaluating other literature that relates to contaminants, habitats, and species that may be affected by a release including: a) Providing natural resource data relevant to NOAA trust resources; b) Providing information on environmental fate and transport of specific contaminants in surface water, sediment, and biological pathways; c) Identifying environmental receptors, sensitive habitats, bioaccumulation potential, commercial and recreational use of trust resources; d) Specifying physical, biological, and chemical analytical procedures for aquatic environments; e) Identifying sample locations and frequencies; f) Evaluating the potential impacts of contamination on natural resource receptors; g) Identifying or reviewing alternative action levels for aquatic environments where regulatory standards do not exist; and h) Identifying potential adverse environmental impacts of alternatives.  

Task B - Conduct field survey of hazardous substances releases to document the extent of contamination in habitats and organisms of interest to NOAA.  NOAA shall identify the sites where these investigations will be conducted.  Specific field studies may require sampling to support: a) Evaluating the source and spatial distribution of contaminants to determine the significance of the release in relation to other potential pollution sources; b) Investigating the temporal distribution and fate of contaminants in the environment; and c) Determining the level of contamination in species of concern and evaluating the contribution of those contaminants to the degradation of trustee resources.  Investigations may include the use of biological assessment procedures such as bioassays.

Task C - Support environmental assessments of potential injuries to natural resources for which NOAA acts as a trustee or co-trustee resulting from releases of hazardous substances.  These surveys will be used by NOAA in evaluating appropriate remedial actions and reaching settlements with defendants in actions brought under CERCLA.  In general, the Contractor shall be responsible for gathering and interpreting information necessary to evaluate the potential ecological risks associated with releases from a hazardous waste site.  The surveys shall require: a) Interpreting data to evaluate concentrations of contaminants in aquatic habitats; b) Identifying pathways and habitats of concern and the data necessary to characterize the environmental setting of the site; c) Evaluating the potential impacts of contamination on natural resource receptors; and e) Identifying natural resources that could be affected by a site and complete NOAA site reports to identify threat to trust resources and the environment

Task D - Provide assistance in restoration planning (including injury magnitude and restoration scaling), restoration project alternatives analysis & selection, development of habitat restoration plans, assembly of pubic outreach materials and compiling information and documentation needed for NEPA compliance, EFH consultation, cultural resource evaluation and CZM consistency determinations and various other requirements for restoration projects considered for compensation for natural resource injuries, projects under consideration by a trustee council, or actually designated as part of settlements with responsible parties to resolve natural resource damage liability under CERCLA.  These plans, documents, reports and public outreach materials will be used by NOAA in evaluating appropriate restoration alternatives and establishing the appropriate documentation and project plans for meeting federal and state requirements for restoration project planning, public review, and implementation 

Deliverables include Coastal Hazardous Waste Site Reports, Preliminary Natural Resource Surveys, general site evaluation reports, supporting documents for ecological risk assessment reports and monitoring plans, database catalogs, and draft restoration plans, documents, reports and public outreach materials.  Progress reporting on sites reviewed and status of tasks for reports and databases will be required monthly.

This contract may be performed from any location in the continental United States.  Studies will be conducted primarily in coastal areas of the United States, territories, and protectorates.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price, labor hour or time-and-material task order IDIQ type contract will be awarded with a base 12-month period and four one-year option periods.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620 with a size standard of $6.5 M.   All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.

<DESC>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a contractor to operate the food services facilities located at the Government Printing Office (GPO), 710 N. Capitol Street NW, 8th Floor.  The GPO views its cafeteria, catering and vending services program as a significant employee benefit serving approximately 2,500 employees daily.  GPO will not be held responsible for any variation from this employee population figure because the extent of occupancy is not guaranteed.  The challenge facing the selected Contractor will be to present a food service program for cafeteria services, catering and vending services that offer a range of reasonably priced food items that appeals to all segments of the building population as stated in the terms and conditions of the resulting contract.  The successful contractor shall also establish and operate in the contractor?s name, provided breakfast and lunch, Monday through Friday, including a variety of food that not only appeals to all segments of the building population, but that will also benefit cafeteria users and comply with USDA accepted health and nutrition standards.  The required level of service will be maintained and/or expanded by the contractor, as needed.  This is NOT a request for proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the contractor or Government to perform these services.  Parties interested and receiving an RFP can send their contact information to bwilliams@gpo.gov by April 4, 2008.  Responses to this notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Design/Build Construction Services for the Tuttle Annex Building, Atlanta, GA
<SOLNBR>GS-04P-07-EX-C-0104
<RESPDATE>070907
<CONTACT>Glenda Burns, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-331-2750, Fax 404-331-7696, Email glenda.burns@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design-Build Construction Services for the new Tuttle Annex Building, Atlanta, Georgia.  

The Design-Build Contractor will be competitively chosen using the Advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202) and Design/Build Selection Process (FAR 36.303).    

PROJECT SUMMARY:  The project is located in the Fairlie Poplar Historic District in downtown Atlanta Georgia,  adjacent to the Tuttle Building which houses the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The properties consist of two existing 5 story office buildings (96 Poplar Street and 70 Fairlie Street) and a vacant lot fronting Poplar Street and Cone Street. These properties occupy approximately 75% of a city block in the city of Atlanta bordered by Fairlie Street, Poplar Street, Cone Street, and Walden Street. The two existing buildings to be rehabilitated are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and both are contributing structures to the Fairlie Poplar Historic District.  The project site itself is highly constrained and is located in a dense urban area of Atlanta. 

The objectives of the project are to provide administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal in Atlanta, Georgia. The administrative office space will be physically linked with the court facilities through  a cut-and-cover tunnel, under Fairlie Street.  The office space will be provided by  connecting the new annex and Tuttle building, rehabilitation and adaptive use of two existing five story office buildings containing approximately 134,000 gross square feet with approximately 24 basement parking spaces, and a new one story loading dock - building entrance over basement parking on a vacant lot adjacent to the two buildings. A portion of the basement parking area will be developed under one of the existing buildings.  The project will also provide innovative technologies and features which will support improved occupant productivity, energy conservation, space flexibility, reliable systems operation, sustainability, and low maintenance. To enhance security, vulnerable portions of the exterior envelopes of the existing buildings will be reinforced and the heavy wood frame structures of the existing buildings will be modified to address blast uplift and floor alignment issues and the mitigation of progressive collapse.  All design and construction work must comply with local, state and Federal government codes and standards.

The General Services Administration is using the ?Bridging? Design Build method to deliver this project. The Bridging contract drawings and specifications have been completed by the bridging architect, Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow and their consultants. These documents and other documents, constituting the Bridging contract documents, will be available to the firms submiting in Phase II. The Architect and Engineers of record will be members of the selected Design Build Contractor?s team. Construction will not commence until final construction documents are reviewed by GSA and a Notice to Proceed with construction is issued.  

The Bridging contract documents will define all of the GSA requirements for critical design elements of the project and will include final space plans, interior finishes, performance criteria for major building systems and other design information.

The project includes: Replace and install new windows. Roof replacement. complete new space build-out including new interior partitions and finishes, new mechanical systems, new electrical systems, and new plumbing systems. The Bridging Contract documents anticipate that the first floor heavy timber floor structure of the 96 Popular building will be demolished and replaced with a new floor that aligns with the first floor of the 70 Fairlie Building. The new floor height will allow enough ceiling height for vehicular parking spaces under the 96 Poplar Street building. The basement area of the 96 Poplar Street building will be modified to accommodate vehicle parking and the tunnel under Fairlie Street to the Tuttle Building. A one story covered loading dock and building entrance will be constructed on the existing vacant surface parking lot. The loading dock will include an enclosed area for service vehicles, area for waste containers, enclosed storage, and vehicle entrance to the ramp that provides the only access to the basement parking area. The employee entrance will contain an entrance lobby, a security check-in area, and mail room. The basement of the one story covered loading dock will contain below grade vehicle parking and a ramp. A pedestrian tunnel will be constructed under Fairlie Street connecting the new annex to the existing Tuttle Building. The area of the two existing historic buildings to be rehabilitated is approximately 123,000 gsf while the area of new construction - one story loading dock and building entrance totals approximately 11,000 gsf for a total project area of approximately 134,000 gsf.  

The design of the interiors of the project represents ?state of the art,? twenty-first century office environment. The new loading dock and building entrance located in the surface parking is designed to be aesthetically compatible with existing adjacent buildings and the urban context of the site. The exterior of the existing historic buildings are intended to be models of successful preservation and rehabilitation. The project will be designed and constructed so that a LEEDS silver certification can be obtained.

The total design and construction cost for this project is estimated between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000.

The following is a brief synopsis of the AT21 requirement:  

Agile Transportation for the 21st Century will identify and implement business processes and systems that enable USTRANSCOM?s distribution planning, transportation planning, and transportation execution activities in support of the DOD distribution enterprise. This effort will apply best business practices and leverage order management and transportation management technologies; enhance supply chain capabilities resulting in reduced deployment and distribution cycle times, increased customer satisfaction via tailored distribution support, and reduced customer wait time; and, achieve of an environment that provides asset visibility throughout the supply chain and leads to decreased materiel costs.

The effort will focus less on capturing the ?as-is? processes and more on providing a solution ?blueprint? that best meets the program objectives (mission capability and performance), addressing and integrating the myriad of enterprise-wide elements including: organization, culture, personnel competency, business processes, facilities and assets, and enabling information technology. The ultimate solution should define and enable end-to-end integrated processes to achieve transformational impact, rather than applying technology to existing processes for incremental improvement. 

This requirement will be managed in increments as shown below.  Initiation of each increment is not necessarily dependent on the completion of the previous increment.  

Increment	Description
I	Requirements Consolidation and Workflow Management
II	Strategic-Level Optimization and Scheduling
III	Operational-Level Optimization and Scheduling
Post Incr III	Post Increment 3 Support

Specific AT21 requirements will be identified in the Capability Development Document (CDD) and in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to be included in the upcoming draft solicitation expected to be released the week of October 16, 206.

Offerors shall submit a combined technical/business proposal and one functioning sample of their proposed product for limited verification testing along with draft operator?s manual.    Performance of the product sample will be evaluated against the performance specification.  Failure to submit a product sample will make an offeror?s proposal unacceptable.  An original and two (2) written copies of the proposal are required.  Proposals shall be prepared using "Arial" or "Times New Roman" 12-point font style on 8 1/2 x 11 inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points.  Foldouts are not allowed.  All material submitted may be single-spaced.  Offerors should ensure that each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer.  Page count for the combined technical/busine!  ss proposal shall not exceed 50 total pages, not including the draft operator?s manual.  All printed material, except for the draft manual, counts towards the 50-page limit.  Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) on 14 May, 2008: COMMANDER, Attn,  Mr. Moxi Mi,  CT025-GTES, MARCORSYSCOM, 2201A Willis Street, Quantico, VA 22134-5060. NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.   The offeror must provide one production representative product sample of the MSD configuration as proposed no later than the time deadline for proposal submission.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors: Operational Effectiveness -- Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in the performance specification for the MSD.  Key features to address are identified in the performance specification as critical performance parameters (CPPs).  Supportability -- Key Supportability issues to address include Publications and Data and Warranty provisions.  Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the product.  Past Performance -- Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.!    Relative Order of Importance: (i) Operational Effectiveness -- Most important. (ii) Supportability -- Less important.  (iii) Past Performance -- Least  important.  Price -- Evaluated, but not rated.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the Government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall operational effectiveness, supportability, and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  Value Added features, if any listed by the offeror will be factored in.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the !  offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer  (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.   FAR Clauses: 52. 212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation !  will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for !  accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on!

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center (Aircraft Division) Patuxent River, MD, seeks engineering support for the design, development, testing, aircraft integration, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of an externally mounted airbag system for rotary platforms.  The external airbag protection system is intended to greatly reduce the potential for occupant injury from abrupt decelerations associated with a crash impact.  The system is also expected to greatly reduce airframe damage from impact whose predominant component is in the vertical direction. 

The system is expected to deploy automatically during an emergency situation in which a moderate to high energy crash impact is eminent.  Without aid of any other vertical energy absorbing devices, the system is expected to prevent occupant injury in mishaps with a vertical impact velocity of 12 to 37 feet per second (fps).  Below 12 fps the energy absorption inherent in the airframe design is expected to be sufficient to prevent occupant injury and serious airframe damage.  Above 37 fps, the system, due to the severity of the event, will demonstrate a gradual decrease in its ability to prevent occupant exposure to abrupt decelerations.  The system should also be capable of providing occupant and airframe protection in moderately energetic combined velocity and attitude conditions.  

The system is expected to remain operational during and after being subjected to a wide range of operating conditions.  Examples include exposure to: high temperature, low temperature, aircraft induced vibration, mechanical shock, lightning strikes, rain, dust, salt fog, changes in atmospheric pressure, aircraft fluids, cleaning solutions, and magnetic fields.  RTCA/Document-160 provides more detail on the operating conditions that the system will be expected to survive and function in without damage.

Responses shall address the work required and a detailed work breakdown schedule (WBS) to gain FAA certification of the External Airbag System for the TH-57 / Bell 206B Jet Ranger III helicopter.  The system and component level development plan shall be tailored to adhere to all applicable Federal Aviation Administration policies, procedures, and protocols for obtaining a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for installation of this system onto the Navy?s TH-57 fleet.  Particular procedures and protocols are outlined in FAA Advisory Circular AC 21-40, RTCA/Document-178, and RTCA/Document-254.  AC 21-40 can be obtained online by going to www.airweb.faa.gov.  All RTCA documents can be purchased online from RTCA by going to www.rtca.org. 

This effort will require a wide range of laboratory experiments, component level tests, and integrated system level tests to demonstrate suitability of the system to progress to increasingly higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).  At completion, the system is expected to have achieved a TRL of 8 (i.e. Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration) and be ready for submission to formal FAA certification testing.

The work described in this synopsis is expected to be ongoing for approximately two to three years.  During this period, the contractor is expected to provide monthly electronic status reports in addition to a final report and support regularly scheduled technical interchange meetings.  Furthermore, the contractor is also expected to provide written reports detailing the outcome of experimental results and studies.  At the end of this period, developmental work on this system is expected to be complete.

It is anticipated that a sole source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be awarded to BAE Systems, 7822 South 46th Street, Phoenix, AZ  85044-5354.  BAE Systems has already completed preliminary research and development of this system and the Government intends to negotiate solely with BAE to continue development.  The estimated value of this requirement is $14 million.  Responses to this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to Amber.F.Wood@navy.mil before 28 April 2008.

Numbered Note 22 applies to this announcement.

Additional submission instructions are available at the website under Submitting a Proposal? Broad Agency Announcement for Deployable Systems: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare, is soliciting innovative research and development proposals of multiple mechanical/ocean engineering concepts for automated deployment, recovery and operation of hydrophone and acoustic source arrays deployed from small craft (e.g., 11 m), suspended from buoys, located on the littoral ocean bottom, and deployed from non-dedicated surface ships.  Of additional interest are concepts supporting the networking of such platform systems to provide robust anti-submarine warfare (ASW); command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR); port/harbor surveillance; and global maritime domain awareness. While various military ships can be considered, Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS) Ships, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) or small craft are of most interest to the Navy.  The areas of interest include: (1) compact, low frequency acoustic source arrays; (2) deployment and retrieval mechanisms; (3) innovative packaging; (4) compact, lightweight power electronics (amplifiers, energy storage); (5) power systems for the lightweight towed arrays; (6) various material storage and handling systems; (7) associated control systems, and software/networking concepts to support distributed C4ISR sensors and global maritime domain awareness; and (8) adaptations of small craft design which may better support such sensor systems. SSC San Diego, in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare and the Office of Naval Research, is similarly soliciting innovative research and development proposals to explore use of a small surface craft or buoys to deploy and operate undersea acoustic sensors systems.  The challenges presented by undersea threats provide the impetus for the development of deployable and off-board acoustic surveillance systems which are networked, distributed, and multistatic- capable, such as Advanced Deployable System (ADS), Fixed Distributed System (FDS), and Deployable Autonomous Distributed Systems (DADS).  The very low noise levels associated with modern submarines are a significant challenge for passive systems and a natural augmentation of such systems is the addition of an acoustic source.  In addition to working with the deployed systems, the active signals from such sources could also be received and processed by surface ships with towed arrays.  In this context an active system has the potential for significant improvement in coverage against a quiet target over a purely passive system.  An additional benefit for acoustic sources deployed from small craft, Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) or buoys is that this eliminates the vulnerability associated with operating an acoustic source from a large vessel (beaconing).  Operations involving a group of  small craft pose several challenges including: (1) dynamics of a small craft from the standpoints of deployment and recovery of a low frequency active array; (2) shock and vibration effects associated with high speed transit of small craft; (3) energy storage and management; (4) high efficiency, high power density amplifiers and transducers; (5) power plant sizing to maximize mission performance; and (6) networking and processing to exploit information provided by distributed sensors and information systems. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. Awards may take the form of procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements, as appropriate.  Awards will only be made for basic research, applied research, or development that is not related to the development of a specific system. Awards will not be made for commercial or non-developmental items.  Award decisions will be based on a selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.  Regardless of the ratings on individual proposals, the Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government may also only select specific tasks within a proposal for award.  No additional request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  It is estimated that three awards may be made as a result of this announcement with approximate ceiling amounts of $1,000,000 each.  Proposals are sought now for award and work efforts in FY08 and FY09. Contractors are invited to submit cost and technical proposals for one or more of the above areas.  Proposals are due no later than 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 27 March 2009; however, those proposals which are received by 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 31 March 2008 will have the greatest chance of being funded.  Proposals can be submitted at anytime during which the BAA is open.   Government reviews shall occur at 90 day intervals (i.e., quarterly) from the initial BAA posting date, or as required by the Government. Those proposals submitted within one of the four 90 day intervals shall be reviewed by the Government.    Proposals must be submitted electronically to the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  Click on "SSC San Diego" and then "Open BAA." Additional submission instructions are available at the website under "Submitting a Proposal?" The cost proposal shall be prepared in accordance with the two documents at the website titled "Cost Proposal Instructions" and "Cost Proposal Sample Spreadsheet."  There is no page limitation for the cost proposal The technical proposal shall not exceed twenty (20) pages in length, single- sided on 8 ý by 11-inch paper.  The technical proposal shall be structured to address the following items, in the stated order: (1) BAA topic area addressed by proposal; (2) summary of key elements within proposal; (3) ability of proposed work to satisfy BAA goals; (4) detailed explanation of proposed work, technical approach, critical issues, etc.; (5) schedule and milestones; (6) explanation of all deliverables, with identification of any data, information or software deliverables that would be provided to the Government with other than unlimited rights; (7) self-evaluation of proposal against the BAA evaluation factors; and (8) explanation of how the proposed effort satisfies the definition (s) of basic research, applied research, or development that is not related to the development of a specific system; the definitions are available at the website.  SSC San Diego will reject proposals that do not conform to instructions. The proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are of equal importance: (1) potential contribution to the mission of the SURTASS and/or LCS programs to increase program responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness; (2) overall scientific and technical merit, validity of approach, and probability of successfully demonstrating the proposed technology; (3) realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds; (4) potential for economical integration (positive return on investment) into existing and future Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) operations; and (5) interest by NAVSEA components in fielding successful concepts. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among these entities.  SSC San Diego provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Information and material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  Questions of a contractual or technical nature should be directed to Ms. Sylvia Evans, SSC San Diego Code 225, via e-mail: sylvia.evans@navy.mil or telephone (619) 553-3292.

<DESC>*************Please contact Joe McCollister/Contract Specialist via email at joseph.m.mccollister@nasa.gov or fax 256-961-4753. ********************* NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one thermal catalyst. The thermal catalyst will be purchased from Environmental and Life Support Technology, Inc. D.B.A. ELS only for the following reasons. 1.     The purpose of this procurement is to support the development of thermal catalysts for the NASA Exploration Mission.  These thermal catalysts are specific for the catalytic oxidation of volatile organics in aqueous waste streams during manned missions.  The limited funding available will support only the procurement of one catalyst already developed and ready for testing.  The principal investigator for this research effort at MSFC has extensive experience in this field (19 years at MSFC supporting the development of technologies for water recovery systems), and is thus aware of current research in this field.  As such, there are a limited number of companies that are capable of manufacturing catalysts for this specific application.	Two such catalysts are already in possession at the MSFC ECLS Test Facility based on previous research performed with other contractors.  ELS Technology, Inc. has developed the catalyst on synthetic carbon substrate under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  However, insufficient catalyst was manufactured during this effort to support the MSFC evaluation.  Therefore, this procurement will acquire the catalyst previously developed by ELS Technology, Inc. for further evaluation at MSFC.   2.    ELS Technology, Inc. is a small business that has had multiple successful research projects with NASA and specifically MSFC.  This company has significant expertise in the development of thermal catalyst; therefore their involvement in this program will take advantage of their intellectual property in the field of thermal catalyst development.  In addition to the existing thermal catalyst, ELS Technology has previously developed two other catalyst technologies with application to the NASA Exploration Mission.  However, additional development effort will be required before catalyst procurement is merited, and insufficient funds are available at this time. 3.    Based on the expertise of the Principal Investigator in this field, the only available catalyst that can be purchased with the funds available in FY08 is that catalyst developed by ELS Technology, Inc.  Funding available in future years will provide the opportunity to compete (in a full and open competition) research efforts among qualified companies toward the development and delivery of viable catalysts.  However, given the limited funds available in FY08, the catalyst available from ELS Technology, Inc. is the only viable procurement that meets the objective of the MSFC test effort.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. CST on 3/19/2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed. Ombudsman (OCT 2003) (a)  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  (b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman. Robin N. Henderson George C. Marshall Space Flight Center 256-961-1919 (office) 256-544-8369 (fax) robin.n.henderson@nasa.gov Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the NASA ombudsman, the Director of the Contract Management Division, at 202-358-0445, facsimile 202-358-3083, e-mail, james.a.balinskas@nasa.gov.  Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting officer or as specified elsewhere in this document.  (ALTERNATE  I) (JUN 2000) (c)  If this is a task or delivery order contract, the ombudsman shall review complaints from contractors and ensure they are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures of the contract.

Habibullah Integrated Coal Mining/Power Generation Feasibility Study

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that would develop a plan for the reliable supply of coal of consistent quality and quantity to an appropriately located power plant, and would also help determine the appropriate plant configuration and technology.

The Grantee holds a Letter of Interest, issued through Pakistan's Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), to undertake a power generation Feasibility Study based on coal from its two leases in the Lakhra coalfield.  Habibullah Mines Limited (HML), a sister company of the Grantee, is concurrently looking to develop a plan to modernize its coal mining operations in anticipation of ramping up its coal supply for the power generation project.  The integrated Feasibility Study would include an evaluation of coal reserves available through the two leases and identify the period that the quantity can support the operations of a 150 MW electricity generation enterprise.  The Feasibility Study will also assist in developing and planning for appropriate mining operations suited to the quantity and quality of coal required, and to meet generally accepted international mine safety and health standards.  Additionally, the Feasibility Study will examine the necessary aspects for establishing a modern, environmentally-friendly coal-fueled electricity generation station, including site selection, selection of coal combustion technology, compliance with acceptable environmental emission standards, optimizing the station's heat rate, and the design of the facilities including arrangements, or alternatives, for cooling water.

The Feasibility Study will be used by the Grantee to negotiate the power purchase agreement (PPA), a parallel operating agreement (OA), and fuel supply arrangement (FSA) with appropriate parties, as well as the tariff structure with Pakistan's National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.  Following a successful Feasibility Study, PPIB would be in the position to issue a Letter of Support, which together with the approved PPA, OA and FSA, would provide the basis for the financial closure of the project and its construction and operation.  The Feasibility Study would also help determine which of three modern technologies (pulverized coal combustion, circulating fluidized bed combustion, and integrated gasification combined cycle) and which of two basic plant configurations (two 75 MW units or a single 150 MW unit) should be used.  Both of these decisions will be influenced by the quality of the coal that will be supplied for the plant, as well as environmental concerns and requirements.  The location of the plant, with critical factors being the plant's fresh water requirement, coal supply source selection, and proximity to the national power grid will also be a component of the Feasibility Study.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from an $810,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  The Grantee will contribute an additional $810,000 for a total of U.S. $1,620,000 dollars.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00PM, LOCAL TIME May 15, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement for Organizational Level Aircraft Maintenance Services in support of the United States Marine Corps Aviation RESET Project.  Support is required for the following Marine Corps Aircraft: AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, KC-130J, AH-1W, UH-1N, CH-46E, CH-53D/E and MV-22.  Support shall be required both inside and outside CONUS at the following locations: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; MCAS Cherry Point, NC; MCAS New River, NC; MCAS Beaufort, SC; MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI; MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, Japan; MCAS Iwakuni, Japan; and Al Asad Air Base, Iraq.
The primary goal of the RESET project is to maintain each of the aircraft identified above in its optimal material condition.  In order to achieve this goal, the project shall employ a special program of Conditional Inspections and Phased Maintenance which shall include inspection, cleaning, corrosion treatment, servicing, disassembly, reassembly, repair and select mandatory replacement of parts.  This program shall feature three distinct RESET events:

(1) A PRESET, which shall be performed on all aircraft leaving for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), in order to establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level prior to deployment;
(2) IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT, which shall be performed as needed on deployed aircraft in order to maintain the material condition of the aircraft at the level that was established during the PRESET; and
(3) A RECONSTITUTION, which shall be performed on all aircraft returning from the GWOT, in order to re-establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level.

A secondary goal of the RESET Project is to reduce the maintenance burden on Organizational Level Marines.  This goal shall be accomplished by allowing contractors to perform General Organizational Level Maintenance tasks when they are not engaged in activities to support the RESET events outlined above.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $6.5M.  The Product Service Code for this requirement is J015.

This project is the Marine Corps first attempt at an organized, centrally-managed RESET Program.  However, a number of the platforms and locations listed above have active or recent contracts for PRESET, IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT, and/or RECONSTITUTION services, or active or recent contracts for Engineering and Technical Services, or General Organizational Level Maintenance, under which RESET-related tasking is being performed.

On 1 November 2007, NAWCAD issued a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of this requirement.  NAWCAD received thirty-five (35) responses to this notice.  These thirty-five responses included responses from:

- (18) Small Businesses (2 capable)
- (6) 8(a) Small Businesses (2 capable)
- (5) HUBZone Small Businesses (0 capable)
- (5) Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (1 capable)
- (10) Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (1 capable)
- (4) Woman-Owned Small Businesses (0 capable)

Two or more Small Businesses were determined to be capable on the following aircraft platforms: AH-1W, UH-1N, CH-53D/E.  Two or more 8(a) Small Businesses were determined to be capable on the following aircraft platform: CH-46E.  Two or more Small Businesses were not determined to be capable on the following platforms: AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, KC-130J and MV-22.  Based on this information, the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has determined that a set-aside for Small Business is appropriate for the AH-1W, UH-1N and CH-53D/E platforms, that an 8(a) competition is appropriate for the CH-46E platform, and that Full and Open Competition is appropriate for the AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, KC-130J and MV-22 platforms.  The NAVAIR Small Business Office concurs with this decision.

NAWCAD intends to release a single competitive solicitation featuring split contract awards.  NAWCAD may award as few as one (1), or as many as five (5) contracts.  The following aircraft platforms shall be grouped together in the solicitation:

Group 1: AV-8B, F/A-18A+/C/D, EA-6B (Full & Open Competition)
Group 2: KC-130J (Full & Open Competition)
Group 3: AH-1W, UH-1N, CH-53D/E (Small Business Set-Aside)
Group 4: CH-46E (8(a) Competition)
Group 5: MV-22 (Full & Open Competition).

Each contract shall provide for RESET services at all required locations, both CONUS and OCONUS, for the applicable platforms.  In order to provide stability, continuity and flexibility to the Marine Corps, each contract shall consist of a base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  This requirement shall be awarded on a predominantly Firm Fixed Price basis, although the contract may contain some Labor Hour and Cost-Type elements to address secondary goals.  All responsible sources may submit proposals in response to the solicitation, which the Government shall consider.

NAWCAD expects that a Draft of the Solicitation (excluding Sections L&M) shall be available to industry in mid-April.  When the draft becomes available, NAWCAD shall post it to the FBO website or to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) website at the following URL:

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Accelrys, Inc. 10188 Telesis Ct., Ste. 100, San Diego, CA to provide continued software maintenance for DMOL3 and the Materials Studio Visualizers. The key feature for performance and function are the numerical atom-centered basis sets, which allow the same level of theory to be used for small organic molecules as for solids and surfaces.  Other solid state codes that use a planewave basis set require very high-energy cutoffs, large memory, and long computation time that make describing molecular adsorption and hydrogen problematic and inefficient.  No other commercial code has numerical basis sets.  DMOL3 is also an all electron code, and does not require the use of less accurate pseudopotentials or muffin tins to describe core electrons.  NIST also requires that the results be accessible through the Cerius2 and Materials Studio visualizers and interface software, which NIST already has in-house.  DMOL3 is NIST?s primary computational instrument, and NIST has been using it for more than six(6) years to generate results.  NIST needs to be able to compare the numerical results from new calculations with the old DMOL3 results, otherwise NIST has to repeat six (6) years worth of work because of numerical differences between methods. No other vendor offers DMOL3 or the MS Visulizer. Product must meet all applicable 508 Standards.
A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about March, 21, 2008 The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the  Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems intends to issue a  solicitation for the manufacture and delivery of the M762A1 Electronic Time  (ET) Fuze and M762A1 ET Safe & Arm (S&A) Assemblies.  The M762A1 Fuze is an  electronic fuze used with spin stabilized 105mm and 155mm artillery cargo  carrying projectiles.  The M762A1 ET Fuze in the time mode can be set manually  without the need of a tool or set inductively via an inductive link with the  M1155 Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (PIAFS). These setting features  support an increase in the rate of fire and reduce the potential for fuze  setting mistakes due to human errors. In the time mode the fuze is settable  from 0.5 seconds to 199.9 seconds in 0.1 second increments.  The Government  expects to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract for an approximate base  quantity in the range of 20K-25K.  The contract will include four option years  with ranges for the following approximate quantities:  FY09 (25K-31K); FY10  (25K-32K); FY11 (30K-50K); FY12 (30K-44K). The contract will also include  options with ranges for supplemental Army, and Marine Corps requirements:   FY08 (10K-20K); FY09 (10K-25K); FY10 (10K-25K); FY11 (20K-40K); FY12 (20K- 40K). The Government reserves the right to exercise options up to the maximum  aggregate quantities available in the base period and the four option periods  without regard to the actual FY. The M762A1 ET Fuze and M762A1 ET Fuze S&A  Assemblies will be manufactured, inspected, assembled, packaged and delivered  in accordance with a Government Technical Data Packages (TDP) and applicable  contract requirements.  This procurement will be restricted to the National  Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB).  Numbered notes 13 and 26 are  applicable to this effort.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) exists for this  effort and may be obtained provided a Non-Disclosure Form is signed and on  file.  The Non-Disclosure Agreement may be obtained via e-mail by sending a  request electronically to Peter Vincenti, Contract Specialist, at  peter.vincenti@us.army.mil or by calling 973-724-5368.   Interested offerors  may also obtain a copy of the uncertified TDP upon request.  A DD2345 must  also be submitted prior to receiving the TDP package (CD).

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Digital Linear Tape (DLT) is one of several technologies developed to increase data transfer rates and storage capacities of computer tape drives. SDLT, an upgraded variant of DLT technology, makes it possible to store more than 100 GB on a single cartridge with data transfer speeds of up to 10 MB per second.  SDLT drives are currently deployed to posts.    The SDLT 160/320 is the second tape drive released in the SDLT family, offering a 45% increase in native storage capacity and performance as compared to the SDLT 110/220 GB tape drive. With its improvements in capacity and performance, the SDLT 160/320 GB tape drive is positioned as the fastest and highest capacity tape drive in the mid-range drive segment. Backward read compatible with DLT Type IV media, the SDLT 160/320 maintains the SDLT compatibility standards introduced on the SDLT 110/220 while adding read compatibility for media written in the DLT1 and DLT VS 40/80 format. SDLT 160/320 GB Tape Drive Customer benefits include: ý	160 GB per cartridge capacity requires fewer data cartridges for backups, reducing the customers total cost of ownership ý	57.6 GB/hour performance reduces the customers backup window by 33% or more as compared to other competitive technologies ý	Investment protection through backward-read compatibility with previously written DLT Type IV and SDLT media ý	Increased reliability and performance through technological advances in drive head and media design ý	Reduces dependence on spares inventory with a 24-hour exchange ý	SDLT technology roadmap offers future capacities beyond 1TB per cartridge<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. CA/CST has selected the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Tape Drive because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý tape drives indicated that this is the only tape drive that meets the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested SDLT tape drives will be deployed at overseas posts which has established an environment comprised of equipment that is compatible with the Quantum SDLT 320 tape drive.  The continued use of the SDLT tape drive eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturersý server configurations. Most importantly, the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Drive is currently the only tape drive available that meets CAýs requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive without delay.<BR><BR>

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>Support Contract Number: 32102<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an ýout-of-the-boxý solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ý	Conducting development efforts ý	Testing developed products ý	Compatibility testing ý	Use case scenario testing ý	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ý	Training ý	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the systemýs current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ý	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ý	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DOýs Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities.  The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements: ý	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications.  ý	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes. ý	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies. ý	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale). In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsý Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-4340C Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner to support Consular posts overseas.  The Fujitsu fi-4340C is a high-speed color capable scanner with top speed of 40 sheets per minute or 80 (when scanning both sides of each sheet) page images per minute.   It operates at approximately twice the speed of the previously reviewed fi-4220C.  The product complies and is able to operate within Consular Affairs (CA) Modernized Systems architecture.  This scanner meets specific requirements for CA Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) applications.  It is also suitable for use with other CA applications.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Fujitsu FI-4340C Scanners without delay. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. The choice to use the FI-4340C as opposed to other document scanners available is that CA/CST/CS has acquired and fielded several hundred of these scanners since its inception in 2002.  The FI-4340C offers more features and is more robust than other scanners in this price range.  The continued use of Fujitsu scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  Furthermore, no additional training to those handling the scanner is necessary with the continued use of this scanner.   In addition, the document scanners require customized software.  Because the proprietary Consular applications (NIV, IVO, ACS+, and INK) have been developed to work with this specific document scanner, it is most cost effective to continue to use the Fujitsu FI-4340C rather than introduce another manufacturerýs product.  Another manufacturerýs product will require redesigning the CA applications.  CA/CST has selected the Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The Fujitsu FI-4340C scanner has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsý Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.

<DESC>The government has received the following 2 questions and is providing responses to those questions as follows:  Q1.         What is the government?s intent behind the ?pricing model with associated billing detail? cited in Section 4. of ?TheRSSAggregationSyndicationSOW.doc? document?  A1. The government must understand how the price it will pay for the service is calculated.  Examples: 
Software is often priced based on users, or CPUs engaged in its use.   
Software as a service, in our research, could be priced in multiple ways, as well.  Base plus volume; Volume only;  Base plus volume plus service;  Base plus volume plus professional services plus maintenance; etc.  
Offerors should strive to provide the government with sufficient information to project its costs of the service as it grows in use.  Q2.  Do the cover page and table of contents count towards the 15 page requirement specified in the RFP?  A2.  No, the cover page and the table of contents will not count in the 15 page requirement specified in the RFP.  

The due date for receipt of proposals remains March 17, 2008, 2 PM EST.

<DESC>NOTE:  The Pre-Solicitation Notice dated Jun 8, 2007 is changed as follows:

1.  Delete paragraph 2A.
2.  Add the following:  2A.  Experience in Providing Design & Construction Services on Comparable Projects.  As a minimum, provide documentation evidencing offeror?s past experience on at least five (5) projects completed or in progress within the last ten (10) years that collectively best describe members of proposed D/B team experience providing design and construction services on projects with characteristics as comparable as possible to subject project (i.e., ?Bridging? project delivery; design/build delivery; adaptive re-use of existing building; historic rehabilitation; tight, urban sites; costs in excess of $20 million; LEED certified, BIM, etc.) 

Below is the minutes from the Pre-Solicitation Meeting held June 20, 2007.

On June 20, 2007 the General Services Administration conducted a Pre-Solicitation Notice Pre-Proposal Meeting for firms interested in responding to the pre-solicitation notice.  An overview of the information presented at this meeting is:

?	Bill Clark with Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow, the Bridging Architect, presented the general concept design of the project outlining the project scope and the design principles utilized in the development of the Bridging Contract Documents.
?	Buddy Hill, the General Services Administration Project Manager, reviewed the use of BIM (Building Information Modelling) to-date on the project, emphasized that GSA is a leader in the advancement of BIM and encouraged all proposers to utilize BIM to the extent technically and economically appropriate in the eventual development of the construction documents.  The selected design-builder will be provided with the Bridging Contract Documents in their native electronic form (either Revit or AutoCAD 2-D) for validation by the selected design-builder and the selected design-builder may elect to accept the work as their own or to develop their own electronic files.
?	Buddy Hill highlighted that the project will be registered with the U.S. Green Building Council and that it is a project goal to minimally-achieve a ?Silver? certification by USGBC.  The Bridging Contract Documents have been developed to allow the selected design-builder with flexibility in the way in which Silver certification points are accumulated, but it will be the responsibility of the design-builder to ensure that the project is executed and documented in a manner which will enable Silver certification.  Brookwood Program Management will administer the LEED submission process.
?	Buddy Hill provided an overview of the scope of the separate demolition and abatement contract which will be awarded during the month of June, 2007.  The design-build contract scope of work will be based upon a structural shell.
?	Glenda Burns, the General Services Administration Contracting Officer, reviewed the Advisory Multi-Step procurement process and offered the following clarifications to the Pre-Solicitation Notice:
1.	Section 2.A. of the ?Experience? section of the Technical Qualifications to be submitted by proposers will be changed.  (see above)
2.	The Technical Evaluation factors for the Phase II evaluation will include: 1) the Project Management Approach, 2) Qualifications and experience of Key Personnel, 3) Experience and 4) Past Performance.  The Price submitted as a part of the response to the Request for Proposal will be more important than the technical qualifications.
3.	In order to submit a response to the Request for Proposal, firms are REQUIRED to submit a response to the Pre-Solicitation Notification.

The following questions were addressed at the Pre-Proposal Meeting:
Q1. Has a construction start date been established for the project?
A1.	As a part of the Management Plan to be prepared in response to the Request for Proposal, proposers will provide a schedule for design and construction of the project.  GSA anticipates that an award of the design-build contract will be made in early November, 2007.  There will be no ?fast-tracking? of the project (i.e. no limited release on construction procurement or work prior to GSA?s acceptance of the completed construction documents from the design-builder.  GSA currently anticipates a start of construction in Q1 or Q2 2008.  GSA has flexibility in both the start and completion dates of construction.

Q2.	Can any of the structural work be performed prior to the design being complete?
A2.	No.  The Bridging Contract Documents will provide that the design-builder submit the construction documents in three phases for the purpose of GSA satisfying themselves that the construction documents are being developed in accordance with the requirements of the Bridging Contract Documents.  Upon completion of the final construction documents review, GSA will either exercise its contract option for the design-builder to proceed with construction or GSA may elect to pay the design-builder for the services rendered, take ownership of the construction documents, and procure the construction through other means.

    Q3.	Is a schedule to be provided as a part of the response to the RFP?
A3.	Yes ? See Answer 1.  GSA will provide proposers with the anticipated durations for construction document review to be incorporated into the project schedule within the Request for Proposal.

    Q4.	When will the Bridging Contract Documents be available?
A4.	The Bridging Contract Documents will be provided to all proposers following GSA?s receipt of an agreement from each proposer to secure all documents as ?Sensitive But Unclassified Documents.? GSA currently anticipates that the Request for Proposal (and the Bridging Contract Documents) will be issued in early August, 2007.

    Q5.	How much information is available about the existing building?
A5.	S&WS&N completed an as-built evaluation of the existing buildings, including an evaluation of the structural capacity of the load-bearing masonry/heavy timber construction, and this evaluation material will be provided ?for reference? with the Request for Proposal.  GSA will also provide survey information, geotechnical reports and other evaluative materials as reference documents.

Q6.	At the Industry Forum, a separate ?BA-54 Project? was discussed.  What is the status of that project?
A6.	The BA-54 project is renovation work required to the basement of the Elbert P. Tuttle Building to permit the relocation of mechanical equipment for the Tuttle Annex and to allow connection of the tunnel to be constructed under the Annex (BA-55) project with the Tuttle Building elevator and stairs.  Renovation work is funded separately from Major Capital work and, due to the separate funding sources, separate contracts are required.  However, the BA-54 work and BA-55 work will be awarded to the same design-builder.  The Requests for Proposal will include separate Bridging Contract Documents for each project.

Q7.	 Can the 90% complete Bridging Contract Documents be made available for review at a time and place different from the Pre-Solicitation Pre-Proposal Meeting?
A7.	The 90% Bridging Contract Documents can be reviewed at the offices of Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow at a mutually convenient time during the month of June to be arranged by contacting Bill Clark at bclark@sw-sn.com or 404.521.6202.

    Q8.	Can the buildings be photographed?
A8.	The exteriors of the Annex buildings can be photographed.  Federal security maintains a presence on Fairlie Street and you are advised to notify the officers on-site as to why you are photographing the buildings.  Since it is an operating federal courthouse, you are discouraged from photographing the Tuttle Building.

Q9.	Will the attendance sheet from the Pre-Solicitation Pre-Proposal Meeting be distributed?
	A9.	Yes.  It is attached to this Amendment.

    Q10.Are there any restrictions on the architectural and engineering firms who can be engaged as a part of the design-builder?s proposed team?
A10.	Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow and their consultants may not be a part of a design-builder?s team.  In addition to S&WS&N, those firms are:
IdeaSpan, Herrington Associates, Newcomb & Boyd (for security and data/voice engineering only), Hinman Associates, Costing Services Group, Elevator Advisors, Inc., B&E Jackson, BVM Engineering, L.F. Saussy and Environmental Graphics
Additionally, the following consulting engineering firms have been retained by Brookwood Program Management and are ineligible to participate as a part of a design-build team:
EDT, Inc., CFP Group, National Building Contractors, Commissioning and Green Building Solutions (CxGBS), and Diversified Environmental Management.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) acting through the Department of the Navy is issuing this request for information (RFI) seeking information from entities with experience in developing, constructing, operating and maintaining power plants, that would be interested in developing facilities on Naval Station Pearl Harbor, to provide power to Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Hawaii; and Navy Exchange); 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam Air Force Base; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay (MCBH), all on the island of Oahu. The combined baseload of all these bases is approximately 113 MW (100 MW for Naval Station Pearl Harbor and immediately adjacent Hickam Air Force Base; 13 MW for MCBH).  It is the desire of DOD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal entity or entities to provide baseload power to both locations (Naval Station Pearl Harbor/Hickam Air Force Base and MCBH).  Ideally, the plant(s) would allow islanding of the distribution network serving these facilities and continuing power supply to them in case of a potential power outage by the utility company to provide energy security to both bases.  There is also interest in reducing our current electricity costs.  The 2007 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to obtain not less than 25 percent of the total quantity of electric energy it consumes during fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter from renewable energy sources. Specifically, DOD desires to acquire electric power generated from alternative and renewable fuel sources and renewable energy sources, as defined in Executive Order 13423.  The current requirement is for all generation to be produced on the military installation.   DOD?s desire is to purchase power without acquiring or retaining ownership interest or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets (other than in the underlying land).  DOD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or other contract vehicles.  DOD may also consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government. Finally, it is the DOD?s intent to purchase power at rates lower than rates it is currently being charged for power purchased for the bases involved and at comparable levels of power quality and reliability. DOD is also interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with awarding a contract(s) for the procurement of power, including, but not limited to, awarding a contract within a timeframe where current Federal and State tax credits can be applied. Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs, also known as green tags, renewable energy credits, or tradable renewable certificates) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder believes should be brought to the attention of DOD.  Respondents are also encouraged to comment about potential cost implications if the RECs from a project are not retained by DOD but sold by the developer. DOD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power from such plant(s) to parties other than DOD is desirable and/or feasible consistent with current and pending Federal and State utility laws, regulations, and procedures.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation and other assets would be envisioned, and what acreage of land or rights-of-way would need to be developed.  Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder believes should be brought to the attention of DOD. DOD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a distributed generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.  It is the DOD?s intent with this RFI to receive industry input as indicated in the attached Statement of Interest Questionnaire.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired. FAR ? 52.215-3 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) 	(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 	(b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. 	(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of gathering information and planning future solicitations.  All information submitted will be considered proprietary and for official government use only.  Interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions accordingly.  The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages.  The Questionnaire should be submitted either via e-mail to mark.asato@navy.mil or to the following address: NAVFAC Pacific, ACQ22 258 Makalapa Drive Suite 100 Pearl Harbor, HI, 96860-3134

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) acting through the Department of the Navy is issuing this request for information (RFI) requesting information from entities with experience in developing wind power farms, regarding the potential for developing a wind power farm (or farms) and transmitting the power to DOD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The possible DOD installations at which such power might be used include, but are not limited to: Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes to Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Security Group Department, Kunia; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Activity Pacific; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Haw!  aii; and Navy Exchange); Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai; 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam AFB; Schofield Barracks; Fort Shafter; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii (includes MCBH Kaneohe Bay; and Camp Smith).  The list of DOD installations is not all inclusive; there may be other sites not listed.  The combined baseloads of all DOD installations on the island of Oahu is approximately 200 MW; on the island of Kauai, approximately 1.5 MW.  DOD is interested in the prospect of a non-federal entity owning, operating, and maintaining the wind power farm(s), as well as the transmission and distribution system to all installations served consistent with applicable State and Federal utility laws, regulations, and procedures.  DOD is also interested in reducing its current electricity costs.  The 2007 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to obtain not less than 25 percent of the total quantity of electric energy it consumes during fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter from renewable energy sources. It is the desire of DOD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal entity or entities.  The desire of DOD is to purchase power without any direct interest in the ownership or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets.  DOD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or other contract vehicle.  DOD may consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government.  Finally, it is the DOD?s intent to purchase power at rates lower than rates it is currently being charged for power purchased for the bases involved for power of comparable power quality and reliability.

Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs, also known as green tags, renewable energy credits, or tradable renewable certificates) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  DOD is also interested in the potential economic advantages it may receive in the form of reduced power costs if the RECs are not retained by DOD but sold by the project developer.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of DOD. DOD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to other parties other than DOD is either desirable and/or feasible given current and any pending Federal and State utility laws, regulations, and procedures and available capacity on current transmission lines or in current transmission corridors.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation and other assets would be envisioned, and what acreage of land and rights-of-way would be developed.  Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of DOD. DOD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a wind farm or distributed wind generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.

<DESC>The purpose of  Amendment 0001 to the Program Solicitation PS08-02 is to change the contract type contemplated for a FAR-based contract from Fixed-Price to Cost-reimbursement.  Offerors will propose a Cost-reimbursement type contract that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.   The agreement type contemplated for an OTA remains Fixed Price Payable Milestones. Offerors proposing an OT must submit a FAR-based Cost-reimbursement and OT proposal.  Offerors submitting only a FAR-based Cost-reimbursement proposal are not required to submit an OT proposal. The Cost submission has been revised to add clarity to the inclusion of subcontractors, and internal work transfers, IRAD investments and other programs leveraged for this demonstration, cost by each Phase, specific visibility at WBS levels across prime, basis of estimate guidance and administrative corrections. See the amendment for detailed changes.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334512   Amend 2:  The purpose of this modification is to post clarifications to this requirement and extend the due date for quotes until March 27, 2008, the last day for questions is March 19, 2008. The following clarifications are as follows: ?	Is the interference persistent  and stationary in nature or is it highly variable (an example being an interference signal that occurs in bursts or one that is always present but changes as a function of time)? The interference is variable.  There is always some background level of varying strength.  The effects upon the  microscope have been observed to be intermittent which demonstrates that the energy is varying, i.e it will sometimes be below the operational level for the instrument and sometimes (the majority of the time actually) it will be above that level.  The space is on the 6th floor of our building and  backs up to one of the electrical chases which gives off a persistent signal. The space is also surrounded by other equipment on two sides as well as the 5th and 7th floors which contribute to the EM noise. ?	Is the energy in the interference signal much higher, comparable to or lower than the  desired signal that is important for the operation of the SEM? As described above...yes. ?	How much latency can your system tolerate that may be caused by the interference suppression solution? This is outside of our expertise so we hesitate to comment on this specification.  We would like to  see the instrument operating to the limit of the parameters as designated by the manufacture.  At present we are generally well below this level of performance.  The microscope is a JEOL JEM 6490LV with a Tungsten filament.  The operating specifications may be obtained through JEOL.  Our contact is  John Dombrowski at 724.776.3711  Amend. 1:  The purpose of this modification is to identify the Request for Quote number which is RFQ-OH-08-00045.  All other terms and conditions shall remain the same. Combined Solicitation/Synopsis Electromagnetic Field Compensation System This is a combined  synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

QUESTION: I assume the wage/benefit requirements apply to our FT salaried aides and do not apply to per diem, intermittent workers. Is that correct? ANSWER:   29 CFR 4.176 - Payment of Fringe Benefits to Temporary and Part-Time Employees, states:  ". . . the Act makes no distinction, with respect to its compensation provisions, between temporary, part-time, and full-time employees. Accordingly, in the absence of express limitations, the provisions of an applicable fringe benefit determination apply to all temporary and part-time service employees  engaged in covered work. However, in general, such temporary and part-time employees are only entitled to an amount of the fringe benefits specified in an applicable determination which is proportionate to the amount of time spent in covered work."

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Geology Division, Geologic Hazards Team, has a requirement to support the operation of seismic networks within the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).  The ANSS seismic networks use software to acquire, process and distribute seismic waveform data and earthquake information. The services will be on an as-needed basis for the performance of such tasks as installation, configuration, enhancement, operation, and problem-solving for nine IT products used to operate the ANSS. The nine IT products to be supported are:  (1) CISN Display, (2) Seis/NetWatch, (3) Earthworm, (4) Earthquake Information Distribution System (EIDS), (5) INV (Inventory/Response), (6) SHAPE, (7) XYZ, (8) AUTODRM, and (9) CISN Earthquake Processing System Software.  1.  CISN Display was developed by Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc (ISTI) for California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN).  The source code for CISN is not publically available.  CISN will permit the USGS to use the code and will allow ISTI to enhance it.  2.  SeisNetWatch was developed by ISTI.  3.  Earthworm was developed by the USGS with ISTI working under contract to enhance it and to serve as a repository for resulting code.  4.  EIDS was developed by ISTI.  5.  INV (Inventory/Repsonse) was developed by the USGS with ISTI under contract to support, enhance, and problem-solve its features.  6.  SHAPE is a product developed by ISTI.  7. XYZ was developed by ISTI.  8.  AUTODRM is a proprietary product of ISTI.  9.  CISN Earthquake Processing System was developed by the CISN with ISTI's involvement.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance 51 USC 253 (c)(1), and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the support services specified as a sole source from Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc (ISTI),  70 Cereus Way, New Paltz, New York 12561, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Concerns that think they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required services stated herein.  Of particular interest would be the concern's ability to access all necessary software code.  This information will be evaluated based upon the criteria herein and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request and will not be considered further.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This neither constitutes a Request for Proposal nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. This is not a request for a proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to operate and maintain the Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) performed primarily at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB). This requirement is for on-site calibration, repair and maintenance support of various test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) in Colorado and Wyoming.   

The 21st Contracting Squadron at PAFB Colorado seeks potential sources to provide PMEL operations during normal duty hours and 24-hours-a-day during natural disasters or crises. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to perform metrology services and repair as needed of TMDE at Government-owned laboratories with Government-furnished calibration equipment and standards. Operations of the laboratory include gaining and maintaining certification by the Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program.

The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued in the future and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Government anticipates italicizing a best value source selection to award a firm, fixed price (FFP) contract for a basic year of performance (1 Mar 09 through 28 Feb 10) with four one-year options. The subsequent contract is also anticipated to include up to a month phase-in period (Feb 09). The current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost-reimbursable logistics CLIN.  

Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates to any and all documents.  

All potential offerors are reminded, that in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), that lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

<RESPDATE>040308
<ARCHDATE>05032008
<CONTACT>The Contract Specialist is Michael Dixon and he can be reached at michael.d.dixon@usmc.mil.
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking sources for a supplier of a Ruggedized Universal Ski (RUnS) System.  The RUnS System includes the skis, the ski poles, and the ski repair kits.  This supplier must comply with the Buy American Act.  The purpose of the RUnS System is to provide the Marine Corps with a new short, lightweight (one size fits most) ski, which allows for quick movement across glaciers and snowfields during combat operations and training.  The RUnS System will replace the current USMC skis (NATO Asnes Ski) and the standard ski poles.  The required characteristics are as follows: (1) The new functional Ruggedized Universal Ski must fall between 155cm and 165cm.  A 10% variance in ski length is acceptable provided the changed length is substantiated by increased mobility, durability, and overall effectiveness.  (2) The tip, waist, and tail should be within a 10% variation of the following dimensions to allow for maximum mobility and flo!  atation: 130mm tip, 95mm waist, and 120mm tail, respectively.  (3) The ski must possess the capability for attaching a 3-hole mounting attachment for a universal binding system.  The 3-hole mounting area on each ski requires metal reinforcement to prevent damage to the ski should the attachment screws be torn from the ski.  (4) The skis must have metal edges.  (5) The skis must be waxless and the bottom must be made as a ?fish scale?-type design.  The primary design and use of this ski will be for the novice Marine skier.  (6) The ski must be capable of supporting the use of detachable climbing skins.  (7) The ski shall be constructed of a light-weight, durable material that can perform during dry or wet snow conditions to allow the skier control to traverse in icy conditions.  (8) The ski must provide good floatation in deep snow conditions while carrying the required equipment as designated for the mission.  The weight of a Marine on skis, with equipment, could reach weig!  hts in the range of 250lbs.  (9) The ski must function in wet/cold/ext reme weather temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to -40 degrees Fahrenheit.  (10) The ski must provide excellent cambering ability to perform with the weight of a combat loaded Marine (ranging from 250+ lbs.).  (11) The ski must be capable to be used with a standard type Emergency Casualty Evacuation (CASVAC) sled, such as, the Brooks-Range, Mountaineering Rescue Sled.  (12) Each ski must have a 3/8? hole drilled within 3/4? from the tip of the ski, centered between the sides of the ski tip.   The RUnS must be compatible for use with the Military Universal Binding made by Karhu/K2, Part No. BOM #2A0011.  The binding is designed with a 75mm, box toe front (or similar), and contains a 3-hole mounting system, using course thread philip screws, to mount the binding to the new ski.  As noted in (3) above, each ski requires metal reinforcement where the binding attaches to the ski.  The universal binding is a one size fits all across the mountain/cold weather boot spectrum, to include over boots.   The ski poles required must be adjustable and will be used to assist Marines with turning, manuvering, or climbing while skiing.  The poles must also be capable of being used during movement on snowshoe or foot when required to manuver through restricted, snow-covered, mountainous and open terrain.  The poles must be lightweight, durable, adjustable, un-bending, and must incorporate the latest technology allowing them to absorb shock.  They must be white in color with a black non-slip handle and made with a detachable bottom (basket) allowing the pole to serve as an avalanche probe.  The basket should be removeable and work in light or deep snow.  The adjustable pole must easily adjust from 32 inches in length (80 centimeters) up to 56 inches in length (140 cenimeters).   The Ski Repair Kit shall consist of the necessary tools, materials, and instructions for the user to provide ?limited, in-the-field/on-the-move? repairs as required.  Each Ski Repair Kit will be comprised of the items required to make minor repairs to the skis, bindings, and/or ski poles, thus allowing the skier or team to continue its mission.   Firms who believe they have a product capable of meeting this requirement must provide product literature, brochures, specification sheets, prior experience in this type of effort, and production capacity estimates directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  In addition, firms must also submit their company size, the place of manufacture, and any other relevant information.  Responses shall be submitted no later than 03 April 2008 to MARCORSYSCOM, Contracts ? PG-16 (CT 023), Attn: Michael Dixon, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Virginia 22134-6050.  Information may also be submitted via email to michael.d.dixon@usmc.mil.  Responses shall be limited to 20 pages (not including product literature and brochures).  Submitted information will not be returned. This is not a request for proposal or quotation.  No solicitation document exists. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these items, nor does the Marine Corps intend t!  o award on the basis of this sources sought or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) acting through the Department of the Navy is issuing this request for information (RFI) seeking information from entities with experience in developing, constructing, operating and maintaining power plants, that would be interested in developing facilities on Naval Station Pearl Harbor, to provide power to Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Hawaii; and Navy Exchange); 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam Air Force Base; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay (MCBH), all on the island of Oahu. The combined baseload of all these bases is approximately 113 MW (100 MW for Naval Station Pearl Harbor and immediately adjacent Hickam Air Force Base; 13 MW for MCBH).  It is the desire of DOD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal entity or entities to provide baseload power to both locations (Naval Station Pearl Harbor/Hickam Air Force Base and MCBH).  Ideally, the plant(s) would allow islanding of the distribution network serving these facilities and continuing power supply to them in case of a potential power outage by the utility company to provide energy security to both bases.  There is also interest in reducing our current electricity costs.  The 2007 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to obtain not less than 25 percent of the total quantity of electric energy it consumes during fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter from renewable energy sources. Specifically, DOD desires to acquire electric power generated from alternative and renewable fuel sources and renewable energy sources, as defined in Executive Order 13423.  The current requirement is for all generation to be produced on the military installation.   DOD?s desire is to purchase power without acquiring or retaining ownership interest or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets (other than in the underlying land).  DOD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or other contract vehicles.  DOD may also consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government. Finally, it is the DOD?s intent to purchase power at rates lower than rates it is currently being charged for power purchased for the bases involved and at comparable levels of power quality and reliability. DOD is also interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with awarding a contract(s) for the procurement of power, including, but not limited to, awarding a contract within a timeframe where current Federal and State tax credits can be applied. Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs, also known as green tags, renewable energy credits, or tradable renewable certificates) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder believes should be brought to the attention of DOD.  Respondents are also encouraged to comment about potential cost implications if the RECs from a project are not retained by DOD but sold by the developer. DOD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power from such plant(s) to parties other than DOD is desirable and/or feasible consistent with current and pending Federal and State utility laws, regulations, and procedures.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation and other assets would be envisioned, and what acreage of land or rights-of-way would need to be developed.  Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder believes should be brought to the attention of DOD. DOD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a distributed generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.  It is the DOD?s intent with this RFI to receive industry input as indicated in the attached Statement of Interest Questionnaire.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired. FAR ? 52.215-3 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) 	(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 	(b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. 	(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of gathering information and planning future solicitations.  All information submitted will be considered proprietary and for official government use only.  Interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions accordingly.  The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages.  The Questionnaire should be submitted either via e-mail to mark.asato@navy.mil or to the following address: NAVFAC Pacific, ACQ22 258 Makalapa Drive Suite 100 Pearl Harbor, HI, 96860-3134

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) acting through the Department of the Navy is issuing this request for information (RFI) requesting information from entities with experience in developing wind power farms, regarding the potential for developing a wind power farm (or farms) and transmitting the power to DOD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The possible DOD installations at which such power might be used include, but are not limited to: Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes to Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Security Group Department, Kunia; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Activity Pacific; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Haw!  aii; and Navy Exchange); Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai; 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam AFB; Schofield Barracks; Fort Shafter; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii (includes MCBH Kaneohe Bay; and Camp Smith).  The list of DOD installations is not all inclusive; there may be other sites not listed.  The combined baseloads of all DOD installations on the island of Oahu is approximately 200 MW; on the island of Kauai, approximately 1.5 MW.  DOD is interested in the prospect of a non-federal entity owning, operating, and maintaining the wind power farm(s), as well as the transmission and distribution system to all installations served consistent with applicable State and Federal utility laws, regulations, and procedures.  DOD is also interested in reducing its current electricity costs.  The 2007 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to obtain not less than 25 percent of the total quantity of electric energy it consumes during fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter from renewable energy sources.

Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs, also known as green tags, renewable energy credits, or tradable renewable certificates) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  DOD is also interested in the potential economic advantages it may receive in the form of reduced power costs if the RECs are not retained by DOD but sold by the project developer.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of DOD. DOD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to other parties other than DOD is either desirable and/or feasible given current and any pending Federal and State utility laws, regulations, and procedures and available capacity on current transmission lines or in current transmission corridors.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation and other assets would be envisioned, and what acreage of land and rights-of-way would be developed.  Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of DOD. DOD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a wind farm or distributed wind generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) New Science Investigations using Existing NASA Spacecraft Science Mission Directorate, NASA Solicitation Number: NNH08ZDA005L Release Date: March 14, 2008 Response Date: April 9, 2008 NASA?s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) currently sponsors approximately 85 flight missions, involving over 90 spacecraft, divided between missions in development and missions in operations. One of SMD?s programmatic objectives is to maximize the science return for the Nation within the available budget. This Request for Information (RFI) solicits input from the broad space science community that would contribute to NASA?s study of possible new uses for current NASA spacecraft beyond their current missions. Responses to this RFI (NNH08ZDA005L) will be used to inform NASA?s program planning. Background: NASA has science missions under development and in operation that send spacecraft throughout the Solar System, including low and high Earth orbits, station keeping near Sun-Earth Lagrangian points, orbits around every planet from Mercury to Saturn as well as the Moon and asteroids, drift away Solar orbits, and trajectories out of the Solar System and into interstellar space. Each of these missions has science objectives that will be realized through a prime mission and possible mission extensions when the prime mission has been completed. NASA?s science missions are managed by the Science Mission Directorate (SMD); information on these missions may be found at http://science.hq.nasa.gov/missions/   . It is a programmatic objective of SMD to get more science return from the available budget. One way of increasing the science return from NASA?s science missions is to continue operating the spacecraft after the prime mission has been completed. NASA has a biennial review process, called the Senior Review, to consider and approve the operation of spacecraft and extend the prime science mission. An alternative to extending the prime science mission is to initiate a new science investigation with an existing spacecraft after the prime science mission has been completed. There have been several examples of this in the past, including the 1982 approval to use the ISEE-3 spacecraft (renamed ICE) for an encounter with Comet Giacobini-Zinner and the 2007 approval to use the Deep Impact spacecraft (renamed EPOXI) for a study of extrasolar planets during its cruise to encounter Comet Hartley 2. These new science investigations realized unique, high impact investigations that otherwise would cost substantially more to execute, and they provided high science value for the funds expended. In this RFI, NASA is soliciting ideas and suggestions from the science and research communities on potential new uses of existing NASA science spacecraft that support NASA?s science goals. A new science investigation using an existing spacecraft should address one or more of NASA?s science objectives in any of SMD?s research disciplines (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science). NASA?s science objectives are described in The Science Plan for NASA?s Science Mission Directorate (2007-2016), available at http://science.hq.nasa.gov/strategy/	 .  In addition to using an existing spacecraft (or multiple spacecraft) for a new mission in the same research discipline as the one it was designed for, such as retargeting a planetary science mission to a new destination or flying a multi-spacecraft heliophysics mission in a new constellation, this request specifically includes the use of existing spacecraft with prime missions in one research discipline for a new science investigation in a different research discipline. This could include, but is not limited to, the use of astrophysics spacecraft for Earth observations, the use of planetary science spacecraft for heliophysics measurements or astrophysics observations, or the use of Earth science spacecraft to study the Moon. It is not the intent of this RFI to solicit observation requests, i.e. relatively modest changes such as a single observation using an existing spacecraft for a short period of time, but instead to solicit major and entirely new applications for existing spacecraft. With input from responses to this RFI, NASA intends to consider (i) whether there are science opportunities for new uses of existing spacecraft and (ii) whether a solicitation for proposals is warranted to enable such opportunities. Instructions for Response: The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA's NSPIRES system. The response should not exceed four pages in length. NASA is soliciting information that might be used by NASA to facilitate planning for new uses of existing spacecraft.  Material in a RFI response is confidential, nonbinding on the respondent, and will be used by NASA for information and planning purposes only. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. No proposals will be awarded funding as a result of this RFI. The complete RFI including background, requested information, and instructions for responding may be found at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	 (select "Solicitations" then "Open  Solicitations" then "Request for Information (NNH08ZDA005L): New Science Investigations using Existing NASA Spacecraft"). Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than April 9, 2008. For further information on this RFI, please contact Dr. Paul Hertz, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; email at paul.hertz@nasa.gov.

Description of Items:  The Cobalt Blue ? Trainers (CBT) are 1:1 scale replicas of the AR-15/M16 style rifles, carbines and their variants that look, feel and operate like a full-functioning  firearm, but do not and cannot be made to fire live ammunition.  Barrels are drilled with a .212 size bore and no chamber.  Bolt carriers will not accept standard bolts. Lower receivers have no hammer and a larger hole has been drilled so the standard hole can not be drilled for a hammer.  The trigger hole is moved out of place, making it near impossible to ever make the lower function for live fire.  The pockets for the other fire control components in the lower receivers are absent or are an alternate dimension. Quantity Required: 400 each with delivery to Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama 36112.  Vendor must provide all labor, tools and supplies necessary to provide this requirement.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Nucleic Acid Assays for the Detection of Viral Animal Pathogens
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Nucleic Acid Assays for the Detection of 
Viral Animal Pathogens

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license nucleic acid assays for the detection of viral animal pathogens such as bluetongue virus (BTV), bovine herpesvirus (BHV), vesicular stomatitis, etc. 

Background: The agricultural industry accounts for a large percentage of the gross domestic product. The early detection of viral diseases affecting livestock is critical to minimizing their spread and overall economic impact. 

Description:  The invention covers nucleic acid-based kits and methods for the detection of viruses of significant importance to agricultural livestock and wildlife, such as bluetongue virus (BTV), bovine herpesvirus (BHV), vesicular stomatitis, etc.
?	Each signature is comprised of a forward primer, reverse primer and a probe. The assays are compatible with real-time fluorescence detection (e.g. Taqman) and multiplexed array formats (e.g. Luminex). 
?	The intended sample matrix detection is whole blood, but tissue samples or insects that serve as vectors may also be used. 
?	The signatures could be used individually or as a set. 

Advantages:  
?	The existing tests for bluetongue virus on the market are immunoassay-based and detect the presence of antibodies raised in response to infection by bluetongue virus. LLNL has developed PCR-based assays that detect the presence of viral nucleic acids in a sample with high sensitivity and specificity.
?	LLNL has unique signatures which can detect and differentiate viruses from genetically similar near-neighbors (e.g. BTV from Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (EHDV)) and other likely confounders. 
 

Potential Applications:  Utilizing LLNL?s unique signatures, licensee could manufacture reagent test kits for diagnosis of diseases such as bluetongue virus (BTV), bovine herpesvirus (BHV), vesicular stomatitis, etc. 

Development Status:  LLNL has developed nucleic acid assays for bluetongue virus bovine herpesvirus, vesicular stomatitis and others. LLNL is currently filing patent applications on nucleic acid assays for the detection of bluetongue virus, bovine herpesvirus, vesicular stomatitis and other viruses that are of significant importance to agriculture.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPO website at http://ipo.llnl.gov/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL?s Nucleic Assays for the Detection of Viral Animal Pathogens should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>--IKE 504 with military kitset
<DESC>The previously posted notice posted on 27 Feb 2008, is changed to include the following updated description:<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of engineers, Mobile District, intends to award a sole source, commercial items contract for the purchase of twelv e IKE 504 geospatial assessment tools with military kitsets. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the Government has determined that Science Applications International Corporation, 7125 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, MD 21046-2552, is the only responsible so urce for this requirement. The Government intends to award a contract by 24 March 2008. This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can furnish the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and p rovide written notification to the Contracting Officer within three days from the date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. SAIC, in conjunction with S urveylab, has developed the ike 504, a secure chip Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module SAASM version of the current ike 305 hand-held Geographic Information System GIS Capture device. The ike relies on internal GIS software ESRI's ArcPad to seamles sly record and create real-time survey data into shapefiles. The current ike 305 continures to be the only hand-held GIS related device that incorporates a Global Positioning Satellite receiver; digital camera; inclinometer; compass; and a laser designator  capable of lasing a target up to 1000 meters and getting the associated geo-location information all in one hand-held unit. All sensor devices are internal to the ike, thus no attachments are required. The ike 504 expands upon this uniqueness by incorpora ting the SAASM chip into the ike 305. The SAASM chip, developed by Rockwell-Collins, and controlled by the NAVSTAR GPS-Joint Program Office JPO, uses state-of-the-art security architecture mandated by the DoD for all new GPS systems. The SAASM-based GPS re ceiver is treated with a tamper-resistant coating to ensure safeguarding  of classified military GPS data. The SAASM based receiver is the only receiver that is unclassified when keyed with Selective Availability. Additionally, the unclassified SAASM recei ver maintains all secure information internally and provides only unclassified outputs, including the permitted point solution information. Specifications for the ike 504 are as follows: the specifications for the SAASM chip are classified and controlled b y Rockwell-Collins and DoD regulations.<BR><BR>Physical Size - 300mm x 110mm x 80mm<BR>Weight: 1200g<BR>Tripod Mount- Standard Camera 1/4<BR>Main Connector: Power/USB/RS232/RTCM<BR>External Antenna - TNC Female<BR>Touch Screen- Over LCD Display<BR>Buttons - 4 User Programmable<BR>Casing - Plastic/ABS + Polycarbonate<BR>Operating Temp- -10C to +40C<BR>Storage Temp - -15C to +60C<BR>Protection - IP65<BR>Battery - Internal rechargable Li-Polymer<BR>Operation Time - 6 to 8 hours<BR>DC Input - 11 to 17 VDC at1.5 A max<BR>Laser - Range 1000 meters/3,280 feet<BR>Accuracy - +-0.5mm/1.6ft + 0.5 per cent of range<BR>Wavelength - 905nm - invisible infrared<BR>Safety - Safe to the naked eye over any distance<BR>21.CFR1040.10 IEC60825-1:2001 Class 3R<BR>Display Screen Siz e - 3.5 inch diagonal<BR>Screen Resolution - 64k color transflective<BR>Viewable Image: 320x240<BR>Computer - Processor 624MHz Intel PXA270<BR>RAM- 64MB RAM<BR>Non-volatile System Memory - 128MB Flash ROM<BR>Non-volatile Storage Memory - Removable SD card 1GB<BR>Operating System - Microsoft Windows Mobile 5<BR>Communication - USB 1.1, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and RS232<BR>Digital Compass - Accuracy Tilt 0 to 30 degrees, 3.0 degrees RMS, Accuracy Tilt 30 to 60 degrees, 4.0 degrees RMS<BR>Inclinometer - Roll and Pitc h Range - +-60 degrees, Accuracy 0 degrees to 30 degrees, 0.4 degrees, Accuracy 30 degrees to 60 degrees, 1.0 degrees<BR>Digital Camera - 3.2 Mega Pixels 2048 x  1536; 24 bit color; Output image format, JPEG or Bitmap<BR>Software - Data Capture Applications, CSv file format; ArcPad Shapefile format, Desktop Synchronization - ikeSync<BR><BR> <BR>     <BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>A--DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED, VARIABLE SPEED REFUEL DROGUE
<DESC>This 18 Jan 2008 Amendment changes the anticipated RFP release date from  "to be determined" to 18 Jan 2008.  The PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE was first  posted on 20 DECEMBER 2007, and titled DEVELOPMENT OF VARIABLE SPEED,  VARIABLE DRAG REFUELING DROGUE (VSD/VDD).  The 14 January 2008 Amendment  added the following information to the VSD/VDD Demonstration: For the  purposes of the VSD/VDD Demonstration, a Safety of Flight Certificate is  defined as a signed statement from the company based on the data presented  in the safety of flight package and when operated to the defined  limitations their drogue is safe for flight. VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of  their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD)  candidate.  A potential offeror?s participation is strictly voluntary and  a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the government?s  future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the  government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides  not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in  the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a  tentative date and is subject to change. A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If  the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to  the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The  offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific  drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue  demonstration and no other. The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offeror?s safety  restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing  to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of  flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data,  flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical  interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be  responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the  existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror  will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the  configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The  government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on  complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that  will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified  condition. 2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing The offeror shall: Submit to the government (see below address) by COB 24 January 2008 the  following documents:    	(a) 	Flight safety certificates 	(b)	Flight instructions and limitations 	(c)	Pod modification or maintenance instructions 	(d)  Physical dimensions of collapsed drogue including diameter and  length 	(e)	Address: 	ASC/668 AESS 	1895 5th Street, Building 46 	WPAFB, OH 45433-7200 	Attn: Mr. John Shock Submit to the government (see below address) 7 days prior to the scheduled  ground/flight evaluation the following: 	(a)	Drogues (include spare drogue(s) if desired) 	(b)	Visit request if representative is attending in person 	(c)	Address:	413th  Flight Test Squadron 	320 Tully Street 	Bldg 90343 	Hurlburt Field, FL 	Attn: Mr. Jim O?Brien At government request be prepared to participate in the government Safety  Review Board. 3.0  Government Support of Flight Evaluation The government will provide: 	(a)	C-130 equipped with Sargent Fletcher 48000- 02/04 pods 	(b)	Test pilot and crew 	(c)	MA-2/3 refueling coupling interface 	(d)	Chase aircraft and crew 	(e)	Video and photography equipment 	(f)	Safety Review Board 	(g)	A brief test report and video of results This is a change to the reference pre-solicitation notice.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Digital Linear Tape (DLT) is one of several technologies developed to increase data transfer rates and storage capacities of computer tape drives. SDLT, an upgraded variant of DLT technology, makes it possible to store more than 100 GB on a single cartridge with data transfer speeds of up to 10 MB per second. SDLT drives are currently deployed to posts. The SDLT 160/320 is the second tape drive released in the SDLT family, offering a 45% increase in native storage capacity and performance as compared to the SDLT 110/220 GB tape drive. With its improvements in capacity and performance, the SDLT 160/320 GB tape drive is positioned as the fastest and highest capacity tape drive in the mid-range drive segment. Backward read compatible with DLT Type IV media, the SDLT 160/320 maintains the SDLT compatibility standards introduced on the SDLT 110/220 while adding read compatibility for media written in the DLT1 and DLT VS 40/80 format. SDLT 160/320 GB Tape Drive Customer benefits include: ý 160 GB per cartridge capacity requires fewer data cartridges for backups, reducing the customers total cost of ownership ý 57.6 GB/hour performance reduces the customers backup window by 33% or more as compared to other competitive technologies ý Investment protection through backward-read compatibility with previously written DLT Type IV and SDLT media ý Increased reliability and performance through technological advances in drive head and media design ý Reduces dependence on spares inventory with a 24-hour exchange ý SDLT technology roadmap offers future capacities beyond 1TB per cartridge<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. CA/CST has selected the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Tape Drive because results obtain by the Bureauýs System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersý tape drives indicated that this is the only tape drive that meets the DoSýs processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested SDLT tape drives will be deployed at overseas posts which has established an environment comprised of equipment that is compatible with the Quantum SDLT 320 tape drive. The continued use of the SDLT tape drive eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturersý server configurations. Most importantly, the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Drive is currently the only tape drive available that meets CAýs requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive without delay.<BR><BR>

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS

Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 29 (twenty-nine) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 450 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, April 3, 2008.

For this competitive, best value procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained.

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-       Holsteins;
-       castrated males;
-       healthy with no overt signs of disease;
-       free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-       polled or dehorned;
-       tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-       free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-       the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-       the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-       the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, April 3, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

We would like to emphasize the importance of and our necessity for healthy specimens. In particular, we are sensitive to and will reject any animal that carries or develops ringworm.

Please submit your responses before the deadline of 12:00 noon Eastern Time on Wednesday, March 26, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov or by fax to 631-323-3101. The successful offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

<DESC>Statement of Work - SOW Appraisal Services Directorate - ASD Agency Case & Number:  2008IDBLMID120 ARRTS Number:  #LD71MG (Federal Lands) and #LD71MH (Private Lands) MARKET STUDY FOR THE OWYHEE INITIATIVE: SECTION 1 - IDENTIFICATION & GENERAL INFORMATION BACKGROUND: The Owyhee Initiative (OI) is a consensus agreement reached by a number of national, regional, and local stakeholders to promote the ecological and economic health within Idaho's Owyhee County.  The agreement was crafted by local ranchers, county representatives, conservationists, outfitters, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe and others to address longstanding public lands issues in southwestern Idaho.   The agreement addresses concerns ranging from regulation of off-road vehicles, permanent protection of wilderness study areas, recognition of a traditional ranching way of life, and preservation of tribal culture and values.  While the OI agreement provides a framework for resolving these concerns, the Owyhee Initiative Implementation Act introduced by Sen. Crapo (R-ID) provides the necessary legal vehicle for implementing and enforcing the agreement.    Taken together, the OI agreement and OI Implementation Act achieves the following:   Designation of 517,000 acres of wilderness, including 55,000 acres of wilderness that will not be grazed by livestock.  Designation of 384 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers.  Closure of 200 miles of motorized trails in candidate wilderness areas and initiation of a travel planning process to establish a designated system of motorized routes for all public lands in Owyhee County.   Increased protections for Shoshone-Paiute cultural sites and resources.  Initiating of a county process to abandon all of its RS 2477 road claims in designated wilderness.  A commitment by those involved to seek support for research and conservation projects in Owyhee County.  Opening of closed roads across private land to provide better public access to public lands.  PURPOSE OF MARKET STUDY: The purpose of this Market Study is to assess the feasibility of a proposed land exchange between the Bureau of Land Management and private individual land owners.  Preliminary ranges of value estimates of lands involved in the proposal are needed by land (type, class)/highest and best use by ownership. The land values are to be looked at both "as is" and with the hypothetical condition that the proposed OI Implementation Act has passed and the designations contained therein are in place. The opinion to be developed in this consultation is whether or not the proposed wilderness and wild and scenic river designations would have a major impact on real property value in the impacted areas of Owyhee County. Client:  U.S. Department of Interior - Appraisal Services Directorate. Intended Users:  Appraisal Services Directorate and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Intended Use:  For use by Bureau of Land Management on behalf of the United States of America in analysis of the proposed Owyhee Initiative legislative action. The appraisal report is not intended for any other use. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION: The landscape within the wilderness proposal is diverse, ranging from river canyons over a thousand feet deep to vast expanses of sagebrush and grassland plateaus that provide habitat for sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, songbirds, raptors, and numerous rare plant species.  More than 230,000 acres of lands proposed for wilderness are upland plateaus and 224,000 acres are classified as low or moderate hills.   This high desert, sagebrush steppe habitat is not included in existing designated wilderness in Idaho and is generally underrepresented in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The river canyons in Owyhee County have been called the largest concentration of sheer-walled volcanic rhyolite and basalt canyons in the western United States.  Many of the canyons are more than 1,000 feet deep, nearly twice as deep as the Washington Monument is tall.  River enthusiasts come from around the country to challenge the famous white water rapids of these rivers.   Federal Lands:  There are 70 parcels with a total of 52,860 acres. The parcels are composed primarily of dry grazing tracts.  The grazing tracts are located in high mountain deserts areas, and lower elevation grazing. The topography is steep in some mapped areas and rolling to flat in other areas. Other possible descriptions could also include: Riparian/Creek frontage pasture/grazing areas, wet meadows, recreation.  Private Lands:  There are nine individual property owners and 22 parcels with a total of 5138 acres.  The parcels are located primarily along water (creek/rivers) frontages and canyon areas located in the high mountain desert areas of Owyhee County.  The topography is steep in some areas and rolling to flat in other areas. Other possible descriptions could also include: Dry grazing, Riparian/Creek frontage pasture/grazing areas, wet meadows, recreation.  Legal Description:  Legal descriptions for the public and private tracts are attached to this Statement of Work.   Ownership/Occupant:  Ownership is identified on the attached legal descriptions;  Larger Parcel Issues:  There will be no determination of larger parcels.  However, the appraiser should keep in mind likely larger parcel determinations in his/her selection of appropriate sales for the market study. Personal Property:  None Property Access:  An extraordinary assumption will be made that legal access is available to both the public lands and the private. CONTACT INFORMATION: ASD Thomas E. Dobbin-RPRA  Senior Appraiser and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) Northwest Region Appraisal Services Directorate Voice: (208) 373-3871 Fax: (208) 373-3859 Email address: Thomas_dobbin@blm.gov BLM Howard Hedrick, BLM, Special Assistant BLM Idaho State Office, Boise, ID 208.373.4010 Fax:  (208) 373-4005 Inspection Permission:  Permission to enter upon and inspect the property has been granted. Arrangements must be made with Howard Hedrick, BLM. Controversies/Issues:  The property and ownership information given in this statement of work pertaining to the Owyhee Initiative proposal is to be kept confidential. PROVIDED PROPERTY INFORMATION: The Appraiser shall be provided with electronic copies of maps and CD's displaying ownership boundaries and location of the properties.  GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates will be provided for each parcel. Individual tax assessment information is not required for the properties. Any requests for additional information must be made through the contact people listed in this SOW above. SECTION 2 - APPRAISAL REQUIREMENTS & INSTRUCTIONS Appraisal Standards:  USPAP Standard 4: Real Property Appraisal Consulting, Development and Standard 5: Real Property Appraisal Consulting, Reporting. The report will be completed in a Summary format. Market Value:  Market Value for BLM Land Exchanges:  The most probable price in cash, or terms equivalent to cash, that lands or interests in lands should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, where the buyer and seller each acts prudently and knowledgeably, and the price is not affected by undue influence. [43 CFR 2200.0-5(n)]  Property Interest:  The range of value should be concluded as if the properties are owned in fee simple. This would constitute an extraordinary assumption. No title information will be provided to the appraiser. Date of Value:  Synonymous with the date of last property inspection; which must be no later than 60 calendar days prior to the submission of the completed appraisal report, unless the appraiser receives written approval from the COR/COTR prior to preparation of the report. Extraordinary Assumptions:  The following extraordinary assumptions should be invoked in conducting this market study: (1) That the properties are owned in fee simple. (2) That legal access exists for all the properties.   (3) That adequate water is available for livestock on parcels where the highest and best use is determined to be for grazing. That adequate water is available if irrigation is used on any of the properties. Research into actual water rights that may or may not exist is not required. (4) That there is no contributory value existing from surface or subsurface mineral estates. An analysis for surface and subsurface mineral rights is not required. The Appraiser may not assume or invoke any additional extraordinary assumptions without documented written approval from the ASD Reviewer/COR. Hypothetical Conditions:  The follow hypothetical conditions should be invoked in conducting this market study: (1)  That here are no known improvements, however, if any are observed they should be noted in the report but are not to be included in the range of value conclusions. The exclusion of any noted improvements is an approved hypothetical condition. (2)  The ranges of value are to be developed for the private land classes both "as is" and "as if" the Owyhee Initiative Legislation has passed.  For the second condition, assuming that the legislation has passed is an approved hypothetical condition. The Appraiser may not assume or invoke any additional hypothetical conditions without documented written approval from the ASD Reviewer/COR. SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS: A.  Stratification of Results:  A total of six (6) Appraisal Map Zones for the Owyhee Initiative area have been established.  All six are displayed on the master map and each is individually detailed on its own separate map at a larger scale.  The maps include identification of the: - Private lands to be traded to BLM - A pool of public lands from which the ranchers will select in order to achieve an equal value exchange - Proposed Wilderness Designated Areas - Proposed Wild and Scenic Rivers Designations. The appraiser will determine the general land types or classes for the properties within each of the six (6) mapped areas based on recent sales of similar properties.  The appraiser will report a range of values for the determined land types or classes, for the properties, with in each to the six (6) mapped areas.  One section of the report will contain the analysis and range of recent sale prices for each land type or class determined without  the influence of the proposed Wilderness and Wild and Scenic River designations.  (Sales that are located in areas without designated wilderness and/or wild and scenic rivers.) Another section of the report will contain the analysis and value ranges for each land type or class determined as if the proposed Wilderness and Wild and Scenic River designations are in place. (Sales that are located in a designated wilderness and/or wild and scenic rivers must be included.) This would constitute a hypothetical condition.  Sales analysis sheets are required for each of the sales used in the analysis. A highest and best use analysis would be required to establish the general land types or classes for the properties within each of the six (6) mapped areas. A range of values for each of the land classes established by the appraiser must be stated in the report.  A discussion of the range of values as it applies to the specified land classes must be included in the report.  An example of land classifications that may be found in each of the six (6) map zones are as follows: (the survey does not include irrigated cropland) FEDERAL LANDS 1.  Dry grazing PRIVATE LANDS 1.  Dry Grazing 2.  Recreation If any other stratification scheme is proposed for use in the report, it must have the prior written approval of the ASD COTR. B.  Comparable Sales:  The market data survey will stratify both the offered and selected lands by land types and uses; and develop a range of values for each based on the best market data available.  Sales will be selected based on proximity, sale date, and similarity in value-affecting characteristics. The report will identify individual sales; include sales analysis sheets as outlined in attachment 1 of this SOW.  Each sale must be described in narrative form in sufficient detail to indicate how it compares with the appraised property in elements affecting value.  Buyer and seller motivations and highest and best use of the sale must be discussed.  A sufficient number of sales must be considered and analyzed to insure credible results can be reported.  The market data analyzed may have to come from other market areas but must be relevant to the properties. In selecting the comparable sales to be used in valuing a given property type, it is fundamental that all sales have the same economic highest and best use as the properties being valued. In selecting comparable sales for use in the appraisal, the appraiser should also select those sales having the same or similar zoning as the properties being valued. A comparable sales map or a series of maps, showing the relative location of the comparable sales to the property being analyzed will be included, either within the appropriate report section or in the addenda of the report. It is important that the locations of the comparable sales and the property are shown in an adequate level of detail so that a reader of the report, not familiar with the area, can understand the relative proximity of the properties.  C.  Land Owner Interviews:  The appraiser shall interview a representative sample of landowners and as to value-affecting characteristics of property and inquire as to any known sales the owner believes would be relevant to valuing their property. D.  Inspections:  The appraisal is required to make low-level (500 to 1000 feet) aerial inspections of at least 80 percent of the properties which will be evidenced in the work file by photographs, and notes. The COTR will make arrangements for someone familiar with the area to accompany the appraiser on these inspection flights if requested. Some representative on-the-ground inspections are encouraged as well as time and weather conditions permit. E.  Confidentiality:  The property and ownership information given in this statement of work pertaining to the Owyhee Initiative proposal is to be kept confidential. The market study report and all information furnished to the Appraiser are DOI internal documents and are to be considered confidential by the Appraiser. The general public is not an intended user of the market study report; however the Appraiser must also be aware that the Freedom of Information Act and Agency policy may result in the release of all or part of the market study report to others. If sales analysis includes information considered confidential, the confidential information can be omitted from the report by disclosing the confidential nature of the sale.  ASD may require verification of the information verbally or in writing so an understanding of the sale analysis is possible by the reviewer.  In no circumstance must such a confidential sale be the exclusive sale for a value conclusion of a specific land type. The Appraisal Services Directorate - ASD will not normally accept custody of confidential information.  Should the Appraiser find it necessary to rely on confidential information, he or she will contact the COR for instructions.  The COR will arrange for the reviewer to view the information and provide further instruction to the Appraiser regarding handling and storage of the confidential information. GENERAL ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS & INSTRUCTIONS: 1.  The contracted Appraiser must hold a valid State Certificate as a Certified General Appraiser for the jurisdiction in which the property is located.  (Valid credentials include those obtained directly from the jurisdiction, those issued under a reciprocity agreement, and/or those characterized as "temporary" under the jurisdiction's licensing and certification statutes.)  The appraiser must have experience in dry grazing, riparian, and recreational valuation in high mountain deserts, with and with-out the influence of wilderness designations and wild and scenic rivers designations. 2.  The Appraiser's Scope-of-Work must result in credible assignment results for the intended use.   3.  The ASD Statement-of-Work and employment contract (purchase or task order) must be included within the Addenda to the appraisal report. 4.  The appraiser may be required to attend a pre-work meeting with the property owner, the Bureau of Land Management and ASD. The date, time and place of the meeting (if required) will be coordinated by the COR and communicated to the appraiser and other necessary parties.  5.  This report does not require that each sale is individually confirmed by the appraiser; however, the sales analysis sheets must show that the information was attained by reasonable and reliable sources. 6.  The appraiser's conclusion of highest and best use must be an economic use.  A non-economic highest and best use, such as conservation, natural lands, preservation or any use that requires the property to be withheld from economic production in perpetuity, is not a valid use upon which to estimate market value. 7.  The report will be reviewed for compliance with the terms of this Statement-of-Work and USPAP Standards 4 and 5.  Findings of inadequacy, if any, will require clarification and/or correction to the report. 8.  No regression analysis may be employed in the analyses without prior discussion with, and written concurrence of, the Review Appraiser. 9.  If sales to government entities, including sales to non-profit entities with the intention of transferring the sale property to a governmental entity, are included in the report, they must be prominently identified and confirmed with at least one party to the transaction.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

GENERAL DESCRIPTION: Polyester film sleeve, sealed on one long side and one short side, according to the specifications listed below; film thickness is 3 mil; for dimensions to be specified in procurement document.  SPECIFICATIONS: 1. Composition:  Must be a clear, colorless, biaxially oriented/stressed/drawn polyethylene terephthalate film such as DuPont Teijin Melinex 516 or equivalent; and must not contain any plasticizers, surface coatings, or UV inhibitors.  The material must be guaranteed to be non-yellowing at ambient temperatures with natural aging, and dimensionally stable.  NARA reserves the right to test the material to ensure that these criteria are met.  2. Seals: Each sleeve is to be sealed on one long side and one short side using edge welding [heat].  NO ADHESIVES MAY BE USED. All seals should be complete, clear, and continuous; each item must be free of planar distortion [i.e. must rest flat on a flat surface].  Sealed edges should withstand moderate handling, as evaluated by the following three methods: by pulling the seal between two fingernails at a 45 degree angle; by running a finger along the inside of the seal; and by pulling slightly at the beginning of the cut end of a sealed edge.  If the seal cracks or splits on any of these manipulations, it is unacceptable.  3. Thickness/Dimensions: Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the polyester film thickness will be 3 mil.  Dimensions [height and width] will be specified in the procurement document; their tolerance must not exceed +/- 0.0625 inch.  4. Other Properties: Edges must be straight and meet exactly; corners must be 90 degrees; each item must be free of dents, dings, scratches, abrasions, and inclusions.  Packaging requirements to ensure the secure and undamaged delivery of particular sleeve sizes will be specified in the procurement document.  a. Packaging: The sleeves must be packed in a standard commercial container and sealed with tape.  The number of sleeves must be packaged no more than 600 per container for legal size and no more than 1,000 per container for letter size. Pallets cannot exceed six feet in height when measured from the floor to the top horizontal edge of the highest box on the pallet.  Pallets must be 48 by 48 inches in size.  b. Marking: The outside of each packing container must be legibly marked with the following information: the delivery order number, type, size, and number of sleeves packed in the container.  In order to be considered for an award, prices must be submitted for each item.  Also, vendors must quote prices for the initial 12 month period as well as the option periods in order to be considered for an award.  Failure to fully comply with the stated requirement may be cause for rejection of the quotation.  The Government will evaluate alternate pricing based on a 5% or 50% guaranteed minimum quantity to the vendor(s).  Therefore, vendors must complete both TABLE A and TABLE B to be considered for award.  The Government guarantees that 5% or 50% (at the Government's option at time of award) of the Contract Maximum Quantities will be ordered during the base period and during each year the option is exercised.  For evaluation of pricing, only pricing from the same scheme will be compared.  The Government will choose only one of these schemes and any award(s) will be made from the same pricing scheme.  The vendor must provide film sleeves in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW)/Specifications.  Individual orders placed against this contract will indicate the respective item quantities and the shipping address for delivery.  The unit prices are fixed price.  The vendor must not add shipping costs to unit prices.  CLIN's 0004, 0008, 0012, 0016, and 0020 provide for separate shipping charges.  In the event of multiple awards, the anticipated shipping costs will be allocated equitably amongst the multiple awards.  The vendor must provide a copy of the shipping charges for each order prior to shipment to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the vendor.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the Hispanic community.  Indeed, NARA?s Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.  Currently, Hispanics comprise only 1.5 percent of NARA?s workforce, as compared to 7.8 percent of the Federal workforce and 13.3 percent of the total civilian labor force.  Traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed Federal agencies to look to alternative sources for Hispanic applicants.  One source that is specifically recommended by OPM is the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).  HACU is the only national education association that represents collectively those U.S. colleges and universities designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  As such, HACU can provide NARA with a unique level of access to highly qualified Hispanic students, thereby increasing NARA?s visibility within the Hispanic community.

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF).  The IBIF purpose, as stated in Congressional Report 110-434 (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&docid=f:hr434.110.pdf), page 346 is ?to ensure that investments are made to address shortfalls in manufacturing processes and technologies in support of the Department?s long-term and short-term needs.?
Fielding and sustaining superior weapons technology is a cornerstone of United States military strategy. The DOD?s ability to obtain superior, affordable weapons in a timely manner relies on a strong domestic industrial base and access to reliable foreign manufacturing sources. The IBIF is a program directed toward strengthening domestic manufacturing capability and eliminating dependence on unreliable foreign sources. The Defense Logistics Agency is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense in executing the IBIF. Accordingly, proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that support DOD weapon systems programs in the Systems Acquisition and Systems sustainment phases (post Milestone B) of their lifecycle. (See DODI 5000.2 https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document&doc=2.)

The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing technologies supporting the Aviation, Maritime, and Land Supply Chains. The goal of the IBIF program is to develop and implement significant manufacturing technology improvements into these supply chains. Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $12 million during Fiscal Year 2008 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA. The expected cost range for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $2,000,000 with a period of performance of up to 24 months.  The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current or future weapon systems. For selectable projects, DLA may consider using existing contracts, if appropriate.   Proposers may recommend such a contracting arrangement but should confirm with the contracting Officer of the existing contract that all existing contract scope, terms, conditions and ceiling requirements are met before proposing such an arrangement.  The government is anticipating the award of cost-plus-fixed, cost sharing or cost contracts.

2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0003-08 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 21 April 2008 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. DOD MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (MANTECH) PROGRAM INFORMATION

The vision for the MANTECH Program is to enable a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters' needs throughout the defense system life-cycle. The MANTECH Program focuses on the needs of weapon system programs for affordable, low-risk development and production. It provides the crucial link between technology invention and development, and industrial applications. The MANTECH Program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and DoD facilities, e.g., depots and shipyards. The Program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production and sustainment. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs for: the ability to support 6-sigma (low variability) manufacture, and; maturation of process capabilities to acceptable, quantified risk levels; unique production capability; low-cost, high-quality manufacture; efficient factory operations and supplier interaction; decoupling of unit cost from production volume; efficient maintenance/repair processes; and rapid, low-cost spares acquisition. Projects undertaken are beyond the normal risk or interest of industry to pursue in a timely manner. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors and throughout the weapon system life-cycle. The primary benefit to the industrial base comes from the emphasis on transfer of the enhanced technologies from the initial demonstration application to the rest of industry. Investments that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not candidates for MANTECH funding.

The IBIF program is focusing on the Production and Sustainment phases of the Development life cycle. In the production phase, the emphasis is on rapid, low-cost, high-quality manufacturing; efficient factory operations and supplier interactions; and the decoupling of unit cost from production volume. In the support and sustainment phase, the concentration is on efficient repair processes; rapid, low-cost spares and replacement parts acquisition; and efficient maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations. For a complete description of the MANTECH Program see https://www.dodmantech.com.

4. TECHNICAL  AREAS OF INTEREST

The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land and Maritime and the MANTECH technology disciplines: Metals, Composites and Electronics.  (At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies, however, each offeror should clearly have a identified ?primary target? for implementing the proposed technology.  Proposals without a clearly identified target will not be considered for award.)  All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; part count reduction; innovative applications of Lean/6-Sigma; establishing a reliable domestic capability to alleviate dependence on an unreliable foreign source; and implementing dual use (equally capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; etc. Although DLA sees merit in these areas, offerors are free to innovate and are not limited to proposing only these areas. Equal consideration will be given to all approaches that enable improved weapon systems manufacturing, significant reduction of lead-times, repair cycle times, reduction of inventory levels, improved quality and lower costs.
 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

To be eligible for award of a contract, all prospective offerors must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, adequacy of accounting systems under a cost type contract, ability to comply with performance schedules, and a prior record of past performance, integrity, organization structure, experience, operational controls, technical skills, facilities and equipment.

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks interested parties to propose innovative manufacturing technology and industrial base projects under the Industrial Base Innovation Fund Program (IBIF).  The IBIF purpose, as stated in Congressional Report 110-434 (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&docid=f:hr434.110.pdf), page 346 is ?to ensure that investments are made to address shortfalls in manufacturing processes and technologies in support of the Department?s long-term and short-term needs.?
Fielding and sustaining superior weapons technology is a cornerstone of United States military strategy. The DOD?s ability to obtain superior, affordable weapons in a timely manner relies on a strong domestic industrial base and access to reliable foreign manufacturing sources. The IBIF is a program directed toward strengthening domestic manufacturing capability and eliminating dependence on unreliable foreign sources. The Defense Logistics Agency is acting on behalf of the Department of Defense in executing the IBIF. Accordingly, proposers are encouraged to submit proposals that support DOD weapon systems programs in the Systems Acquisition and Systems sustainment phases (post Milestone B) of their lifecycle. (See DODI 5000.2 https://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document&doc=2.)

The scope of the IBIF program includes all of the manufacturing technologies supporting the Aviation, Maritime, and Land Supply Chains. The goal of the IBIF program is to develop and implement significant manufacturing technology improvements into these supply chains. Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $12 million during Fiscal Year 2008 is planned to fund IBIF projects under this BAA. The expected cost range for proposals submitted under this BAA is up to $2,000,000 with a period of performance of up to 24 months.  The desirable outcome of a completed project is an advanced manufacturing capability that is implemented in the industrial base and supporting one or more current or future weapon systems. For selectable projects, DLA may consider using existing contracts, if appropriate.   Proposers may recommend such a contracting arrangement but should confirm with the contracting Officer of the existing contract that all existing contract scope, terms, conditions and ceiling requirements are met before proposing such an arrangement.  The government is anticipating the award of cost-plus-fixed, cost sharing or cost contracts.

2. GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0003-08 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 21 April 2008 to the Point of Contact listed above in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  

3. DOD MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (MANTECH) PROGRAM INFORMATION

The vision for the MANTECH Program is to enable a responsive, world-class manufacturing capability to affordably meet the warfighters' needs throughout the defense system life-cycle. The MANTECH Program focuses on the needs of weapon system programs for affordable, low-risk development and production. It provides the crucial link between technology invention and development, and industrial applications. The MANTECH Program matures and validates emerging manufacturing technologies to support low-risk implementation in industry and DoD facilities, e.g., depots and shipyards. The Program addresses production issues from system development through transition to production and sustainment. Investments are driven by defense-essential needs for: the ability to support 6-sigma (low variability) manufacture, and; maturation of process capabilities to acceptable, quantified risk levels; unique production capability; low-cost, high-quality manufacture; efficient factory operations and supplier interaction; decoupling of unit cost from production volume; efficient maintenance/repair processes; and rapid, low-cost spares acquisition. Projects undertaken are beyond the normal risk or interest of industry to pursue in a timely manner. The Program focuses on manufacturing-related needs that exist across industry sectors and throughout the weapon system life-cycle. The primary benefit to the industrial base comes from the emphasis on transfer of the enhanced technologies from the initial demonstration application to the rest of industry. Investments that would benefit a single weapon system are the responsibility of system program managers and are not candidates for MANTECH funding.

The IBIF program is focusing on the Production and Sustainment phases of the Development life cycle. In the production phase, the emphasis is on rapid, low-cost, high-quality manufacturing; efficient factory operations and supplier interactions; and the decoupling of unit cost from production volume. In the support and sustainment phase, the concentration is on efficient repair processes; rapid, low-cost spares and replacement parts acquisition; and efficient maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations. For a complete description of the MANTECH Program see https://www.dodmantech.com.

4. TECHNICAL  AREAS OF INTEREST

The areas of interest align with the DOD supply chains: Aviation, Land and Maritime and the MANTECH technology disciplines: Metals, Composites and Electronics.  (At lower tiers of the industrial base, it is understood that manufacturing technologies may cut across these Supply Chains or technologies, however, each offeror should clearly have a identified ?primary target? for implementing the proposed technology.  Proposals without a clearly identified target will not be considered for award.)  All manufacturing processes and systems are eligible for consideration, including but not limited to, new/alternative materials; faster, higher quality unit processes; reduction in process variation through advanced process control systems; tighter coupling of the supply chain through advanced information technology; part count reduction; innovative applications of Lean/6-Sigma; establishing a reliable domestic capability to alleviate dependence on an unreliable foreign source; and implementing dual use (equally capable for civil and military applications) manufacturing capability to be available to DOD during time when a surge in production is needed; etc. Although DLA sees merit in these areas, offerors are free to innovate and are not limited to proposing only these areas. Equal consideration will be given to all approaches that enable improved weapon systems manufacturing, significant reduction of lead-times, repair cycle times, reduction of inventory levels, improved quality and lower costs.
 

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to:
-	Extend the response date to March 14, 2008 @3:00 pm EST
-	Change the source selection from best value to lowest price technically acceptable with the following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance:
	   Factor 1 ? Past Performance
	   Factor 2 ? Price

All reference to the technical capability evaluation factor is removed.  Remove "The evaluation factors above are listed in descending order of importance.  Technical capability and past performances when combined are more important than price.  As offerors become more equal in technical capability and past performance, price becomes increasingly more important."  Replace with lowest price technically acceptable that meets or exceeds acceptable past performance.
