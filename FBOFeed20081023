<DESC><p>The NATO Joint Warfare Center (JWC) in Stavanger, Norway intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of contractor support to achieve Allied Command Operations and Allied Command Transformation's goal of producing Computer Assisted Exercise (CAX) databases to support Loyal Jewel 09 (LJ 09) and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Training Events (TEs) in 2009.</p>
<p>The JWC is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. This is an indefinite&nbsp;quantity&nbsp;contract. The JWC intends to use the sealed bidding, two envelope bid procedure. Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>Eligible companies are those that have been approved for participation in NATO ICB and that have performed similar contracts within the last three years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation, possess at least a valid NATO SECRET level clearance, and have appropriate training and experience in related field(s). The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>The potential accumulated value of this project is estimated to be NOK 7,500,000 ($1,060,000) The reference for this project is IFIB-ACT-JWC-09-01. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>The IFIB package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>JWC will directly e-mail this IFIB to all firms on the bidders list and will post the tender documents on the following website: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.jwc.nato.int</span></p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the contracting agency for NATO ICB projects.

PSYCHROMETER WITH CASE, SLING, POCKET TYPE:  Shall have the following characteristics:

This description covers a psychrometer to be used for determining relative humidity of atmospheric air by means of wet- and dry-bulb temperature readings.

Materials.  Corrosion-resistant metal shall be used wherever possible. Any metal causing galvanic action shall be avoided. The thermometer stem shall be standard glass.

Design and construction.  The sling psychrometer shall be furnished complete with two identical non-mercury thermometers (mounted parallel) on a metal base, one installed wick, chain, handle, and a calculator. See figures 1 and 2. The components shall be inserted into a plastic pocket case with a plastic or metal insert; the instructions may be inserted into or secured around the case.

Thermometer.  Shall consist of a stem, expansion space, bulb, non-mercury indicator and a button top. The top of the stem shall be covered by a plastic or rubber sleeve or covering so that the clip (item #5 on figure 2) does not have direct contact with the glass.

Thermometer range and graduation.  The temperature range shall include 30 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, graduated in 1 degree increments. The scale graduations shall be etched or permanent stain imprinted in the glass in whole degrees. The graduation lines shall be clear cut, straight and perpendicular to the axis of the stem. The minor graduation lines shall lie to the left of the axis and shall terminate in line with the axis. The 5 and 10 degree lines shall extend across the axis to the right. The graduations shall be numbered at each multiple of 10 degrees.

Handle and sling.  Shall be provided with a 3-3/4 inch long by 5/16 inch in diameter, partly knurled corrosion-resistant metal handle that shall be attached to a 4 inch section of corrosion-resistant metal chain. This shall be attached to the thermometer frame.

Length.  The total length of the bulb and stem shall be 5 1/8 inch. Minimum length of graduated portion shall be 2-1/4 inches.

Pigment.  All etched graduations and numerals shall be filled with black pigment.

Stain.  Permanent stain imprinting on the glass stem is permissible. Imprinted data shall be sharp and clear.

Wick.  The wick shall be chemically clean muslin or bleached cotton sewn or woven into a tubular shape. The wick shall be of sufficient length to completely cover the exposed thermometer bulb with enough additional length to allow the wick to be secured. The wick shall be tied above and below the bulb with thread, tight enough that it cannot be removed.

Pocket case.  Each psychrometer shall be furnished with a plastic pocket case, fitted with a protective metal or plastic insert, and designed to protect the complete instrument, including the handle and chain.

Calculator.  Shall be provided with a plastic calculator for determining the relative humidity.

Workmanship.  Each psychrometer shall be free from defects that impair their durability, appearance or serviceability.

Test procedures.

Thermometer accuracy.  A standard test thermometer of which the calibration is known to be within 0.1 &#61616;F over the operating range of thermometers to be tested shall be used as references for the accuracy testing. The reference thermometer shall be placed centrally among the thermometers being tested and immersed to top of liquid column in a liquid bath being constantly agitated. Both the reference and test thermometers shall have their bulbs placed at approximately the same level in the bath. The temperature of the liquid bath shall be held constant to 0.1 &#61616;F of the test point selected. Data shall not be recorded until the temperature stabilizes.

The thermometers to be tested shall be compared with the reference thermometer in an ice bath and at a series of points taken over the entire range. Test points shall be selected such that the uppermost and lowermost points fall within 0.5 &#61616;F of the end points of the specified ranges and the interval between consecutive test points shall not be closer than 10 scale divisions and no further apart than 50 scale divisions. An ice point should always be included as one of the test points, where the range of the thermometer covers an ice point. The thermometer shall indicate true temperature with the tolerance of 0.5 &#61616;F. The change in error for an interval of 20 &#61616;F shall be no greater than 0.5 &#61616;F on any part of the scale. The change in ice point during a 90 day period shall be not more than 0.1 &#61616;F. Each pair of thermometers furnished with a psychrometer shall be in agreement within 0.5 &#61616;F throughout their range. The maximum allowable error shall be 1.0 &#61616;F.

Expansion space.  The thermometer shall be immersed completely for five minutes in a water bath having a temperature of 130 0.5 &#61616;F.  The thermometer shall then be cooled in air to ambient temperature. After this test, the thermometer shall indicate true temperature within 0.5 &#61616;F.

Handle/sling test.  A one pound weight shall be attached to the sling in place of the psychrometer. The weight shall be rotated about the handle at a rate of approximately 3 revolutions per second for ten seconds. At completion of the test, there shall be no damage to the handle or sling.

<DESC>MARKET ANALYSIS SURVEYForSTAFFED NEXTGEN  TOWER (SNT) SYSTEM ENGINEERING & CONCEPT EVALUATION
ANNOUNCEMENT
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking the commercial availability of technologies to support the Staffed NextGen Towers (SNT) and Automated NextGen tower concepts.  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. 
PURPOSE
The purpose of this market analysis is to gain a better understanding of industry, academia, and government (domestic or international) capabilities in the areas of Staffed NextGen Towers (SNT).    We are seeking interested sources that are capable of immediately assisting ATO-P to research and develop the SNT concept.  Sources should reply to the 15 Areas of Capability by 1 December 2008.
The FAA will consider the information provided from this survey in developing our acquisition strategy and also in considering the contract vehicle type and whether it should be open competition, limited competition, small business set aside, or sole source procurement.  
This is not a screening information request or request for proposal.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  

BACKGROUND & SCOPE OF WORK
The Office of Air Traffic System Concept Development in the FAA Air Traffic Organization - Operations Planning (ATO-P) is currently conducting applied research and development on Staffed Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Towers (SNT). The Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, Version 2.0 dated 13 June 2007 published by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) identifies the Staffed NextGen Tower (SNT) concept for transforming Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) processes and modernizing airport operations.  This concept supports the need for new, modernized and expanded tower services in the future. For SNT, ANSP personnel provide surface and tower services by other-than-direct visual observation and may or may not be located at the airport.  SNT enables tower services to be provided at airports that may not normally receive service under a traditional tower services paradigm, and potentially enables providing tower services to multiple airports from one location.  
The goal of this development is to enable an initial investment decision planned for 2011 on an FAA system that should increase throughput and safety; provide for cost-effective expansion of services to a larger number of airports; and reduce tower construction costs.  This is a Market Analysis for concerning the requirements and design research, analysis, definition, and systems engineering in support of SNT. These activities shall consider operational roles and responsibilities, task information requirements, system architecture, system interfaces, and human factors issues as they relate to ANSP personnel, pilots, and National Air Space (NAS) users involved in airport operations.

All removed materials not suitable to future bridge maintenance shall become the property of the contractor and shall be disposed of properly (per Washington State law).

There is no vehicle access to the bridge site and a site visit (approx 0.5 mile hike) is recommended to all interested in the project.  This solicitation will be issued under FAR Part 12 for a commercial service. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to TSI Incorporated , 500 Cardigan Road, Shoreview, MN 55106, for the acquisition of  a Cendensation Particle Counter Model 3775 . TheTSI Model 3775 Condenstation Particle Counter is needed in order to use an existing TSI, Inc. Series 3080 Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer for a new laboratory measurement of particle size distribution in near real time. The TSI CPC (Model 3775) is requested with butanol as the working fluid, as other instruments in the laboratories operate with butanol as the working fluid. Without the CPC model 3775, the Series 3080 is only capable of separating particles by electrical mobility size, but not counting. The EPA has identified TSI Incorporated the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement.  In order to ensure data compatibility the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to demonstrate contractor's ability to provide maintenance of the instrument and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability, no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit your response:  to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith  by fax (919)541-4273; or, by e-mail at:  Smith.Pamela@epa.gov.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Description:
Notice of intent to use Other Than Full and Open competition: The Government currently occupies approximately 52,862 BOMA rentable square feet (RSF) of space at 601 N. Fairfax Drive, Alexandria, VA under Lease Number GS-11B-70306, which expired on July 31, 2007. The tenant in this location is scheduled to move into federally owned space by July 31, 2012. The General Services Administration plans to execute a full service succeeding lease for a 5-year firm term for 61,708 RSF, which includes approximately 6,452 BRSF of expansion space, along with 600 BRSF of secure storage space. Because moving would require a double move in a short time frame for this tenant, the Government will relocate only if cost of relocation and duplication is included in the rental consideration and the property is in Alexandria, VA.   Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Governments intent to award this procurement using Other Than Full and Open competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the procurement should provide their written comments to Emmett Miller or Todd Valentine at 202.628.6000 by November 6, 2008.

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, 'Gunfire Detection System for Unmanned Air Vehicles'. The Armys overarching requirement is to conduct simulation studies utilizing parameters from a flight proven muzzle flash detection system to analyze, define, test, and select optimum technologies to provide combat overmatch on the asymmetric battlefield. The acquisition builds upon previously completed contracted research and development as well as independent research and development conducted by Radiance Technologies, Inc.  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to Radiance Technologies, Inc, who is deemed to be the only responsible source fully capable of meeting this requirement with the lightweight Weapon Watch System.  The maximum value of the contract will be $9 million.  The contract minimum value of $800K will be met with award of the first cost-plus-fixed-fee task order using RDT&E funding under a Congressional line entitled, Gunfire Detection System for Unmanned Air Vehicles. This requirement is for simulation support of the US Army Aviation Center (USAAVNC), Ft Rucker, AL, lightweight enhancements to the existing Weapon Watch processor system into a single processor, and test and evaluation of the Weapon Watch system.  Accordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified Radiance Technologies, Inc as the only source for a mature, successfully flight demonstrated muzzle flash detection system. This system will be utilized as the reference system in the simulation effort planned at USAAVNC, Ft Rucker, AL.<BR><BR>The Government deems that substantial duplication of cost incurred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source with the required technical maturity equivalent to that of a weapon watch exists to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe required.  <BR><BR>Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Radiance Technologies, Inc., 350 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL  35805-1961.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and Radiance Technologies, Inc, consistent with alpha contracting procedures.   The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is five (5) years.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  <BR><BR>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by this agency.  Proposals/other information submitted in response to this notice are due no later than December 9, 2008, 1:00 p.m. EST.

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a multi-year service agreement for three (3) existing NIST-owned Carl Zeiss SMT Systems to include: 1. Zeiss Ultra 60 Scanning Electron Microscope; 2. Zeiss NVision 40 Focused Ion Beam; and 3. Zeiss Supra 55 Scanning Electron Microscope.  

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two responsible, qualified respondents are classified at small business manufacturers of the service described herein, then any competitive procurement solicited by NIST will be done as a small business set-aside.

Background:
The CNST Nanofab multi-user facility requires a service program to support three advanced Electron Microscope systems. These systems are used for research into Nanotechnology and are used by paying customers of the CNST NanoFab facility. Due to the complexity of these systems and extended down times to repair such a system, it is imperative that a quality service agreement be put into place to minimize disruptions and down time due to equipment/component failures, software glitches/upgrades and access to replacements parts be instituted.  

All interested Offerors must provide information that details their ability to provide a multi-year service agreement to include a minimum of the following:
Provide 1 preventative maintenance visit per year for the following three NIST-owned systems:
Zeiss Ultra 60 Scanning Electron Microscope;
Zeiss NVision 40 Focused Ion Beam; and
Zeiss Supra 55 Scanning Electron Microscope.

Provide 1 emitter tip change per year for each system listed above.
The preventative maintenance service agreement must include labor, travel, and replacement parts, excluding consumables.  The service agreement must provide inspection, adjustment and emergency repair/maintenance (during normal business hours) to maintain the three systems in factory operating condition.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 811310, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that can provide the required service maintenance are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your service or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the services for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the service, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for maintenance of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

The FSC for this is 1990 and the NAICS Code is 332999, small business size standard is 500 employees. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.

In addition, type approval would have to be sought from the American Bureau of Shipping (the ships' classification society). The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. November 7, 2008 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

Argo Marine &amp; Industrial is the only known source of the required retrofit kit. The Military Sealift Command has already paid General Electric the research &amp; development costs for the EGRs and the cost has been spread out across all the EGR components they have build. If NOAA were to pay to have the GEMS replacements designed by another vendor just for the NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER, NOAA would bear that entire additional cost. Argo Marine has parts on-hand to fabricate several EGR assemblies; and repair service for the EGRs will be available for the next decade. EGR's are direct replacements for the obsolete General Electric Monitoring Systems (GEMS) on the NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER ship's service diesel generators (SSDG's). As the unsupported GEMS wear out, failing to replace them with EGR's would result in much higher cost to the Government as some other type of control would have to be specifically designed for this application. If the GEMS fail and a replacement EGR is not available, the vessel will be dead in the water, resulting in loss of valuable sea days. In addition, type approval would have to be sought from the American Bureau of Shipping (the ships' classification society) which is a long and costly process.

<DESC>Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division (NCD), Natick, MA on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center San Diego, intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis with Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, for the purpose of creating a repository of samples from every cancer patient that visits Penn State.  Penn State Cancer Institute/Penn State College of Medicine is the leading organization commercially available with unique expertise for the study of pharmacogenetics and with laboratory resources and facilities for molecular pharmacogenetics all under one roof.  No other sources have been found to have the internal technical and subject matter capabilities to meet the requirements of this project without the need for significant outreach and collaborations across other agencies and academic institutions.  The specimens collected will be used to determine individual responses to therapeutic drugs and environmental toxins with the aim of identifying gene variations, or polymorphisms that predict drug response or toxicity.  The emphasis will be to identify germ-line genetic profiles that predispose individuals for optimal response to chemotherapy and/or radiation-based therapies for cancer treatment or prevention.  Such tasks as the development of databases necessary for the integration of patient demographic and clinical data, the biological specimen collections, and the lab-based experimental data necessary for pharmacogenetics protocols and research initiatives; developing a strategy to accrue new patients upon first arrival to the hospital; developing detailed follow-up data on toxicity and survival will be generated on all patients and performing Targeted Genotyping of pertinent metabolic and DNA pathways will be accomplished in addition to other tasks.  Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 3 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, NCD will proceed with awarding a contract to the Penn State College of Medicine.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  Any questions regarding this requirement must be addressed in writing to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760 (fax 508-233-5286) or via e-mail at jonathan.lehmann@us.army.mil no later than 10 November 2008, 12:00 pm EST.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program  It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates, the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the bullpen, serving on intermittent/part-time contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

The Senior Management Advisor is a top-level expert in the multitude of functions that comprise operations and management for USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives programs in the U.S. and overseas.  The Senior Management Advisor provides services which require the highest level of professionalism, knowledge and expertise.  This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation.  He or she will provide services to DCHA/OTI both in various field offices located overseas and in Washington.  OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.  The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Chief of OTIs Operations and Management Division or his/her designee, and spends the majority of his or her time working side by side with OTI country program implementation teams in the Field and in Washington.  All of the field activities supported, and at least 90% of the headquarters activities supported are program-focused and program funded.

The position of Senior Management Advisor is intermittent and a very senior position that requires an experienced professional who has overseas experience in diplomacy, can efficiently and effectively function in complex, difficult and unstable environments when called upon, often on extremely short notice.  The incumbent must be extremely knowledgeable not only in administrative management functions but in the manner, historical style and procedures employed by the U.S. government in the normal conduct of its business with emergency, transitional, and development activities overseas. The ability to identify key leaders in the field, and also in Washington to establish a sound professional relationship with them is critical to the success of OTIs programs in transition countries overseas.  Excellent analytical skills and the ability to grasp and resolve problems quickly are essential.  Administrative management functions include management analysis, human resources in relation to Personal Service Contractors (U.S. and Foreign National), general services (which includes vehicle management, real and personal property management and equipment and facility maintenance), records keeping and management, operating budgets, ICASS, security, and contracting and procurement.  A thorough comprehension and proven record of performance in these functions is an absolute necessity for a Senior Management Advisor to meet the requirements of the position.

OBJECTIVE

To hire an intermittent Senior Management Advisor.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<CONTACT>Kevin Dillon, Contracting Officer, Phone 609-813-2833, Fax 609-383-1973, Email kevin.dillon@dhs.gov
<DESC>	Scope of Work

The Homeland Security Advanced Research Programs Agency (HSARPA) has committed funds to TSL to create a developmental test and evaluation facility for testing and demonstrating candidate SAFECON technologies.  This outdoor facility will have the following assets and capabilities: 
	One or more standard maritime shipping containers in good condition and fully functional
	A representative spreader-bar in good condition and fully functional
	A crane capable of lifting and moving a fully loaded maritime shipping container, an attached spreader-bar, and a candidate spreader-bar-mounted scanning device (test article) in a manner similar to that which might be typical during lading.
This statement of work requires the contractor to design, provide, install, and make operational, a crane in accordance with the following requirements.
C-2.1   Design Requirements
a.	The crane shall be an overhead or top running crane to be erected on an outdoor, leveled surface.  The crane shall consist of 
	the crane support structure holding in place two parallel overhead rails on which a crane bridge will translate, 
	the crane bridge having two parallel rails on which moves a winch trolley perpendicular to the motion of the bridge, and 
	the winch trolley with a winch system.   
	the winch system shall be fitted with a headblock having at least four attachment points for lifting loads without uncontrolled rotation.  The attachment points will form a level, 2000mm by 2000mm square.
b.	The contractor shall design and construct the crane inclusive of its support structure
c.	The crane support structure shall have a permanent safe access from the ground to the crane.  This should consist of a ladder to a platform at the crane level, to access the crane for maintenance and repair purposes. 
d.	The crane shall have an unrestricted trolley travel in a rectangular area of no less than 100 feet by 50 feet (henceforth to be referred to as the area of operation). 
e.	Contractor shall specify appropriate load bearing footings for the crane support structure.  These specifications shall be delivered at least 4 weeks prior to the anticipated start of on-site construction. 
f.	Major components of the crane purchased from third party vendors shall be installed and configured in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations.  Major components include but are not limited to the crane bridge and winch trolley. 
g.	Contractor shall provide one spreader-bar in good working condition. The spreader-bar will be a model currently in use at some major US Port.  The spreader-bar shall be capable of safely engaging both 40-foot and 20-foot shipping containers. 
h.	Contractor shall provide a truss or other structural interface for connecting the spreader-bar to the headblock attachment points.  This interface shall be able to connect the headblock to the spreader-bar in a manner that orients the spreader-bar so that it can engage containers whose long side is either parallel or perpendicular to the long side of the crane operating area.
i.	Contractor shall access power for this project at a cubicle immediately adjacent to the crane location.  Contractor shall provide power cabling with appropriate terminations.  Contractor shall field verify all dimensions and shall submit cabling and termination system to the Government for final approval.  All electrical work will be done in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC).
j.	The maximum height of the crane shall not exceed 60 feet above ground level.
k.	Paintable structure of the crane shall be painted Homeland Security Blue (Pantone 2955C, Federal Standards 595B color 15052 or DuPont Imron SpectraMaster BS904).
l.	Contractor shall provide one standard 40-foot ventilated shipping container in good condition.

<DESC><p>The Pacific Northwest Forest &amp; Range Experiment Station, Olympia, Washington, intends to acquire by contract remodeling of the Olympia Forestry Sciences Laboratory by: (1) redesign of the reception area to provide security and manage visitors better; (2) enclose the breezeway between the main building and south wing to allow easier access to be environmentally friendly; and (3) convert existing loading dock to include office, hot and cold storage, and an ADA bathroom with shower.  The building is an attractive wood-framed, beveled-siding building with a mansard roof.  The new remodel will maintain and/or complement the look and feeling of the existing structure, utilizing widely available materials.
The government will proceed to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation, restricted to HubZone small business concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on price, experience, and past performance.  Contract award will be to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government. The government estimated price is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  
The project is located at the Pacific Northwest Forest &amp; Range Experiment Station, Forestry Sciences Laboratory, 3625 &ndash; 93rd Avenue S.W., Olympia, Washington.  On I-5, south of Olympia, take exit #99 to 93rd Avenue.  Head west one mile to the Olympia Laboratory.
The performance period is 240 calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed.
Performance and payment bonds are required for this project.  Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to this solicitation and any resulting contract.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on, or about, JULY 01, 2008.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.

For additional information contact Mr. Miley Sutherland, Contracting Officer at 360-956-2471.  Mr. Robert Avila, (360) 891-5271, is the Project Engineer.</p>

<DESC><p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Argo Marine &amp; Industrial, 1209 Baker Road, Suite 511, Virginia Beach, Virginia for the following requirement: Four (4) each Retrofit Kit for General Electric Electronic Governor Remote (EGR), GE P/N DS6820EGRB for the NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER. The delivery date is February 10, 2009. Deliverables to be delivered to: NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER, 151 Watts Ave., Pascagoula, Mississippi 39567. <strong>In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.</strong> Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1). The FSC for this is 1990 and the NAICS Code is 332999, small business size standard is 500 employees. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Argo Marine &amp; Industrial is the only known source of the required retrofit kit. Argo Marine has parts on-hand to fabricate several EGR assemblies; and repair service for the EGRs will be available for the next decade. EGR's are direct replacements for the obsolete General Electric Monitoring Systems (GEMS) on the NOAA Ship GORDON GUNTER ship's service diesel generators (SSDG's). As the unsupported GEMS wear out, failing to replace them with EGR's would result in much higher cost to the Government as some other type of control would have to be specifically designed for this application. In addition, type approval would have to be sought from the American Bureau of Shipping (the ships' classification society).&nbsp; This is a long process and if a unit fails, and there is no replacement, the ship could possible have to be tied up and could not perform her mission, resulting in lost sailing time and lost data.&nbsp;The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. November 7, 2008 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required Retrofit Kits. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.</p>

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Broad Agency Announcement for Close Air Support of Ground Troops in Contact

<RESPDATE>110108
<CONTACT>Roxanne A. Gerry, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-5177, Fax 813-826-7504, Email gerryr@socom.mil
<DESC>Program Objectives and Description:The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) announces interest in research and development of persistent airborne Close Air Support (CAS) of ground Troops in Contact (TIC).  The area of interest includes new ideas and innovative approaches to rapidly mature proven technologies to a production readiness state, as well as applications of existing COTS-NDI solutions that may be integrated onto an existing airframe.  Operational considerations include austere fields, small support crew, minimal aircrew, low weight and drag.  Primary interest is in the following areas, listed in descending order of priority:
Fire Control Systems (Integrated-Stand Alone)
Battle-Mission Management
Integrated Air-Ground Picture (IAGP):
Cooperative Engagement Capability    
- Sensor Correlation-Evaluation
- Simulation and Modeling
- Command, Control, and Communications
- Network Centric Operations
- System Interoperability
- Other Applicable IAP Technologies
- Data, Sensor, Display Fusion  
Day-Night and Active-Passive Sensors
Target Identification-Recognition 
Weapons-Warhead Accuracy-Lethality
Precision Guided Munitions, Launchers
Guns, Mounts
Human or Machine Interface 
Communications (Local, Global)
Other applicable technologies

Teaming is encouraged.  An offeror may submit more than one concept aligned with the technologies listed above.  Responses are requested from any responsible US organizations including those from private industry, academic institutions, research institutions and non-profit organizations.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  

Responses:  Interested parties are invited to submit a white paper for preliminary consideration.  White papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA up to the expiration date of the BAA.  Successful responses should segment their studies into an initial 8 month or shorter Phase 1 to explore and validate the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more additional phases as optional efforts culminating in technology demonstration.  The total effort including options should not exceed 24 months.  Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.

Format: The form and format for white papers follows below.  White papers that do not satisfy these form and format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation.  All submissions should be in the English language.  White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word.  

White Paper Preparation: A white paper should be a brief summary.  It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with government, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection or award within this BAA.  White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development and demonstration being proposed.  White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked White Paper), a ten page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole.  All pages should be printable on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts.  No formal transmittal letter is required.  White papers shall not include classified information. 

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION WITH PROPRIETARY DATA: When an offeror must include proprietary data in order to fully communicate their concept, the offeror must clearly mark and identify any proprietary data that the offeror intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes.  The offeror must also identify any technical data contained in the white paper that it is furnishing to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure.  In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper.  Records or data bearing one of the DFARS-approved restrictive legends may be included in the white paper.  It is the intent of the Government to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.

The offerors are cautioned, however, that portions of the white papers may be subject to release under terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.

NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor, which is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by USSOCOM from non-Government consultants and experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as GOVERNMENT ONLY. Evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators.


Submittal address: All white papers should be sent electronically to:  Maj Brady Hauboldt, USSOCOM, SOAL-FW, (813) 826-9390, brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.  White papers received by USSOCOM but not submitted specifically to the BAA may not be considered under the BAA.

Evaluation and Notification: Acknowledgment of receipt of all white papers will be made. White papers will not be returned.  White papers will be evaluated based on the relevance to the SOF mission.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in any subsequent proposal preparation and review.  Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  

Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the technology objectives rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of white papers received under this BAA.  Listed in descending order of importance: 1) potential contribution to CAS-TIC mission; 2) likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful; 3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort; 4) overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and demonstration approach; 5) project plan; and 6) cost and cost realism.  All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.  

The BAA will remain open for submissions until 1 Nov 2008 1200 am (EST).  Submissions received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  USSOCOM will review and respond to each white paper on a quarterly basis; however reserves to right to review and respond as submissions are submitted.  Upon completion of the evaluation, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has merit and will be considered for award as funds become available, or 2) the proposal does not contain sufficient relevance to the SOF mission to be of interest to the command.  

Awards: Funds are currently available for multiple awards.  An invitation to submit a full proposal will be made to offerors on the basis of the white paper evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government.  Awards will be subject to the availability of funds.  Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  All work beyond Phase I shall be submitted as options.  An estimated cost for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument.  All awards made as a result of this BAA will require the awardee to deliver a final technical report (as a minimum) at the end of the contract and or options.  The government will have unlimited data rights to all information and  products generated under contracts that result from this BAA.

Classified Submissions: White paper and proposal submissions in response to this BAA should be kept UNCLASSIFIED.  If classified information is expected to result from any contract, the offeror shall notify USSOCOM in the white paper or proposal.
  
Organizational Conflict of Interest:  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any government technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation.

Administration: USSOCOM will reply to questions relating to this BAA and will make replies to questions of general interest available to prospective offerors.  All correspondence including questions and requests for access to the replies to the questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to one of the addresses below.  USSOCOM prefers to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding this BAA.  The address for this BAA are: EMail:  brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.  Mail: U.S. Special Operations Command, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621. Point of Contact:  Maj Brady Hauboldt, (813) 826-9390.
