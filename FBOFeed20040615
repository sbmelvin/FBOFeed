<DESC>The posting amends an earlier synopsis entitled “Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Support Services” which was posted on April 20, 2004, as a potential sole source action to the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation, Akron, OH.   Information contained in the amendment is being provided to better describe the specific tasks associated with this project in an effort to assist alternative sources in determining whether they possess the qualifications to perform the work.  

BACKGROUND:  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an incurable brain disorder that occurs with an incidence of 1 case per million annually. The majority of patients die within 6 months of illness onset. The disease causes damage to the brain leaving patients completely dependent on their caregivers for the most basic needs of daily living. The services provided through this project will greatly assist in achieving CDC’s goal of increasing the number of autopsies of suspected CJD cases, increasing public awareness about CJD, and providing support to CJD families. To date, the CJD Foundation has implemented several initiatives to provide support to CJD patients and their families. Maintaining a toll-free helpline to provide support to these family members from others who have gone through the same experience is extremely helpful. Creating a forum in which family members can receive assistance and discuss issues related to home and post-mortem care is crucial. The CJD Foundation Family Conference creates an additional forum that facilitates dialogue between researchers working on CJD and the family members. These discussions help researchers to gain more knowledge about the social impacts of the disease and exchange ideas on potential areas of research. Learning more about prion diseases through autopsy study of CJD cases would assist in the surveillance of potentially emerging forms of the disease and would facilitate the development of a pre-mortem diagnostic test or treatment for CJD. The CJD Foundation could play a key role in helping to increase the number of autopsies of CJD cases by educating family members and health care providers about the need for autopsy. This can be achieved through the production and distribution of informational booklets on “Guide for autopsy of suspected CJD cases.” 
 
PURPOSE:  This acquisition is to continue maintenance of a toll-free helpline that provides guidance and information to families of CJD patients and creating a forum in which families can exchange information. The service provided by the CJD Foundation should encourage family members of CJD patients to discuss the need for autopsy with the attending physician and increase family member’s awareness about the critical need for autopsy. Continued sponsorship of the CJD Foundation Family Conference will raise public awareness about CJD and provide prion disease researchers with an opportunity to share their work

SPECIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:  

A)  Maintain a toll-free helpline to provide:   1)  Information to family members of CJD patients about the disease to help them prepare for the eventual fatal outcome of the disease;   2)  A forum in which family members of CJD patients can network to share information with each other;  and  3)   guidance on various types of services (e.g., hospice, funeral home) that would be helpful to family members of CJD patients.

B)  Educate family members of CJD patients, produce a booklet on “Guide for autopsy of suspected CJD cases,” highlighting current barriers to autopsies and indicating why autopsies are needed and the need for family members to provide consent for autopsies. Such an information booklet could also highlight the fact that surveillance for emerging forms of CJD and progress in CJD research, particularly the development of a pre-mortem CJD test or treatment, heavily rely on learning more about the disease through autopsy studies of CJD cases.

C)  Educate health care workers and the public about CJD via a website,  teleconferences, meetings, and development of educational materials to:   1)  Increase awareness about the disease;  2)  Describe the need to conduct autopsy of suspected CJD cases to facilitate surveillance of the disease;  and  3)  Increase awareness about the state-of-the art free CJD diagnostic services provided by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center.

D)  Sponsor a national conference that would bring together family members and   professionals working on prion diseases.
 
Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.   
To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess at least 2 years of experience in delivering the kind of activities outlined in the SOW including:  facilitate interaction and provide support services to family members of CJD patients, educate family members to increase the low autopsy rate among CJD patients (an impediment to CDC's CJD surveillance activities), and bring together family members of CJD patients and CJD researchers to facilitate interactions on significant issues affecting family members that would advance applied CJD research and national surveillance programs.  Responses must contain no more than 10 pages total.    

Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this amended announcement.  Submit written information to:   Kimberly Groves, MS-1019, Reference:  0000HCRU-2004-08490, DHHS/PHS/CDC, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV  26505, or responses may be submitted electronically to Kimberly Groves at kpg0@cdc.gov.   

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist.  Information received will be used solely  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>This posting further amends an earlier synopsis entitled “Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Support Services” which was initially posted on April 20, 2004, and amended by a posting on May 6, 2004.  Information contained in the amendment is being provided to better define requirements for submission of capabilities from alternative sources.  

BACKGROUND:  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an incurable brain disorder that occurs with an incidence of 1 case per million annually. The majority of patients die within 6 months of illness onset. The disease causes damage to the brain leaving patients completely dependent on their caregivers for the most basic needs of daily living. The services provided through this project will greatly assist in achieving CDC’s goal of increasing the number of autopsies of suspected CJD cases, increasing public awareness about CJD, and providing support to CJD families. To date, the CJD Foundation has implemented several initiatives to provide support to CJD patients and their families. 

These initiatives include maintaining a toll-free helpline to provide support to these family members who have gone through the same experience, creating a forum in which family members can receive assistance and discuss issues relating to home and post-mortem care, and facilitate dialogue between researchers working on CJD and the family members.  These discussions help researchers to gain more knowledge about the social impacts of the disease and exchange ideas on potential areas of research.  

CDC is convinced that the more CDC can provide help to diagnosing neurologists and to the relatives of patients and the more relatives know about prion diseases, the more likely such relatives will want, or at least not object to, obtaining a brain autopsy on the CJD patient. 
 
Learning more about prion diseases through autopsy study of CJD cases would assist in the surveillance of potentially emerging forms of the disease and would facilitate the development of a pre-mortem diagnostic test or treatment for CJD.   An important objective of this acquisition is to increase the number of autopsies of CJD cases by educating family members and health care providers about the need for autopsy.  
 
PURPOSE:  This acquisition is intended to enhance surveillance of human prion disease by maintaining a toll-free helpline that provides guidance and information to families of CJD patients and creating a forum in which families can exchange information. The service provided by this acquisition should encourage family members of CJD patients to discuss the need for autopsy with the attending physician and increase family member’s awareness about the critical need for autopsy.   Autopsy information provides CDC a means to identify new and emerging dieases early.   Continued sponsorship of a national conference in which family members can discuss issues and facilitate dialogue with CJD researchers will raise public awareness about CJD and provide prion disease researchers with an opportunity to share their work and target new research activities.


SPECIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:  

A)  Maintain a toll-free helpline 24 hours/7 days a week, manned between the hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm with voice mail and remote access on evenings and weekends.  The helpline would provide:   1)  Information to family members of CJD patients about the disease to help them prepare for the eventual fatal outcome of the disease;   2)  A forum in which family members of CJD patients can network to share information with each other;  and  3)   guidance on various types of services (e.g., hospice, funeral home) that would be helpful to family members of CJD patients

B)  Educate family members of CJD patients by  producing a booklet  “Guide for autopsy of suspected CJD cases,” highlighting current barriers to autopsies and indicating why autopsies are needed and the need for family members to provide consent for autopsies. Such an information booklet could also highlight the fact that surveillance for emerging forms of CJD and progress in CJD research, particularly the development of a pre-mortem CJD test or treatment, heavily rely on learning more about the disease through autopsy studies of CJD cases.

C)  Educate health care workers and the public about CJD via a website,  teleconferences, meetings, and development of educational materials to:   1)  Increase awareness about the disease;  2)  Describe the need to conduct autopsy of suspected CJD cases to facilitate surveillance of the disease;  and  3)  Increase awareness about the state-of-the art free CJD diagnostic services provided by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center.

D)  Sponsor a national conference that would bring together family members and   professionals working on prion diseases.

Among the deliverables are 1) statistics on the number and type of phone calls handled on the toll free helpline; 2) copies of education materials developed by the awardee; and 3) summaries of the proceedings of the conference including the number of persons attending.  
 
Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.   

To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess at least two years of task-related experience in maintaining a toll-free helpline 24 hours/7 days a week, producing informational booklets, educating healthcare workers and the public via a website, teleconferences, meetings and the development of educational material, and sponsoring a national conference as described above.

<CONTACT>Tom Leonard Supervisor, Fish Operations /  5095755848256  tleonard@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Western Group, Portland Oregon. The proposed action is to purchase woven wire mesh used in the fabrication of rotary fish screening devices. The NAICS code for the needed product is 331222 with a size standard of 1,000: 3312  Steel Product Manufacturing from Purchased Steel  331222  Steel Wire Drawing This industry group comprises establishments primarily engaged inmanufacturing iron and steel tube and pipe, drawing steel wire, androlling or drawing shapes from purchased iron or steel.  The data published with NAICS code 331222 include the following SIC industry: 3315 Steel wire and related products (pt)   The specifications for purchase of wire to meet Reclamations' need is:T-104 Stainless, clear span, 0.117, 4-1/2 mesh .015 (12GA)   width is 72" and length varies from 480" to 540"                                  Background: In the Pacific Northwest, juvenile fish screen design criteria for salmonid protection has been developed by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The NMFS juvenile fish screen criteria is now applied regionally for salmonid protection, due to efforts of the Fish Screen Oversight Committee comprised of fisheries personnel from fish and wildlife agencies in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana.  Protecting  the fisheries resources from hydroelectric, irrigation, municipal water supply and industrial water supply developments, created the need for design criteria for the construction of juvenile fish screens to protect the fisheries resource from project impacts. The method most widely accepted and most successful method to accomplish juvenile salmonid passage is to provide a physical barrier that safely prevents fish from becoming entrained into a diversion and routes the juvenile fish back to the river. A physical barrier is commonly used for juvenile fish protection in the Pacific Northwest when water is diverted for agriculture, ranching, power production, municipal water supply or other uses. The most commonly used type of physical barrier juvenile fish screen used in the Pacific Northwest is the rotary drum screen. This type of screen has the advantage of providing continuous cleaning action and removes most types of debris away from the screen face. Rotary drum screens have been used for diversions up to 3,000 CFS.  A rotary drum screen operates by using a power system (electric motor, paddlewheel, solar drive or hydraulic motor) to rotate the drum. The steel framed drum is wrapped in wire mesh and set within a steel cradle, this cradle when set in the concrete structure cannot have a tolerance greater than ½" from the sides of the cradle to the concrete structure. To prevent fish from escaping through this opening it is required by NMFS that rubber seals be applied to both sides and at the bottom of the drum where a gap may occur to due a non level concrete floor or silt build up. It is imperative that when the mesh is attached to the drum that it lay flat so that during the rotation process there are no gaps between the mesh and the rubber side seal that would prohibit a continuous contact of mesh and seal. Physical contact with a screen material causes some level of fish injury and/or mortality. Woven wire mesh is widely used as a screen face material. As the name implies, it is constructed by a woven mesh of wire.  In addition to hydraulic aspects of screen design, the screen face material itself must be smooth, without projections or gaps that could cause de-scaling or other injury. It is important to consider that some screen materials have a rough side and a smooth side, and the smooth side will be used on the upstream side in case fish do contact the screen surface. These details are addressed by specification in this documentation to assure quality construction through a thorough inspection process.  Requirements: Even though the 'intended sole source' product is considered 'commercial' in nature the delivery and packaging of the product is not commercial in nature. Reclamations' strict delivery requirements are as follows: All screen mesh must be rolled to 3 feet 6 inches inside diameter or larger. Screen mesh shall not be rolled in a roller at any time. Screen mesh must lay flat when unrolled and each roll will be unrolled and inspected upon delivery. Screen with wave, bubbles, misfires, other defects, or any deviation from roll specifications will be rejected upon delivery and any delay or reshipment cost will be borne by the vendor. Past procurement has shown that The Western Group is the only ready available vendor that can meet the shipping requirements. The acquisition of screen material from other vendors over the past 5 years has resulted in rejected product; thus causing substantial cost to the Government in production deadline, NMFS time frames (which are critical with endangered or threatened species rearing, habitat and migration) and the Administrative cost of the procurement.  The government believes that only one responsible source can readily provide the product listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements, to include positive past performance in the weaving, packaging and delivery of woven wire mesh.  All responses received by close of business June 21, 2004 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), has a continuing requirement for System Development and Integration (SDI) services.  This is a re-competition of the current System Development and Maintenance contracts held by Lockheed Martin (Contract No.50-PBPT-7-00003) and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) (Contract No. 50-PBPT-7-00004).  The current contracts expire May 2005.  The USPTO intends to make award by November 30, 2004, to allow sufficient time for transition. The new SDI requirement will to provide the necessary skilled staff, tools, and other resources to analyze, design, develop, enhance, deploy, maintain, and operate the USPTO application systems.  The services required to perform life cycle activities include system design and analysis, programming, testing, integration, customer training (to include technical personnel), implementation, operations, system/software maintenance, project-specific system engineering, information/software engineering, product assurance, project management, and other related services and products.  Software products and hardware are needed for system life cycle support of development, maintenance, and enhancement activities.  Some integration efforts may result in providing systems for total solutions to meet the business requirements. This work will be performed for existing automated information systems and those future systems initiated during the contract period of performance. The “USPTO Strategic Information Technology Plan for Fiscal Years 2004-2009”, provides a high-level description of the programs and systems/projects that USPTO anticipates will be supported, at a minimum, by the SDI contract(s).

This acquisition will be conducted using the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) located at:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/acquproc.htm. Under PTAG, FAR Part 15 does not apply and “full and open competition” is replaced with “maximum reasonable competition” which authorizes the USPTO to limit the number of offerors to a predetermined number.  Upon review of the responses to this Synopsis, the top highest ranked offerors will be notified and instructed on the next phase of the procurement process which will be the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  As a result of the responses to this Synopsis, those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised and will not receive further consideration.  The USPTO will evaluate vendors’ responses based on technical, management, past performance and cost features and rank the offerors in terms of qualifications and highest probability to successfully fulfill the USPTO’s requirements.  Ultimate source selections will be based upon a best value determination. 
 
The process will include submission of an initial capability statement to the USPTO, submittal of the company’s response to the scenario, Electronic Government (E-Gov), as described below, an evaluation and a down-select of vendors by the USPTO.  The USPTO is utilizing a Two-Step Streamlined Contracting Approach in accordance with PTAG.   Step 1:   Review Capability Statement and vendor response to the scenario described below and down-select to no more than 5 most highly qualified vendors.   Step 2:  Issue RFP to the vendors selected from Step 1 and award to the offeror providing the best value.  

This procurement is unrestricted, full and open competition.  The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.  The small business size is $21.0 million. 

The USPTO is soliciting Capability Statements from responsible sources which clearly establish their ability to meet or exceed the USPTO’s SDI Capabilities Requirement (CR).   The CR will be posted to the USPTO’s website located at:  http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/businopp.htm.  Interested offerors shall submit a capability statement  (maximum 20 pages, excluding cost information), and response to the E-GOV scenario (35 pages maximum, including methodology and planning assumptions) as described below.  Instructions for preparing a response to this Synopsis are as follows:

1.	All Capability Statement documents shall be submitted as outlined below: 
-  Three copies on a CD formatted in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat; 
-  Page margins shall be one (1) inch on all sides and formatted for 8 ½” by 11” single-spaced print; 
	-  The type for all proposal documents (including charts and graphs) shall be black; 
-  The characters per inch shall not exceed twelve (12) characters per linear inch or be smaller than twelve (12) point; 
	-  The font shall be Times New Roman 12 pt; and shall not exceed six (6) lines per vertical inch.

Failure to submit Capability Statements in compliance with these requirements may result in a determination that the proposal is non-compliant, which may eliminate the proposal from further consideration.

2.	The Capability Statement shall be a maximum of 20 pages.  Vendors shall describe their capability to satisfy the size, scope and characteristics of the requirements as defined in the CR, assuming a task order based contract.  The response must address three specific areas:  (1) the technical approach as related to the USPTO’s requirements set forth in the CR; (2) the management approach including organization structure and staffing, teaming arrangements, and small business participation; (3) past performance information that shall include a description of at least three previous or current contracts that demonstrate a proven ability to meet the USPTO’s requirements and describe their relevance to the USPTO’s effort in terms of similarity of size and scope.  The past performance response must include the period of performance dates, the type of contract (i.e., task order, performance based, etc.), dollar value, description of work performed, and a point of contact (including phone number).  Additionally, if the response represents a team of companies, with a prime and non-prime companies, each non-prime company must provide at least one relevant contract reference; and (4) cost.  For purposes of providing cost information in response to this Synopsis, offerors are required to provide labor rate(s) for the proposed program manager, a breakdown of the cost elements which compose the labor rate, and all applicable indirect cost rates (i.e. overhead, G&A) which would be applied to all labor categories utilized under any resulting contract. See CR for all labor categories which may be used under any resulting contract.

3.  Vendors shall provide a response to the E-GOV scenario described below which shall consist of a maximum of 35 pages (text and graphics) including methodology and planning assumptions.   Vendors shall describe the manner and methodology in which they would approach the E-GOV scenario.  The proposed methodology must be described along with any planning assumptions.  The USPTO Life Cycle Methodology may be used as appropriate.  The vendor’s response shall follow whatever methodology proposed.  

As part of the scenario response, provide a plan describing: the current or emerging standards and/or tools you would use; the types of staff and other resources needed to accomplish the plan using labor categories from the CR; and the critical technical and/or managerial issues that will affect the work.  The plan must contain a project plan containing planned activities, activity durations and dependencies, relevant past performance references as specifically related to this scenario; performance metrics used to ensure success, and methods to provide regular visibility by USPTO for analysis, design, development, and production models or other relevant elements of technical progress.  

References (links) to outside data sources will not be read or considered.

Electronic Government (E-Gov) 

Describe how to leverage an enterprise architecture (EA) to improve information technology efficiency and effectiveness compliant with an EA framework (for example, the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)) and aligned with an organization’s agency or corporate strategic plan. At a minimum address the following in your response:

Describe how to support cross-agency collaboration, transformation, and government-wide improvements.  

Specifically address how to implement electronic government that enables the  reduction/elimination of paper handling and the enhancement of business processes including electronic filing (e-filing) and end-to-end workflow processes.

Describe how to support a world-class information technology operation that meets or exceeds end-user needs; providing maximum availability of computer systems to a federal agency. Ensure that the systems address Certification and Accreditation requirements.

Paper copies of the CR will not be issued. Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and/or list of interested vendors will not be available.  An industry briefing was held in January concerning these requirements.  A list of attendees may be found at the following Internet site:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/sdisupp/sdihom.htm.  

The USPTO promotes socio-economic programs and expects maximum participation with small, minority-owned, women-owned, HUB-Zone, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses in teaming arrangements.  The USPTO’s minimum requirement for subcontracting opportunities for socio-economic goals will be 30% of the contracting dollars, awarded as a result of this procurement. 
  
The USPTO anticipates awarding one or more contract(s) as a result of this competition.  It is anticipated the contract type will be cost-plus-award fee performance-based contract with task order provisions including provisions for the issuance of fixed-price task orders.  The base period of performance will be for a term of two years, with three (1-year) option years, and the ability to earn two additional 1-year terms as incentives.  The annual level of effort for this requirement is anticipated to be 600,000 hours.  Vendors will be required to be located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area in order to respond to the Government’s requirements for meetings or system support at the USPTO offices in either Arlington or Alexandria, VA.  

All relevant documents for this procurement will be posted on at the Internet address:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm.

It is the responsibility of each prospective offeror to check the project web site regularly for amendments, questions and answers, and other pertinent information concerning the procurement.  An offeror’s failure to check the website will not be a justifiable excuse for requesting an extension to the proposal due date.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 pm (EDT), July 9, 2004, at the following address:  (for U.S. Postal Service deliveries) U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Office of Procurement, Mail Stop 6, P.O.

B. Full Text of Announcement

Force Multipliers for Urban Area Operations BAA04-31.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for a multi-phase program pursuing the performance of research, development, design, and testing that directly supports advancement of Urban Operation Technologies providing revolutionary improvements to warfighting in the urban environment.  In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the Force Multipliers for Urban Area Operations (FMUOps) Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa for further information. The Force Multipliers for Urban Area Operations PIP contains additional details regarding the Program Objectives, Program Description, Test and Evaluation, Program Scope, General Information, Submission Process, Reporting Requirements and Procedures, Proposal Format, Evaluation and Funding Processes, and Administrative Addresses.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 

PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA. The envisioned outcome of the FMUOps program is revolutionary improvements to warfighting in the urban environment (WUE). The goal is to support DARPA’s Strategic Thrust for Force Multipliers for Urban Area Operations   by providing technical and operational options that make the planning and execution of urban operations as responsive, flexible, and successful as other aspects of U.S. warfighting. Solutions may apply to operations both before and after the cessation of large-scale hostilities. Of particular interest are solutions that address the very different challenges presented by WUE and dramatically enhance war fighter capabilities; for example, the ability to sense, maneuver and operate in three dimensions. These changes should generally result in lower casualties, lower collateral damage, and higher mission effectiveness with smaller applied force.

The following areas are of specific interest:

1.	System Architecture and Integration:  DARPA is seeking novel new technologies and an integrated CONOPS specifically tailored for the urban environment to reduce casualties while increasing the speed of operations.  DARPA is interested in new “urbanized” technologies and operating concepts that would give U. S. Combat forces the ability to deny opposing forces the opportunity to hide in urban environments.  
2.	Persistent Staring Reconnaissance, Surveillance, & Target Acquisition (RSTA) systems:  This area seeks advances in intelligence gathering for city-wide targets, particularly approaches that reflect the three dimensional nature of this environment. Systems of interest include: capabilities to detect and characterize personnel and equipment in severe urban clutter and through external and internal building walls; flying / perching machines able to carry and operate communications and sensor payloads; survivable urban-canyon flying vehicles; systems that discriminate combatants from non-combatants in crowded urban settings; systems to detect contraband material and equipment; capabilities to detect snipers and rocket propelled grenade (RPG) gunners before firing;  systems that synthesize data from multiple sensors to predict threats and determine intent and other high-persistence methods of maintaining situational awareness and time-critical response in urban environments.
3.	Weapons for Urban Operations:  The objective is to develop on-demand, infantry-operated, ultra-precision, beyond-line-of-sight, lethal and non-lethal weaponry that has high maneuverability for use in the congested, three dimensional urban environments and technologies that support these goals such as; low cost laser designators, low-cost military grade encryption techniques, autonomous target recognition and classification (particularly for asymmetric threats), etc.  The desired maneuvering capability should be consistent with narrow and congested urban environments.  
4.	Urban Access with Minimal Infrastructure Disruption:  Technologies are needed to enhance urban mobility including: novel communications for individual soldiers, weapons particularly suited to the urban environment, vertical mobility for infantry; enhanced mobility for force and logistics transport through a city; and novel systems for urban movement.  Technologies that enhance the survivability for air and ground assets are needed; for example technologies that provide effective defense against such threats as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), MANPADS, RPGs and small arms. The ability to negate urban obstacles and move with a minimum signature, at a speed faster than the adversary, is desired.
5.	Asymmetric Warfare Countermeasures:  The objective is to prevent successful attacks on troops by combatants employing guerrilla tactics, suicide fighters, or remotely-activated (IEDs).  Tools to detect and destroy IEDs, prevent attack, mitigate damage, and provide effective response mechanisms are desired.  Non-lethal responses / non-lethal weapons should be considered, especially in the areas of crowd control or to engage enemy forces commingled with civilians.
6.	Pre- and Post-Conflict Capabilities:  The objectives are to provide anticipatory capabilities that model and understand social indicators that precipitate hostility and conflict (see item 10 as well) and to develop and assess mitigating and shaping options to stabilize an urban area. Analysis functions that can interpret effects of military and civil operation on the hostility of the population are desired.  In addition, force multiplier technologies are sought that augment the size, mobility and capability of limited number of forces in the region and create the perception of a larger military presence critical for security.
7.	Rapid Stabilization, Pacification and Law Enforcement Tools:  Technologies and systems are sought to provide omnipresent infrastructure protection and/or restoration; modify/limit weapons discharge as a function of aim-point signature; enhance DOD information dissemination; provide weapons stores detection; remotely identify and track individuals; and improve the technologies available to perform DOD civil affairs functions (e.g. medical, law enforcement, etc.).  Technologies supporting these goals such as efficient urban-soldier transport systems, methods for tracking, localization and identification of friendly vehicles and personnel are  also of interest.  
8.	Command, Control, and Intelligence (C2I) for Urban Warfighting:  New approaches to collaborative and all-echelon C2I, along with automated intelligence analytical tools, are needed to support urban operations. Systems that can rapidly develop high-fidelity urban terrain maps with automated functionality and which can exhibit learning and tracking of past events are of interest. The goal is to create a collaborative environment that allows warfighters to see, understand, and interact with the urban battlespace in “real time.”  The urban approach requires tactical data at the level of the individual soldier that may be fed from local or remote networked sensors as well as new approaches for developing and predicting the effect of psychological operations.  The C2I systems need to integrate unmanned capabilities with manned systems and provide support to the lowest level warfighter to include fire coordination for squad level indirect fire weapons.  
9.	Logistics & Support:  The goal is to develop technologies that significantly reduce overhead required to support and train soldiers in urban combat.  This includes both on-demand delivery as well as technologies that significantly reduce the logistics burden of operational necessities(food, water, power, medical, etc.). For example, delivery of communications nodes and supplies from the air can reduce/remove ground lines of control (LOCs) and shorten response times.  Innovative approaches to training soldiers in the urban environment can also increase effectiveness, thereby reducing the number of personnel involved in urban operations.   On demand resupply (less than 1 hour for units of operation and within minutes for individual warfighters), with precision (less than 1 meter SEP) delivery by air of tailorable packages (100 pounds to 30,000 pounds), is highly desired.  
10.	Modeling and Simulation: The goal is to provide model and simulation based training through the use of realistic models and simulation tools that are based on current knowledge of the terrain and environment down to the level of individual buildings.  A further goal is to prepare warfighters for managing stability operations and enhance their sensitivity to local non-combatants through the use of large, multi-player games tailored to the region of interest’s culture that can educate about governance, economic development, government services, etc. Proposers should focus on the development of complete systems and/or subsystems that allow new/novel urban warfare tactics/strategies to be applied.  Proposed efforts may address development of enabling components that support new system concepts - however proposed efforts need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems.
11.	Enabling Component Technology:  While the goal of this solicitation is on early system demonstrations, proposals for novel component or subsystem technology that are shown to enable new systems concepts in items 1-10 are also solicited.  Component efforts must clearly describe how they would enable new concepts for WUE and present a transition plan for insertion into a future system demonstration.


In order to achieve the capabilities described above, the FMUOps program will pursue the design, development, integration, and demonstration of critical and enabling technologies and system attributes pertaining to operational Force Multipliers for Urban Area Operations. Offerors should emphasize radical concepts that may contain high technical risk, but if enabled would have commensurate high military payoff.  The Government is not interested in extensions to existing DARPA programs or minor improvements to operational capability.  Rather, DARPA is seeking concepts that will provide either an entirely new military capability or will enhance existing capability by orders of magnitude (based on demonstrable relevant metrics).

Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases. The first phase of six to twelve months duration should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept. Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward technology development.  

II. Award Information 
The Government anticipates multiple Phase I awards, ranging from $50,000 to $400,000. The Offeror is expected to provide a realistic technical and cost proposal for best achieving the program objectives within the outlined budget and schedule.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in FMUOps technology. 
Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Section II, I. of the proposal, organized by task and year.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371).

However, BAA 04-31, Force Multipliers for Urban Area Operations will remain open until 1600 (ET) Friday, June 17, 2005. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through June 17, 2005. While the proposals submitted after the October 6, 2004, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.

4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Proposers must obtain the BAA 04-31 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-31 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

V. Application Review Information

1.  Criteria (listed in descending order of relative importance): 
1.	Technical Approach
The technical approach of the proposer should address every aspect of the effort.  In particular, the following items will be considered and evaluated:
•	Innovation and Realism
•	Understanding of the Problem
•	Scalability
2.	Potential Contribution And Relevance To The DARPA  Force Multipliers For Urban Area Operations Mission
The potential contributions of the proposed effort with relevance to the national technology base will be evaluated.
3.	Offeror’s Capabilities And Related Experience
The qualifications of the Principal Investigators will be considered.  The range, depth, and mix of expertise of the Offeror’s key personnel will be evaluated to ensure that they are qualified in the theory and application of the technologies involved in the research, development, testing and evaluation of the proposed technology.
4.	Approach/Ability To Technology Transition
The capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense.
5.	Cost Realism
The objective of this criterion is to establish that the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic for the technical and management approach offered, as well as to determine the proposer’s practical understanding of the effort.  This will be principally measured by cost per labor-hour and number of labor-hours proposed.  The evaluation criterion recognize that undue emphasis on cost may motivate proposers to offer low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel in order to be in a more competitive posture.  DARPA discourages such cost strategies.  Cost reduction approaches that will be received favorably include innovative management concepts that maximize direct funding for technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.
2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
  
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only.”   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).


VI. Award Administration Information

1.  Award Notices

Principal Investigators will receive a letter informing them of the disposition of their proposal via U.S. mail.  

2.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Proposers may wish to visit DARPA’s Contracts Management Office (CMO) website (http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/modelgrantagreement.htm) for model grant and cooperative agreement terms and conditions.

3.  Reporting
The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).

Additional details of post-award reporting requirements are contained in the Proposer Information Pamphlet.  The DARPA/CMO website referenced above also provides general information about reports required specifically for grants and cooperative agreements.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED.  A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS A COMPETITIVE  8(A) SET-ASIDE.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 and the small business size standard is average annual receipts for the proceeding three fiscal years not in excess of $6 million.   The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is CLOSEOUTFY04.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide assistance in closing out expired Federal Government Contracts, Task Orders, Delivery Orders and Simplified Acquisitions throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) including all regional offices and Operating Divisions (OPDIV’s).  The DHHS has ten (10) regions as follows: Region I - serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.  Region II - serving New York , New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.  Region III - serving Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and District of Columbia.  Region IV - serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.  Region V -  serving Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Region VI - serving Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.  Region VII - serving Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.  Region VIII - serving Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.  Region IX - serving Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Guam, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and American Samoa and Region X - serving Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.  The following OPDIV’s are located throughout the regions listed above.  Administration for Children and Families (ACF); Administration on Aging (AoA); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); Food and Drug Administration (FDA);  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); Indian Health Service (IHS); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Program Support Center (PSC) and  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Offices that have closeout activity are mainly within the Washington, DC area, but are also located throughout the United States.  As the principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing critical and essential human services, the HHS has embarked on a major initiative in support of HHS Secretary Thompson’s goals and the President’s Management Agenda in a “one” Department wide challenge.  This involves bringing together diverse activities which will result in coordinated systems for managing programs.  Directing a concerted effort to standardize various components within the department is essential in achieving the “one” Department goal.  In particular, standardization in the acquisition arena within each OPDIV is of particular interest which entails consistent approaches to various acquisition policies and procedures.  This standardization provides for a unified front across the agency and also allows for increased efficiency and reduced overhead.  In an effort to initiate some of these processes,  senior management officials and other representatives from each OPDIV of HHS met and collectively designed a set of proposed actions for acquisition consolidation.  More specifically, the focus is on the “closeout function” within the acquisition cycle. The closeout function, while required as part of administration, is often an overlooked activity because considerable time and resources are devoted to awarding contracts, rather than closing them out.  Thus a backlog of expired contracts can easily develop as a result of the resource distribution devoted to the award phase and other administrative activities.  The Department currently has approximately 30,000 files that need to be closed and they include the following types: Firm Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, Cost Reimbursement /Task Order, Fixed-Price/Task Order, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Time-Material/Task Orders, Simplified Acquisition, Delivery Order (FSS/IDIQ), Fixed-Price SBIR Phase 1.   The objective of this HHS Wide Contact acquisition is to acquire one or multiple Contractors who will provide on-site (Government location) and/or off-site (Contractor facility) closeout services related to the physical & administrative completion of expired contracts. The Government reserves the right to determine if more that one contract will be awarded for the required services.  The period of performance shall be from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005, with four 12-month option periods.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) of the Government’s intent to solicit for potential sources for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 through FY 06.  The Government intends to compete and award the entire Air Force Summer Faculty Program by 29 September 2004 with one option as stated herein. Furthermore a formal Request for Proposal via the Federal Business (FEDBIZOps) web site (http://www.eps.gov) for potential sources for the SFFP as described herein will be announced on or around 1 July 2004 from the United States Air Force, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) seeking a qualified contractor for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship Program (SFFP) for FY 05 with one option for FY 06.    In 1979, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) initiated the Summer Faculty Research Program (SFRP) to introduce research faculty into Air Force laboratory facilities across the US.  The intent of the program has been to bolster research efforts and build critical links between Air Force scientists and their counterparts in the academic community.  The original SFRP was concluded in 1999 and a new program, the Summer Faculty Fellowship Program replaced it.  Under the SFFP, US College, university, or technical institute faculty members (known as SFFP fellows) perform mentor-based research in areas of interest to the Air Force in Air Force research facilities. The objectives of the program are to: 
1)	Provide the fellows high-quality, meaningful, mentor-based research at AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
2)	 Provide the fellows opportunities to stimulate professional relationships among the scientists and engineers in AFRL Technical Directorates and other Air Force research facilities
3)	Enhance the research interests and capabilities of faculty in the US academic community
4)	Elevate the awareness of the US academic community of Air Force research needs 
During the summer, the fellows, under the mentorship of AF researchers, will conduct research at Air Force research facilities for a period of eight (8) to twelve (12) weeks.  AFOSR intends to award between forty (40) to one hundred (100) awards per year with awards restricted to university faculty members with PhDs in science, mathematics, or engineering and who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. To be considered qualified for this effort; prospective sources must demonstrate detailed knowledge and experience in the following areas:

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new Court House for the Federal District Courts in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  This project will have a principal emphasis on site development, new construction and infrastructure improvements. The building is approximately 20,500 gross square meters (224,000 gross square feet) including 35 interior parking spaces, on a Government owned site located within the Central Business District of Toledo, Ohio.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is $60 million to $70 million.  The facility will be designed in hard metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: site and building design, metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a Federal Court House that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, indoor parking, site development, client program development, socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This project is to include GSA design standards for secure facilities and U.S. Marshals Service construction and security requirements, U.S.Courts Design Guide, as well as specific tenant-agency security requirements.  This building will be an anchor development in the neighborhood and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the overall urban design, quality of life and shall be consistent with the historic site concept of the Toledo Civic Center Mall.  The project will provide a facility that meets energy goals and includes sustainable design and construction practices (LEED). This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm as defined as in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building’s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction for GSA.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ for Stage I. The Government may provide a stipend for Stage II (Charrette), which will be determined at a later date.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the Fed Biz Opps announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) modified to include only the A/E’s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer’s ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria #3, the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project. (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer’s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the-art Courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment. (3) Past Performance on Design (25%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client’s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section. (4) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, a representative of the client and professional representatives from GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage the entire project team, including the A/E firms selected in the first stage, their designated Lead Designers and ALL the consultants who will work on the project will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  A brief period, approximately 3weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  In developing the Stage II project team, A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the state of Ohio.  The Selection Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan.  The Stage II evaluations will require an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board and will culminate with a one day Design Charrette on the day following the interviews. The purpose of the Design Charette is to further evaluate the design merits of each Designer’s “Vision”. The design Charette results will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A/E firm. The Design Charrette results will be evaluated by a jury of GSA Peer Professionals. The evaluation criteria to be used by the jury shall include: community context, architectural strategy and image, courthouse functionality and sustainable design. The submitted design concepts become the property of the Government. Associated plans, drawings or specifications provided under this solicitation are intended for use by prospective bidders/offerors (and their subcontractors and suppliers). In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to building drawings/plans, security equipment, security equipment installations, and contract guard service, to include: 1) Limiting reproduction and/or dissemination of covered materials only to persons/parties related to this acquisition or otherwise authorized to receive such information; 2) Making every possible effort that is reasonable and prudent to prevent unauthorized disclosure of this information; 3) Upon award and completion of any appeals process, unsuccessful bidders/offerors making every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all information/documentation received during the solicitation and/or appeals process; and 4) The awardee continuing the efforts required above throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the “awardee”

<DESC>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) to MD Robotics for the development of a robotic grapple arm and a double-armed dexterous robot that would be needed to accomplish the hardware exchange during a potential spaceflight mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), called the HST Robotic Servicing and De-orbit Mission (HRSDM).	NASA is contemplating conducting either the HRSDM or a mission for disposal only of the HST.	If the HRSDM is approved, it must be accomplished before HST systems fail and the observatory goes into a scientifically useless tumble mode.  All analysis and estimates set the timeframe for those system failures to begin to occur in late Calendar Year 2007.  Therefore, the launch schedule for the HRSDM would be December 2007.  The only known system with the high level of maturity needed to meet the critical HRSDM schedule requirements for integration, test, training, and launch is the MD Robotics Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) Robot and Space Transportation System (STS)/Orbital Express (OE) robotic arm system, including respective packages of embedded flight software.	Both of these system elements have been developed, tested, and provided for the International Space Station (ISS).  In addition, the MD Robotics grapple arm has been developed and used for the Space Shuttle, and has also been developed for DARPA’s Orbital Express mission, which will demonstrate autonomous rendezvous and capture of a target vehicle. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". See Notes 22 and 26. Statuatory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules, may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  Award of a contract as a result of the above-described RFP is contingent upon the availability of funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for approximately 150 Tomahawk Block IV Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) Capsules.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS)  P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ  85734-1337.  RMS is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer of the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV Missile.  RMS currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  RMS is responsible for maintaining the existing capsules and performing any required re-certification, repair, refurbishment or remanufacture of them.  RMS is the only source that possesses the current technical, configuration, manufacturing data, and unique expertise required to produce a CCLS capsule capable of complying with the Tactical Tomahawk Block IV configuration.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to provide these CCLS Capsules, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of cost.

EVALUATION FACTORS:  PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT TEAM; EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE OF THE PROJECT TEAM; PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE KEY PERSONNEL; EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE OF THE KEY PERSONNEL; PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PROCEDURES OF THE FIRM.  The importance and weighting of the non-price factors in relation to price has yet to be determined by the source selection authority.  OPTIONS:  Outdoor Signage, Sculptured Animals, Graphics and Props.  The government will evaluate price proposals for award purposes (inclusive of options) by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement to determine the overall evaluated price.  The estimated range of this project is $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  This project is subject to the Service Contract Act.  Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes.  Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror".

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST),  Magnetic Technology Division of Boulder, Colorado proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Colorado to perform electromechanical measurements of the effect of strain on the critical current of  low-Tc and high-Tc superconductors.  The goal is to determine the stress sensitivity of the high-field Nb3Sn superconductors for fusion and high-energy-physics-accelerator magnet programs, as well as obtain data for the new experimental YBCO coated conductors.  Another major project will be to develop and commission a rather complex neon liquefier system.  Work will also include a study of field-dependent electrical conductivity in carbon nanostructures.  The measurements are to be performed at NIST cryostats.  The staff at the University of Colorado has a combination of skills and past experience in cryogenic-system design, handling of cryogenic fluids, and operation of both high and low current sources.  The staff also has knowledge of conduction properties of both superconductors and carbon nanostructures and their analysis/interpretation are essential.  Specific work tasks will include measuring the effect of strain on the critical-current of brittle superconducting materials, designing, commissioning, and testing a neon liquefier system, as well as magneto-resistance measurements of nanostructures.  In the case of superconductors, analysis of the data will be performed in terms of the Strain Scaling Law and deviatoric strain models, and in the case of carbon nanostructures, initial results should clarify issues on (directional) superficial conductivity at the walls of nanotubes, and possibly on ballistic conductivity.  The contract period is August 2, 2004 through July 31, 2005.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned..  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm.

<DESC>The North Cascades Stehekin Lodge (Lodge) is protected by an Edwards System Technology (EST 3) fire detection and alarm system that was installed in 1994. The system consists of sensors, detectors, and annunciators throughout several buildings that are connected to a central control panel in the old Stehekin Ranger Station. In 2003 the NPS rehabilitated the nearby Golden West Visitor Center and connected and attempted to interface a new Edwards System Technology fire alarm and detection system in that building to the existing EST 3 system in the Lodge. The interface was only partially successful in that some of the operations of the Lodge system cannot be monitored or controlled from the Golden West.  The National Park Service is seeking offers for a firm, fixed-price contract to furnish all labor, materials, equipment, and expertise necessary to make these two systems fully integrated, with monitoring and controllability from the Golden West.  All design work shall be performed by a certified professional Fire Protection Engineer who is authorized and certified to work on Edwards System Technology products.  All installation work shall be performed by an individual who is recognized by the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) Fire Alarm Systems, as a minimum Level III certified technician, in accordance with NFPA 72, who is licensed by the State of Washington to perform such work, who has been involved in such work for at least the last five years, and who is certified to work on Edwards System Technology products.  Contract duration is 75 days following issuance of the Notice to Proceed, with a target completion date of September 30, 2004. LOCATION:  Stehekin is a remote community located 50 miles from Chelan, Washington, at the north end of Lake Chelan.  The Stehekin valley is isolated; the roads do not connect with any highway system.  Stehekin is accessible from Chelan only by float plane, boat or barge; all materials and equipment will need to be barged.  Within the Stehekin valley, the Lodge and Golden West are within walking distance of each other.  Lodging and meals are available on a limited basis.  Cellular phones do not work and there is no public Internet access.   SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement open to Edwards-certified business concerns of all sizes.  The NAICS code for this project is 561621 and the small business size standard is $10.5 million.  The estimated price range for this service contract is between $25,000 and $100,000.  The electronic solicitation will be made available to qualified vendors on or about June 28, 2004.   To receive the solicitation, send an e-mail to sarah_welch@nps.gov that includes your business name, DUNS number, point of contact, and a brief statement of your qualifications.  Offers will be due on July 21, 2004.  Plan ahead - Federal Express does not deliver to our office.

The services will be performed by Tougaloo's staff and students.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

Capability statements and any other information must be in writing and received in the contracing office by 2:00 PM EDT, on June 30, 2004.  For further information please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects will be accepted.  NAICS Code 611710.

<SUBJECT>B -- ELLIPTIC FOURIER ANALYSES OR TORSO SHAPE INFORMATION FOR FALL-PROTECTION-HARNESS DESIGN
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-000HCCB7-2004-09941
<RESPDATE>063004

<DESC>ELLIPTIC FOURIER ANALYSES OF TORSO SHAPE INFORMATION FOR
FALL-PROTECTION-HARNESS DESIGN


The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) seeks to utilize a vendor to conduct a study on construction workers anthropometry for fall protective harness design and sizing system evaluation.  

The scope is to conduct a series of analyses based on the Elliptic Fourier (EF) procedure to define key factors of torso shape variation, identify shape characteristics that are likely to cause harness fit problems, and ultimately use the extracted shape coefficients to develop 3D models of improved fall protection harnesses.  A database of 216 subjects established by NIOSH will be used for the project.  The database will be returned to NIOSH once the project is completed.  The NIOSH database contains the coded information of gender (2 categories), ethnic group/race (4 categories), harness type (2 categories), the best fit harness size (4 categories), 3D torso scans (3 categories – without harness, with overhead harness, and with vest harness), and traditional anthropometric measurements (29 dimensions).  A full set of the database will be available to the awardee for the task.  The contractor is to report, in lay language, (1) the key factors for accommodation of fall harnesses, (2) the key anthropometric dimensions for the correct assignment of a harness size, (3) a suggested sizing scheme (i.e., how many sizes are needed), (4) a suggested sizing chart (i.e., the range for each key parameter), and (5) how to apply the results to CAESAR (Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometric Resource) database in harness design practice.  A technical report is required which includes the results from the above-mentioned steps.  Raw data and processed data and processed data are to be enclosed in electronic forms.  They should be retrievable with common multimedia, graphical, or statistical packages.  Reports are to be provided to the Project Officer in both hard copy (1 copy) and electronic formats (in Word file formats).  NIOSH reserves the right to publish the analysis results first.  Subsequent publications and presentation by the contractor are subject to NIOSH review prior to release.  The period of performance for this contract shall not exceed 4 months from the date of contract award

This project is currently supported by a sole-source justification with Anthrotech, Inc., 503 Xenia Avenue, Yellow Springs, OH  45387.

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist.  Through this announcement, organizations are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate to the Government their qualifications and capabilities to provide the stated services.

Much has been written, reported, and documented about the now infamous study, “The Tuskegee Syphilis Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male,” which was conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service from 1932-1972. The Syphilis Study Website, currently available on-line at www.tuskegeemcc.org, was the THCRMCC’s initial effort at overcoming a lack of public awareness of the program by including archival material from the study.  However, a website alone, without effective outreach and awareness programs, is unlikely to achieve two vital objectives:   to disseminate widely the facts and lessons to be learned from these events and to highlight the ongoing problem of syphilis in current society.  The intent of the current project is to preserve the history and lessons of the U.S. Public Health Service’s Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the Negro male (1932 – 1972).  Under this Statement of Work,  CDC will seek to broaden public awareness of the Center and its programs, the syphilis study itself, and the ongoing problem of syphilis  The existing website will be expanded and the associated information system hardware and software updated and maintained as necessary.

<SUBJECT>S -- Electric Utility Distribution System Privatization at Fort Hood, Texas
<SOLNBR>SP0600-04-R-0101
<CONTACT>Kimberly Binns, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 767-8422, Fax (703) 767-8506, Email kimberly.binns@dla.mil - Kerri Chambers, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-767-8567, Fax 703-767-2382, Email kerri.chambers@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric distribution system at Fort Hood, Texas.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:  Installation: Fort Hood  Location: Fort Hood, Texas  Installation Description:  Fort Hood is located in central Texas, approximately 65 miles north of Austin and approximately 20 miles west of Interstate Highway 35 along U.S. Highway 190. The Post covers approximately 339 square miles, straddling Coryell and Bell counties and abutted to the east by the City of Killeen, Texas and to the west by the City of Copperas Cove, Texas.
Fort Hood consists of the five major areas: Main Cantonment area, West Fort Hood, North Fort Hood, maneuver and live-training areas (the Ranges), and the Belton Lake Outdoor Recreation Area (BLORA). The Main Cantonment area represents the original site for South Camp Hood. The site was originally selected in 1941 and construction started 1942. South Camp Hood was designated as Fort Hood in 1951. 
Construction of North Camp Hood, which is now known as North Fort Hood, started shortly thereafter. North Fort Hood is located approximately 17 miles to the north of the Main Cantonment area. Approximately 244 square miles of land between North Fort Hood and the Main Cantonment area is used for maneuvers and live fire exercises. Fort Hood has two active airfields: Hood Army Airfield and Robert Gray Airfield. Hood Army Airfield is located on the eastern edge of the Cantonment area and Robert Gray Airfield is located on West Fort Hood. BLORA is located on the eastern-most portion of Fort Hood. 
Fort Hood’s primary mission is to prepare both active and reserve military components for deployment and execution of military and domestic missions worldwide. The Post is distinctive in that it is the only military installation in the United States capable of stationing and training two armored divisions. A major element of Fort Hood’s mission is derived from its extensive training areas. The maneuver and training areas within the Ranges are used to simulate battlefield conditions and support infantry, armor, artillery, and air training operations.
Fort Hood has privatized the military family housing villages on the Post.  The exception is Liberty Village (300 units), which is leased housing.
The Villages of Montague, Comanche I, Comanche II, Comanche III, Kouma, Pershing, Venable, McNair, Chaffee, Wainwright, Patton, and Walker were privatized on 1 October 2001 and were transferred to a limited partnership, Fort Hood Family Housing (FHFH).  FHFH is renovating existing housing units, constructing 974 new housing units, and demolishing approximately 368 existing housing units over the first 5 years of the 50-year base contract period.
As of 1 December 2003, new construction has been completed on Comanche II Infill (36 units); Kouma 2a, 2b, 2c (224 units); Montague 3 (146 units); and Comanche 3a Infill (80 units).  Construction is ongoing in Comanche 4 (326 units).  The approved final construction plans for Montague 4 (80 units) and Comanche 5 (16 units) are expected to be awarded before 31 January 2004.
Six units have been demolished and an additional 26 units will be demolished as a part of the Comanche 5 project.  The 336 units in Walker Village are expected to be demolished in the 2005-2006 timeframe.
All Star Maintenance maintains the privatized housing for FHFH.  Actus-Lend Lease is the design and construction contractor (new houses, renovations, and demolition) for FHFH.  The FHFH Partnership (includes Army) owns and depreciates the supporting utility infrastructure that it installs.  The Army agreed to operate and maintain this infrastructure.  In order to comply with requirements of the FHFH Partnership after utility privatization, the Army has included in this solicitation's scope the requirement to operate and maintain this infrastructure that will continue to be owned by the FHFH Partnership, and shall be titled “Government Retained” property.
	
 Utility System to be privatized:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations. 
a.	Electrical Distribution System  
The electric distribution system on Fort Hood is used to deliver electricity from the supplier to each end user throughout the Post. The system serves approximately 4,889 facilities on the Main Cantonment area, 324 facilities on West Fort Hood, 305 facilities on North Fort Hood, and 33 facilities at BLORA. The electric system also supports the range and maneuver areas. 
Fort Hood’s electric distribution consists of primary and secondary circuits that are both overhead on utility poles and underground in concrete encased conduit, direct buried conduit or direct buried conductor. The distribution system is constructed with numerous switches allowing loop capability to provide backup in the event of feeder outages
The Main Cantonment Substation is located at the intersection of Hood Road and Tank Destroyer Boulevard. Four Texas Utilities (TXU-Oncor)-owned transformers in the substation transform the energy to the Fort Hood 12.47-kV 3-phase 4-wire distribution system. On the secondary of each of the four transformers is a totalizing breaker, which feeds the station bus. The station is an open-air insulated design utilizing a main and transfer bus configuration. Sixteen feeder breakers supply the feeders, which emanate from the substation. The point of demarcation between the TXU-Oncor and Fort Hood systems is the line side bushing connections of the totalizing breaker located between the TXU-Oncor-owned transformers and the Fort Hood main and transfer bus.
The West Fort Hood Substation (also known as the Clear Creek substation) is located southeast of the Montague II military family housing area along Ammo Road. Similar to the Main Cantonment substation, two TXU-Oncor-owned transformers in the substation transform the energy to the Fort Hood 12.47-kV 3-phase 4-wire distribution system. On the secondary of each of the two transformers is a totalizing breaker, which feeds the station bus. The station is an open-air insulated design utilizing a main and transfer bus configuration. Eight feeder breakers supply the feeders emanating from the station to serve facilities on West Fort Hood and the west side of the Main Cantonment area. The point of demarcation between the TXU-Oncor and Fort Hood systems is the line side bushing connections of the totalizing breaker located between the TXU-Oncor-owned transformers and the Fort Hood main and transfer bus.
The North Fort Hood Substation is located at the corner of 15th Street and Headquarters Avenue. The one TXU-Oncor-owned transformer in the substation transforms the energy to the Fort Hood 12.47-kV 3-phase 4-wire distribution system. The secondary of the transformers feeds across to the Fort Hood bus through a group operated air switch. The station is an open-air insulated design utilizing a main and transfer bus configuration. Three feeder breakers supply the feeders emanating from the station to serve facilities at the far northern portions of the Post. The point of demarcation between the TXU-Oncor and Fort Hood systems is the line side connection to the knife switch located between the TXU-Oncor owned disconnect switch and the Fort Hood owned disconnect switch between the TXU-Oncor-owned totalizing breaker and the Fort Hood feeder breakers.
One new switching station and substation has been designed and will be under construction or completed by the time this contract is awarded.  The switching station will be located just South of Highway 190 along Clark road and the substation will be located just East of Clark Road between A.T. & S.F. R.R. and Tank Destroyer Blvd. The switching station will consist of one SF6 138-kV circuit breaker, and isolating switches. The substation will be of similar design as the Main Cantonment and West Fort Hood substations. Two Fort Hood owned transformers in the substation will transform the energy to 12.47-kV 3-phase 4-wire. On the secondary of each of the two transformers will be a circuit breaker and capacitor bank and totalizing breaker, which will feed the station bus. The station will be an open-air insulated design utilizing a main and transfer bus configuration. Five feeder breakers will supply the feeders, which will emanate from the new substation. There will be four spare feeder breaker bays and room for an additional transformer, sectionalizing breaker, capacitor bank and four feeder breakers. The point of demarcation will be the supply side of the isolation switch, which isolates the new 138-kV SF6 circuit breaker in the new switching station from the TXU-Oncor 138-kV transmission line.
The TVOR site is located in West Fort Hood just South of Mayberry Road. This is an aviation navigation facility owned by Fort Hood and receives power through a short (approximately 3,000 feet) section of primary overhead distribution circuit served by Bartlet CO-OP. The point of demarcation for the TVOR circuit is the line side connection to the fused cutout on the Bartlet circuit serving the short section of primary feeder to the TVOR facility. Note: The meter located at the facility is owned by Bartlet CO-OP
The BLORA site is located in the Southeast corner of Fort Hood just South of Belton Lake. This is a recreational facility which receives power from a short section of primary overhead distribution circuit served by TXU-Oncor. The point of demarcation for BLORA is the load side of the fused disconnect switch located one span down stream of the metering pole at the post perimeter access gate on N. Nolan Road.
The Fort Hood electric distribution system being studied consists of all components from the point where the Post takes ownership from the supplier to the point where electricity is supplied to end-users

Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Fort Polk, Louisiana.  System Descriptions: Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater.
The Fort Polk Military Installation is located in Vernon Parish in west-central Louisiana adjacent to Leesville, Louisiana. The Army owns approximately 100,009 acres of land at the Main Post and at the Peason Ridge Training Area, located about 15 miles north of the Main Post. The Installation also maintains a small site on the eastern shore of Toledo Bend Reservoir that is used as a recreation site for military personnel and their families. Additionally, the Army utilizes about 98,125 acres of land owned by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The Main Post has two distinct developed areas that contain buildings, motor pools, and other facilities. These areas are known as the North and South Fort Cantonment Areas or North Fort and South Fort. There are 2,384 buildings on Fort Polk (1,679, permanent; 255 semi-permanent; and 450 temporary). These buildings enclose a total of 15,572,096 square feet (SF) of floor space. Included in these totals are 1,163 permanent family housing buildings containing 3,424 family dwelling units encompassing a total of 6,955,318 SF.
Electric System.  A total of 13 distribution feeders supply primary voltage to loads throughout the post.  Two 13.8/7.92 kV feeders and two 4.16/2.4 kV feeders originate at the North Fort Substation, and supply loads in the North Fort area.  Nine 13.8/7.92 kV feeders originate at Substation No. 2 and supply loads in the South Fort area. The majority of the existing facilities are of overhead construction.  The majority of the underground facilities are located in family housing areas, although most newer service extensions also have been constructed with underground facilities, as have feeders in and around the airfields and in the active portions of the range areas.  For the Peason Ridge and Toledo Bend satellite locations, the Government owns only low-voltage secondary distribution and lighting circuits.  Power is provided to both locations from Valley Electric Cooperative.   Fort Polk proper has approximately 3 million LF of conductors (80% overhead; 20% underground).  Peason Ridge has approximately 80,000 LF of underground conductors; Toledo Bend has only about 1,000 LF of overhead conductors.
Natural gas system.  Natural gas is currently supplied to Fort Polk by two gas companies at three delivery points. United Gas Company supplies natural gas to North Fort Polk and South Fort Polk areas, and Entex serves the Bayne-Jones Memorial Hospital. The 8-inch diameter pipeline that serves South Fort Polk can deliver 40,000 million cubic feet (mcf) per day, while the 8-inch diameter line that serves the North Fort Polk area can deliver more than 15,000 mcf/day at 200 psig.  Nearly all of the distribution lines are polyethylene (PE) gas pipe and are in very good condition.  The network includes approximately 300,000 LF of pipe ranging from 2” to 8”.  There are no natural gas components at Peason Ridge or Toledo Bend.
Potable water system.  Fort Polk’s potable water system consists of water wells, treatment plants, pumping stations, water storage tanks (including obstruction lights), distribution pipes, valves and fire hydrants. There are three large independent water systems on the Fort Polk main cantonment areas, and multiple, small, stand-alone systems. There are also two, small satellite location water systems (distribution only; water is purchased) at Peason Ridge and Toledo Bend. The system includes 12 active deep wells, 15 large tanks (elevated and ground storage) totaling approximately 7.5 million gallons, and approximately 600,000 LF of pipe ranging from 2” to 14”.
Wastewater system.  The wastewater system at Fort Polk includes service laterals, manholes, collection mains, lift stations, force mains, and treatment plants. Fort Polk proper has two independent collection and treatment systems.  The North Fort plant is permitted to discharge 1.4 MGD; the South Fort Plant is permitted to discharge 3.8 MGD. The wastewater collection system (pipe sizes range from 4” to 20”) consists of approximately 400,000 LF of gravity collection lines, 40,000 LF of force mains, and approximately 15 lift stations.  Peason Ridge and Toledo Bend have small collection systems and three-cell lagoon systems for treatment. Toledo All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS-04P-04-EXC-0032 – Greenville, South Carolina, GSA contracting officer phone number - 404-331-4616.

Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New U. S. Federal Courthouse to be constructed in Greenville, South Carolina in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 21 158 gross square meters (gsm)  227,747 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 23 908 gsm  257,347 gsf including 74 interior parking spaces.  The proposed courthouse will provide a total of eight (8) courtrooms: - six (6) district, and two (2) magistrate courtrooms.  The building will house the Circuit, District, and Magistrate Courts; U. S. Attorney; U. S. Marshals Service; U. S. Probation; U. S. Pretrial Service; Public Defenders; and GSA.  The proposed facility will be constructed in Greenville, SC with the exact site still to be determined.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $45 million to $55 million 

The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the construction of a new building and related systems, inside parking, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The building is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Services; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U. S. Marshal’s design requirements, the U. S. Attorney’s Office design requirements and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design. The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.  GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Management (CM) and/or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services.  The CM/CMc will be involved in the design process to provide:  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews.  The CMc may continue with construction by separately procuring subcontracts for construction.

<CONTACT>Donald B. Ellison, Contracting Officer 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes the second amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 originally published on 27 MAR 2002 and amended on 28 JUN 2002.  This second amendment is being issued in response to questions received from industry concerning the DRAFT Performance Specification for pending solicitation number N00164-02-R-0014.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on 16 OCT 2002. The formal solicitation has not yet been issued. 2.  INDUSTRY QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:   References cited in this amendment are from revision Preliminary 10 of the draft Performance Specification dated 21 June 2002.  The applicable questions and answers are as follows: QUESTION NO. 1:    3.2.12 Are DL-123 batteries acceptable for Group B Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1:  The performance s pecification neither requires nor precludes the use of any specific battery; however, any battery chosen must be common and commercially available. QUESTION NO. 2:  3.2.15 Is an “all in one package” more desirable than the modular approach currently utilized? ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 2:   Any proposed “all-in-one” solution must meet all of the KPP’s for each of the subsystems it is combining.  APP’s are, by definition, tradable.  Combined systems will be evaluated based on risks and benefits that the solution will provide the operator.  An all-in-one solution may or may not be more desirable.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 3:     3.3.2.1.2.8  At what point does the VBL become too bright?   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 3:  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) specifies  a minimum range of visible illumination, but does not include any specifications for luminosity.  Life Cycle Sustainment costs will be considered during the source selection process; therefore, the systems should be designed to be as efficient as possible and still meet the performance specifications. QUESTION NO. 4:    3.3.2.2.2.1 Is the “double tap” feature of the AN/PEQ-2 Pressure Pad acceptable for a constant  on function?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 4:  The ORD has not changed since the AN/PEQ-2 was fielded.  Improvements on the current design will be considered.  A “double tap” feature may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 5:    3.3.2.2  Is a high-power illuminating (100 mw output) laser desired for sniper applications?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 5:  Sniper applications for infrared pointing, illuminating, and aiming capability are not within the scope of the upcoming solicitation.  There is no requirement for a 100mw laser; however, specific applications for pointing out to 5km in limited quantities are anticipated as separated contract line items.  The performance specification will be updated to reflect this requirement. QUESTION NO. 6:    3.3.2.2.2.6 Is there a requirement for an IR Illuminator only mode?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 6:  See Performance Specification (Para. 3.3.2.2.2.6) QUESTION NO. 7:    3.3.2.2.2.8 Are low profile adjusters acceptable/preferred as currently incorporated into the  AN/PEQ-2 Model 5000?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 7:  Adjusters will be evaluated on several criteria including, but not limited to, ease of operat ion, snag hazards, glove accessibility, etc.  Low-profile adjusters may or may not be more desirable.  This will be determined by operational and developmental testing.  This is a research solicitation; innovation is encouraged.  A best value determination will be made prior to contract award. QUESTION NO. 8:    3.3.2.3.24  8a. The laser wavelength of 630 +/- 15nm (Red) is specified.  Is Green 535nm acceptable?  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 8a:  The wavelength specan a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SO PMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability  costs, improved reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high  humidity, reduced snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.   A(5)  Backup Iron Sight: implementation of day and night sighting capabilities with an emphasis on light emission control, improved capability to maintain the set position in a combat environment, integration of short and long range capability with improved durability over existing inserts, and reduced snag hazards.  A(6) Rail Interface System:  incorporation of design features which improve overall system performance (possibly floating barrel design concept), improved cleaning and maintenance, improved the durability, and production cost reduction. Group B, Active Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (3) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that  provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(3) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired.  The SOPMOD P rogram desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this capability into a unified system. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives:  Increased user acceptance to include (1) Improved Operation Suitability to include improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  The overall objective is increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions. (2)  Mini aturization, to include reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of firing. (3)  Increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, and ease of cleaning. (4)  Recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms.  Fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective. (5) Functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions. (6) Incorporation of improved safety features. (7) Low optical retro-reflection augmentation. (8) Improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions. (9) Improved lens protection, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers. (10) Improved eye relief whi ch provides optimum performance for SOF combat scenarios and host weapons. (11) Decreased life-cycle support costs. (12)  Improved power consumption, where applicable. (13) Incorporation of night vision capability where it currently does not exist. (14) Improved boresight retention. (15) Consolidation of current capabilities into multi-use systems.  This includes the integration of technologies currently fielded by multiple systems into single multi-use systems and utilization of modular technology, where such combinations are suitable for SOF combat. (16) Improved safety. 5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method. Items will be selected on a "Best Value" Contracting basis. IDIQ contracts will be awarded to offerors in accordance with the following plan: (A)  RCO Solicitation is to be published in July 200 2.  The RCO Solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Be advised that a DRAFT VERSION of the Performance Specification for the proposed procurement is available at the following web link:  http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/02R0014/02R0014.htm .  It is requested that this DRAFT Solicitation be reviewed by interested parties and provide any comments or questions to the Technical Point of Contract (Barry Gatewood) as identified in Paragraph 7 below by July 19, 2002. (B)  Solicitation is planned to close in August 2002.   Upon the closure date and time of the solicitation, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  Functional samples to be u sed during the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations will be delivered prior to commencement of the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations.   (C)  Upon closure of the solicitation, a Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Team (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  An SSB Chairman will be assigned by the SSA to chair the SSB.  All members of the Source Selection Board shall be required to file a Certificate of Non-Disclosure prior to being given access to any of the source selection sensitive material.  A Test Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) will be appointed by the Source Selection Authority (SSA).  The TERP Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.  The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting s cores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.   Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains technical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.  The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Ve ndors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  (D)  Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB will require demonstrations, to include functional demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Representatives from the user community will be asked to participate.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct an adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source  Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award(s).  In order to avoid unreasonable government test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found. (E)  Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.  Product samples are required to comply with key performance parameters (KPP) delineated in the solicitation.  Offerors who submit product samples that do not comply with the KPPs will not be further evaluated.  The samples must meet or exceed the stated thresholds.  These test results and comments will be submitted to the Technical Evaluation Review Panel (TERP). Developmental Testing (DT) will be conducted at NSWC Crane on the product samples to determine compliance with the KPPs, and environmental requirements, and safe to conduct further testing.  Operational Testing (OT) will be conducted by an Independent Validation/Verification Agent.  During OT the operators will determine if the samples meet or exceed the stated thresholds, meet combat suitability and combat effectiveness.  No offerors will be allowed to participate in the OT.  Representatives of the Contracting Officer from NSWC Crane will evaluate offeror(s) past performance and price proposals.  The price evaluation will be presented to the Contracting Officer.  The past performance evaluation will be presented to the TERP. The Contracting Officer/SSA shall use the recommendations and conclusions from the TERP, to include DT and OT analysis, contract management eval uation, past performance, and price evaluations, to derive negotiation strategies and an award determination which will be documented in business clearance memoranda in accordance with the Naval Acquisition Procedure Supplement and NSWC Crane quality assurance guidelines.  The goal is to utilize the same contract vehicles awarded prior to DT/OT for production hardware after this final down-select. 6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem drawings.  7.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A.  The time by which offers must be received is changed from 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. (The closing date, 21APR03, is unchanged.) B.  In Addendum 2 to the solicitation, Page 1 of 5 is corrected to change Item 0000 to Item 0009. C.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the first sentence of Paragraph A.3. is deleted and replaced by the following two sentences:  Separate proposals are required for each MD/NS subsystem being proposed.  Variants within each subsystem may be proposed within that subsystem proposal.  Each proposal shall include five (5) copies of Volume 1 and two (2) copies of Volume 2, 3 and 4. D.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the second sentence of Parag raph D is deleted and replaced by the following: If the offeror is a small business, this volume shall describe the extent to which your company has identified and committed to provide for participation by small, small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), woman owned businesses (WOB), historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions for the performance of this effort.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the tasks assigned the selected small and/or SDB and WOB subcontractors are meaningful in the sense that they will be performing functions important to the overall success of the program and also broaden the subcontractor's technical capability.   The offeror shall describe their management approach for enhancing small, SDB and WOB subcontractor's technical capability.   Of special interest is the amount and type of  work to be performed by the subcontractors.  The offeror shall explain the reasons for and advantages of selecting particular subcontractors. E.  The solicitation states that “Initial inspection of the required supplies shall be performed by the cognizant DCMA and/or NSWC personnel at the contractor’s/sub-contractor’s facility.  Final inspection and acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane.”  This statement applies to all deliveries on the future contracts including prototypes and production hardware. F.  Additional details concerning the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations (as set forth in Addendum 3) are as follows: Oral Presentation/Demonstration:  Formal scheduling of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The Government will notify each offeror of the date and time of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration at least two  weeks prior to the scheduled date.  The number of offeror representatives for each Oral Presentation/Demonstration shall not exceed six.  In order to facilitate the source selection process, the Government intends to schedule the Oral Presentation/Demonstration by MDNS subsystem rather than by offeror.  Offerors shall have up to 2 hours to present Powerpoint presentations, conduct any product demonstrations, and allow for a question and answer period.  It is anticipated that it will be possible for offerors to conduct limited operational demonstrations of passive devices, visible bright lights, and Class 3A lasers.  The Government is currently investigating the possibility of more detailed demonstrations at a range yet to be determined.   G.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification, which are attached and available  for downloading.  The SOW and Performance Specification were originally published as Addendum 1, Section 2 and Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information shown below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached SOW and Performance Specification.

ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 43: See P erformance Specification, it describes the objective system.  QUESTION NO. 44:  While the Passive MDNS section makes allowances for providing improvements to the Rail Interface System, the Active MDNS for which we plan to submit makes no allowances for an improved RIS.  It would appear to be in the Government's best interests to not limit manufacturers to similarly submit improvements to the RIS under the Active MDNS subsystem as well.  ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 44:  Manufacturers are free to submit proposals on any of the nine subsystems or any combination thereof.  The division of subsystems into active and passive groups was for organizational purposes only and was not intended to imply that proposals be submitted for the entire group. QUESTION NO. 45:  Section 3.3 SOPMOD Technology Requirements describes "Supplemental specifications" as existing capabilities, however late r under 3.3.2 Group B Active Miniature Day / Night Subsystems the "Supplemental Specifications are termed as minimum performance characteristics, i.e. threshold requirements.  This appears to be a conflict.  It is our interpretation the Supplemental specifications are not threshold requirements for this solicitation.   If these Supplemental specifications contained within the draft solicitation are considered threshold characteristics, they are limiting and overly restrictive.  For examples there are numerous supplemental specifications specifying the exact type of switch based on the existing hardware, the exact location of a switch based on the existing hardware, etc.  These overly restrictive specifications include but are not limited to sections 3.3.2.1.2.2 Switching Devices, Section 3.3.2.1.2.9  makes no allowances for the desire and ability to combine hardware as specifi ed in the ORD (See Wilcox comment 3), 3.3.2.2.2.3.2 Illumination Laser Beam Divergence, 3.3.2.2.2.6 Mode Switch, 3.3.2.2.2.8 Adjusters, 3.3.2.2.2.11 (makes no allowances for combining hardware as in ORD), 3.3.2.3.2.2 Switching Devices, etc.   ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 45:  The specification that will be published with the solicitation has been updated to include designation of KPP’s.  The supplemental specifications not designated as KPP’s are tradable. QUESTION NO. 46:  SOPMOD M4 ORD specifically states the visible laser pointer, visible bright light, infrared pointer and infrared illuminator can be integrated into a single active modular aiming device or a visible and an IR module.  While we have reviewed the draft solicitation, it does not appear to make allowances for the Enhancement of combining all the devices into one system. ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 46:  See Performance  Specification (Para. 3.2.15) 3.

<SUBJECT>10--MINI-DAY/NIGHT SIGHT (MD/NS) DEVELOPMENT
<SOLNBR>N0016402R0014
<RESPDATE>050503
<CONTACT>Don Ellison 812-854-5774
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes an amendment to Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) N00164-02-R-0014 published on 27 March 2002.  This amendment is intended to alert industry of changes in requirements, schedule, and acquisition strategy previously identified in N00164-02-R-0014   This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about July of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental and production items.  In response to market research and user inputs, these may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) with some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optim ized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators.  These MDNS sub-systems have four-fold mission.  MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summariz ed below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems are listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired: Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (2) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (3) ACOG Reflex Sight (4) ACOG 4X Sight (5) Backup Iron Sight (6) Rail Interface System A(1) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):   The CNVD integrates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather tharagraphs.  4) Paragraph 3.2.21 Exterior Finish:  The requirement for exterior finish was changed from flat dark gray to taupe.  Note: Product samples for the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations are exempt from this requirement.  5) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.2  Reticle:  Threshold and objective ranges were added to the ballistic compensating reticle.  6) Paragraph 3.3.1.1.1.2.4   Eye Relief:  The ECOS eye relief has been corrected to read 1.4 inches to 3.0 inches.  7) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.1.3  Weight:  The CNVD Objective Weight requirement was raised to 22 ounces.  8) Paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.2.1  Scope Compatibility:  The CNVD Scope compatibility table was changed to all APPs.  9) Paragraph 3.3.2.1.1.1.4 Battery Removal:  The requirement for batteries to be able to be replaced by the operator with one hand, without using tools, and without removing the MDNS subsystem from the host weapon was deleted for the VBL III.  10) Paragraph 3.4.1.3 Electromagnetic Performance Parameters:  This paragraph was improperly labeled 3.4.2.  Additionally, the Table was incorrectly identified.  11) Paragraph 3.4.2 Environmental Requirements:  Minor errors were corrected.  Also, the requirement for a MIL-STD-810 Rain Test were removed.  12) Paragraph 3.4.4 Fi ring Schedules:  A clause was added to allow for simulated weapon shock/recoil using shock profiles to be used to validate this requirement.  The requirement was also clarified to include all MDNS subsystems.  13) Paragraph 3.7.2 Labeling:  An exception to the labeling requirements was given for backup iron sights and rail interface systems.  14)  Paragraph 3.7.5  Oil, Solvent, and Other Chemical Compatibility: A reference to the maintenance manual was changed to reflect the correct terminology “Operator’s Manual”.  15) Paragraph 4.3 Operational Testing (OT):  Minor changes to the test methodology were incorporated.  16) Paragraph 6.1 Operator’s Manual:  Further clarification was provided for minimum requirements for the Operator’s Manual.  K.  Changes to the GO/NO CRITERIA (as set forth in Addendum 3 to the solicitation) are as shown below:   1) The CNVD Scope  Compatibility requirement was eliminated as a GO/NO GO CRITERIA due to a change in the Performance Specification requirements.   2) The RIS II Interoperability Performance Specification paragraph number was corrected from 3.3.1.5.1 to 3.1.2.6 within the GO/NO GO CRITERIA.   3) For the CVL II, a Markings category similar to the ITPIAL II requirement was added to the GO/NO GO CRITERIA as follows:    Phase 1 Step 1   Phase 1  Step 2   Phase 2   Nomenclature A   B   C   Markings (Ref Performance Specification 3.3.2.3.1.1)  All other terms and conditions in the solicitation remain the same.  Offers shall be delivered to:  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Building 2521, Attn:  Don Ellison (Code 1162), 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.  Offers shall not be faxed or e-mailed.

Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $75 Million.  Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.

	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.

At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.

<DESC>The posting amends an earlier synopsis entitled “Community Outreach Tuskegee Syphilis Study” which was posted on April 20, 2004, as a potential sole source action to the Tuskegee Human and  Civil Rights Multicultural Center, Tuskegee, Alabama.   

The following information is being provided to better describe the specific tasks associated with this project in an effort to assist alternative sources in determining whether they possess the qualifications to perform the work.  

Much has been written, reported, and documented about the now infamous study, “The Tuskegee Syphilis Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male,” which was conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service from 1932-1972. The Syphilis Study Website, currently available on-line at www.tuskegeemcc.org, was the THCRMCC’s initial effort at overcoming a lack of public awareness of the program by including archival material from the study.  However, a website alone, without effective outreach and awareness programs, is unlikely to achieve two vital objectives:   to disseminate widely the facts and lessons to be learned from these events and to highlight the ongoing problem of syphilis in current society.  The Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Multicultural Center can meet these objectives by providing target audiences with the capability of using electronic media to view the Center.  This action will stimulate interest in the target audience, facilitate questions and promote interest in visiting the Center.   Where a capability does not exist to view the virtual tour or other material on the Internet, interested parties may request an exportable educational package for use in a formal or informal setting.   Both of these activities will facilitate awareness not only of the original 1932 study, but also of the current hazards of syphilis in our society and in turn, enhance and improve the state of medical research and the health of citizens.   The intent of the current project is to continue efforts of the Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Multicultural Center to preserve the history and lessons of the U.S. Public Health Service’s Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the Negro male (1932 – 1972).  Under this Statement of Work,  CDC will seek to broaden public awareness of the Center and its programs, the syphilis study itself, and the ongoing problem of syphilis  The existing website will be expanded and the associated information system hardware and software updated and maintained as necessary.

<DESC>Amendment to the synopsis for the Honeywell Inc sole source BOA, referenced below, is as follows: Item F-15E Mobile Electronics Test Set, 6625-01-286-8798KV, was inadvertently added to the list as a Honeywell part. Please note that Boeing is the prime for this item and it will be removed from the list below.***
The WR-ALC Support Equipment Commodity Council (WR-ALC/LEP) proposes to enter an agreement with Honeywell Inc to support known sole source requirements identified as a result of the data analysis performed on the identified Federal Stock Classes (FSC) associated with the Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC).  The SECC has been assigned 92 different FSCs that will be supported by various different strategic acquisition strategies.  A Justification and Approval has been approved for this corporate contract IAW FAR 6.302-1.  The class J&A approves the use of a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) which will include procedures supporting decentralized ordering.  WR-ALC/LEP will remain the primary management agency of the BOA.  This proposed action will be written as part of the SECC effort established under the AF Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) initiative.  

The items to be purchased include various categories of components and will have a current Acquisition Method Code (AMC) of 3, 4 or 5 assigned in accordance with the DoD Spare Parts Breakout Program, as outlined in DFARS Appendix E.  Repair items will be identified by the Sole Source Repair Selection Process (SSRSP), which incorporates 50/50 and Source of Repair Assignment Process statutory requirements.  The SSRSP will ensure that only sole source contract repair items are placed on these BOA orders.  Research of repair sources will include evaluation of repair method code screening of DoD vendor breakout, reviews of the D043 Master Item Identification Control System, and reviews of the Execution and Prioritization of Repair Support System (EXPRESS) as appropriate.  The items that will be included in the Honeywell BOA have been identified as sole source in accordance with these established procedures.

A review of potential national stock numbers to be included with this action has revealed that there is no available data to support an action except to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the items currently identified as sole source to Honeywell Inc.  However, procedures have been established for the purpose of screening any items that may be identified as sole source in the future.  Additionally, if in the future data is either purchased or becomes available to the Government, items will be deleted from this requirement and may be offered for competition as appropriate.  

Orders may be issued against the BOA for which appropriate sole source documentation demonstrates that Honeywell Inc. is the OEM for the action contemplated.  The type of orders issued may include spares, repair, engineering services, Logistics Sustainment Modifications/Services, and/or Data.  The BOA will be valid for a total period of nine years.  The basic period of performance will be for three years, and will include two, three-year options.

<DESC>This is amendment 0002 to the combined synopsis/solicitation for the Configuration of a Turn-Key Live Production Switching Station, 375 Comm Squadron, Scott AFB IL.  Reference No. F7352133220200A  applies.  The following vendor questions, with resultant Government answers, are provided:  

Question:  Does the Government need the SDI daughter option card to capture digital betacam VCR sources to the switcher?
Answer:   No.

Question:  Would the Government like a storage subsystem to include:  Approximately 1.5 hours of uncompressed video storage installed into 8-bay rackmount chassis with expandability to add more storage to chassis in the future with rack slides, dual channel controller, 6 foot external cable and terminator.  Or:  A 4-bay with no additional bays with rack slides, dual channel controller, 6 foot external cable and terminator?
Answer:  Approximately 1.5 hours of uncompressed video storage installed into 8-bay rackmount chassis with expandability to add more storage to chassis in the future with rack slides, dual channel controller, 6 foot external cable and terminator.

Question:  Would the Government need a software authoring program like Reel DVD to link audio and video clips to buttons?
Answer:  No.
	
Question:  Does the Government want one spindle of 50 DVD-R inkjet printable media with jewel cases with the DVD burner?
Answer:  No. 

Question:  Would the Government like to record the video toasters live switcher program output to a professional real time DVD video recorder?
Answer:  No.

Question:  Would the Government like a Jog Shuttle Controller to control a VTR or DDR to mix with a live camera feed?
Answer:  No.

Question:  Would the Government like dual 20" LCD displays with ATA shipping cases, as well?
Answer:  No.

In addition to the above questions, two vendor comments were submitted, which are listed below.  The Government's input regarding the comments is also listed.  

Vendor Comment:  The Government is requesting a DVD burner.  I recommend Speed Razor 5.5 broadcast quality MPEG 2 encoding software with Dongle.  This software handles the video toaster's uncompressed files natively.  The encoded elemental image streams are magnificent for delivery on DVDs.
Government Input:  The type of DVD burner used will be determined by the vendor.  

Vendor Comment:  As pertains to the rack mount/shock mount cases, our experience has shown that the best method is to get all of the rackmount equipment in first, then order the specific options to the case that the Government wants, such as inner/outer dimensions, locks, wheels, and lids, which are convertible to table surfaces with latches to case, partitions for cables, tapes, etc.
Government Input:  The cases shall be customized to the equipment.

As a result of these questions, the following amended portions of the combined synopsis/solicitation are provided:
(viii)(Part II):  Part II, Technical, is amended to state:  Part II consists of one (1) copy of how the prospective contractor can provide their technical approach on meeting SOW requirements, i.e., meeting technical support within the parameters established in the SOW.  Part II also consists of a prospective contractor providing technical specifications on any "brand name" items listed in the SOW.  Further, Part II also consists of a prospective contractor providing a schematic or drawing of the storage/transport case as listed in paragraph "a" of the Statement of Work.   
(ix)(Addendum)(A):  The Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, proposals submitted by all offerors against the following revised evaluation factors:  Configuration of a live production switching station; technical literature submitted for all brand name items listed in the SOW; a schematic or drawing of the storage/transport case; and technical support/responses as listed in the SOW.  Initially, offers shall be ranked according to technical capability.
(xv)  Past performance references and the RFQs are due to this office NLT 3:00 CST, Monday, 21 Jun 04.

An amended Statement of Work dated 15 Jun 04 is attached.  

Any vendor questions/comments shall be submitted, in writing, to the 375 CONS/LGCB points of contact no later than 2:00 PM, Thursday, 17 Jun 04.

Anticipated NTP: 10 Oct 04 with a 417 calendar days period of performance.  Proposed Options:  Three.  Offerors are advised that a contract resulting this solicitation is co ntingent upon Congressional approval.

SELECTION CRIT ERIA:  Part I of this acquisition will evaluate offerors considering the following technical factors (weighted equally):  Experience; Past Performance, and Organization and Management.  Part II will evaluate offerors based upon price and considering the fo llowing technical factors (in descending order of importance):  Design Solution & Design Drawings; Betterments and Contractor Proposed Betterments; Proposed Schedule; Proposed Equipment and Material; Commissioning for Entire Building; and Subcontracting Pl an.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) solicited from the  Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA), Procurement and Logistics Directorate with its subordinate Defense Information Technology Contracting Organizations (PL/DITCO).  PL/DITCO is in the process of modernizing the processes and automated tools used to accomplish the PL/DITCO mission under the project name of Enterprise Business Modernization (EBM).  PL/DITCO serves as the procurement arm of DISA and has a world-wide operational presence with offices at DITCO-Scott, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois; DITCO-NCR, Falls Church, Virginia; DITCO-EUR, Sembach Air Base, Germany; DITCO-PAC, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; DITCO-SWA, Bahrain in Southwest Asia; and DITCO-AK, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska.  All DITCO offices except DITCO-NCR are defense working capital funded.  NCR is funded by annual appropriations.  All DITCO offices acquire and account for information technology (IT) supplies and services required by the warfighter, military departments, DISA, and other DoD and Federal agencies.  IT services and equipment procured includes telecommunications services, networks, systems, point-to-point circuits, equipment and facilities, as well as computer technology requirements such as: hardware, software, maintenance, and support services.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2003, the organization processed over 35,000 new contracting actions while administering over 1 million on-going contracting actions and 2.4 million financial transactions.  PL/DITCO had revenues exceeding $2.7 billion.

In order to accomplish this large volume of transactions, PL/DITCO manages, operates, and in many cases, has developed, a group of complex software applications across a wide range of computing environments including mainframe, client/server and web. The current list of systems applications includes 11 mainframe applications, 47 client server applications and seven web applications.  These applications have evolved independently over time and do not adhere to a consistent architecture.   This inconsistency adversely impacts the cost of operations and maintenance, the ability for end-users to track requirements through the entire process, and the ability of the technical staff to accommodate changes in requirements.

The goal of the EBM project is to create a single integrated solution that is accessible worldwide, shares consistent data and processes, and provides accurate and easily retrievable information for all PL/DITCO contracting functions.   The solution will incorporate the mandated Federal/DoD e-Business applications and it will solve the data exchange interoperability gap between these applications.  The objective is an application tool suite that uses “business workflow” and net-centric movement of data between applications in order to eliminate manual data entry thereby increasing data accuracy and integrity of procurement and financial information.  Additionally, this solution will replace legacy applications that are no longer required or mandated by DoD for use across the Department or within specific domains associated with OSD’s Business Management Modernization Program.  The optimal solution will reduce the number of unique applications by 75% or more, thus reducing reconciliation problems between systems and reducing applications and recurring infrastructure operations and maintenance costs.  PL/DITCO plans to operate and maintain the proposed systems solutions by acquiring commercial support as an integrated performance package, utilizing current, internal IT support resources, or a combination of both that focuses on systems readiness, availability, and minimized training, personnel, and infrastructure support requirements.  Any candidate solutions shall include a total life cycle management program that capitalizes on available commercial support and an available service delivery environment that will best meet our requirements given a total life cycle management approach from design to decommissioning.

<RESPDATE>060102
<CONTACT>Donald Ellison, Contracting Officer, 812-854-5774, FAX 812-854-5095
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION: This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program.  A solicitation will be published on or about April or May of 2002 that seeks to award contracts to vendor(s) who can provide Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) development.  The envisioned development will lead to small arms sighting subsystems that are suitable for special operations combat.  The solicitation will seek Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contractual vehicles to provide both developmental an d production items.  These may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), however previous market research indicates that all items of interest will require some degree of modification, miniaturization, hardening, or other Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) to be made suitable for Special Operations Forces (SOF) use.   2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and aiming accessories to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its aiming accessories, current SOPMOD accessories are not effective enough to support optimized SOF use.  Although the currently fielded aiming devices meet previous performance and design specifications, these devices ha ve exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  GENERAL, PERFORMANCE GOALS AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:  MDNS Development sources are sought for the development of new items or the adaptation of NDI/COTS items that provide miniaturized day and night aiming capabilities to SOF operators. MDNS sub-systems, when mounted on small arms, will allow the SOF operator to acquire, identify, and accurately fire on enemy targets in combat.  A secondary mission of these MDNS systems is to provide target observation, illumination, and marking. The developments and improvements required are summarized below based on current aiming devices in the SOF inventory.  The below is neither criticism nor endorsement of items in the SOF inventory; rather these current SOF sub-systems ar e listed as baselines and common reference sub-systems for future measurements of increased performance and effectiveness.   (a) Sub-systems sought:  Detailed requirements will be published in the RCO solicitation.  The following summary improvements to existing fielded systems are desired…Improved/miniaturized versions, or alternative items are sought to replace or supplement the following SOPMOD subsystems, in order of priority:  Group A, Passive Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X SPR Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights, (2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD), (3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS), (4) ACOG Reflex Sight (5) ACOG 4X Sight  A(1) 3.5X-10X and 2.5X-8X Special Purpose Receiver (SPR) Sights: improved day/night aiming capability, miniaturization, better resistance to fogging in rain and high humidity conditions, improved instantane ous sighting capabilities, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, improved stadiametric aiming capability (improved mil-dot/stadia line characteristics at all power settings), size and weight reductions, improved reticle illumination (illumination of entire reticle), reticle magnification to match scope power adjustments (first focal plane reticle), range and bullet drop compensation adjustments visible on the reticle both day and night, spirit level or cant indicator at base of reticle, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and lower power settings suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) operations.  Presently, there are no IDIQ contracts for 3.5X-10X SPR Riflescope Sights.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(2) Clip-On Night Vision Device (CNVD):  The CNVD integr ates standard daylight optics with night vision systems.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed.  The CNVD obviates a nighttime capability shortfall with all standard optical sights, such as the SPR Sight and the AGOG 4x.  The CNVD alleviates risk to operators who must currently remove daylight optics and replace them with night optics at dawn and dusk.  This current scenario, requiring a day sight and a night sight, rather than a day sight combined with a CNVD, exposes operators to enemy detection due to movement involved with changing the sights and leaves operators with unsighted weapons during changeover.  Further, the current methodology cannot guarantee repeatable zero after changing from day to night optics.  Improved performance in fog, dust, extreme darkness, foliage is also desired for the CNVD.  There are presently no IDIQ contracts for CNVD. The SOPMOD Program has  a requirement to establish an IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(3) Miniature Night Vision Sight (MNVS): While CNVD is the primary night vision system sought for future small arms, certain small arms remain more suitably served by dedicated night vision sights.  For these applications, an MNVS or similar alternative is required with ruggedization for use on the following platforms:  M14, M16, M249, M60, Mk11, Mk43, Mk46, 5.56 LMG, 7.62 LMG, .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, M2 .50 Caliber MG, and .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.  A variant is required with increased magnification power capability to include 4X-6X, improved resistance to fogging in rain, high humidity, and extreme temperatures, improved performance in fog, foliage, dust, and extreme low light, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, weight reduction, reduced snag hazard, decrease supportability costs, improved  reliability, improved platform mounting flexibility, improved protection for lenses, reticle upgrades, and instantaneous backup sighting capability.  The current contract for the MNVS will expire in FY 2003. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(4) ACOG Reflex:  improved performance in high humidity and rain, instantaneous backup capability when lens is occluded by rain, mist, or debris, night vision upgrades, improved target acquisition for quicker engagement, miniaturization, reduced snag hazard, and improved performance of aiming dot in all lighting conditions.  The present contract for the ACOG Reflex has expired.  A recent contract has been established for the ECOS-N (Maritime Aim Point), however it also could benefit by improvement or replacement to achieve enhanced performance in rain and high humidity, reduce d snag hazard, incorporation of emergency backup sight, and size and weight reduction.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  A(5) ACOG 4X: improved performance in high humidity and rain, ergonomic improvement for use with backup iron sights, night vision upgrades, improved interoperability with night vision goggles, reticle illumination adjustment, improved eye relief, miniaturization, anti-reflective capability, reduced snag hazard, and simplification of reticle pattern.  The present contract for the ACOG 4X has expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines this 4X capability with a variable, switchable, or stacked sight that allows improved sighting both at close and long range.  Group B, Activ e Miniature Day/Night Sight Subsystems: (1) Visible Bright Light (VBL), (2) Integrated Pointer/Illuminator Module (IPIM), (3) AN/PEQ-2 Infrared Laser Pointer/Illuminator (ITPIAL), (4) AN/PEQ-5 Carbine Visible Laser (CVL) B(1)  VBL: Ruggedization, weight and size reduction, reduced snag hazard, improved reliability when used in automatic fire, and a variety that provides for combination of Infra-red and white light capability into one module. Existing contracts for the VLI will expire in FY 2002. The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(2) IPIM: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance/reflectivity of visible lasers against green and black targets, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the IPIM have expired.  T he SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.   B(3) ITPIAL: Increased range capability, improved power consumption, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, pattern and pulse capabilities, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the ITPIAL have expired.  The SOPMOD Program has a requirement to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight.  B(4) CVL:  Increased range capability, improved power consumption, improved performance with green and black targets, improved compatibility with laser eye protection, weight and size reduction, improved performance in rain and high humidity, and ruggedization.  All contracts for the CVL have expired. The SOPMOD Program desires to establish a new IDIQ contract for this variety of sight, or to obtain a similar contract for a subsystem that combines th is capability into a unified system, such as IPIM above. (b) Performance and Research Objectives Common to All Sub-systems:  The SOPMOD program is not seeking alternate sources for the currently fielded SOPMOD equipment named above, rather is seeking alternative sub-systems with the following improved operational performance characteristics as research objectives: (1) increased User Acceptance to include: improved operational suitability, improved performance in semi-automatic and full automatic fire, increased range, snag free in movement through vegetation and battlefield obstacles.  Increased hit scores by SOF operators during day, night, rain, mist, smoke, vegetation, fog, dust, and extreme low light conditions (2) miniaturization, including reductions in both size and weight, with an objective of increased weapon portability and better weapon balance during the act of fir ing (3) increased reliability, durability, corrosion resistance, ease of cleaning, (4) fully functional for a minimum of 15,000 rounds threshold, 30,000 rounds objective, (5) functional reliability exceeding that of the present subsystems at high and low temperature extremes as well as other hostile (sand/dust/dirt/mud/surf/temperature shock) environmental conditions (6) recoil shock endurance sufficient to allow use on all SOF small arms (7) improved safety, (8) low optical augmentation retro-reflection, (9) improved lens performance in rain, fog, snow, dust, and other atmospheric conditions, e.g. transparent sacrificial lens covers, (10) decreased life-cycle support costs.  5.  ACQUISITION PLAN: Source Selection will be conducted in accordance with the Kaminski contracting method.  Items will be selected on a “Best Value” Contracting basis.  IDIQ contracts will be awarded t o offerors in accordance with the following plan:   (A) RCO Solicitation is to be published on or about April or May 2002.  The RCO solicitation will provide the government requirements in detail.  Please do not respond to this advisory announcement until such time as the RCO solicitation is published.    (B) Solicitation is planned to close on or about May or June 2002.  Upon the closure date and time, the offeror must deliver 5 written copies and 1 electronic copy of the Offeror’s Technical Proposal.  The Technical Proposal will include, as an enclosure, a copy of the MS PowerPoint Briefing to be presented by the offeror during follow-on Oral Presentations.  A Source Selection Panel will evaluate the technical proposals, screening them to establish the competitive range.  A Source Selection Board (SSB) will be convened.  The SSB will consist of an Operational Evaluation Tea m (OET), a Technical Evaluation Team (TET), and a Contracting and Management Evaluation Team (CMET).  A Test and Evaluation Review Panel (TERP) Chairman will be appointed from the membership of the SSB.   The TERP Chairman will be overall responsible for the joining and compilation of adjectival voting scores and for source selection documentation at all stages of source selection.  Also, an SSB Chairman will be assigned by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to chair the SSB.  Screening criteria, in order of importance are (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Technical Evaluation, and (3) Contracting and Management Evaluation.  The most important adjectival voting results will be those developed by the OET.  The second most important are the results of the TET.  However, the TET may disqualify a technical proposal if it violates physical laws, engineering principles, contains tech nical features that would prohibit it from meeting the specification, or if it contains technical errors indicating that the offeror is technically incompetent or is proposing a technical approach that is unacceptably risky.   The CMET will provide the third most important results.  However, the CMET may disqualify a vendor for statutory or past performance reasons, or for unreasonable prices.  Vendors who propose more rapid delivery schedules, and can prove that they can meet those schedules, will receive preference for award in the voting of the Contracting and Management Evaluation Team.  This project seeks to field equipment in a time frame that is relevant to current conflicts.  Delivery of first articles is August 2002 (Objective), and March 2003 (Threshold).  Offerors of proposals found to be in the competitive range will be invited to renovate their proposals based on S SB findings, and to proceed to the next stage of competition, which will be Oral Presentation/Demonstration.   (C) Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, followed by awards will be conducted on or about June or July 2002, at a location to be announced.  The SSB will hear oral presentations made by the offerors in the competitive range and clarify the offerors’ technical proposals through questioning.  The SSB may opt to require demonstrations, to include live-fire demonstration and evaluation, during this stage of competition.  Upon completion of Oral Presentations/Demonstrations, the SSB will conduct a second adjectival vote.  The TERP Chairman will provide the SSB Chairman with the documentary source selection recommendation(s).  The SSB Chairman, in conjunction with the Source Selection Authority, will make the final decision for award.  In order to avoid unreasonable governmen t test costs and lengthy schedules and to maintain efficiency of competition within schedules that are meaningful to current conflicts, the SSA will strive to award only one contract per sub-system variety, but may award more than one contract if a compelling reason is found.   (D) Follow-on Developmental and Operational Testing will be conducted on a schedule to be determined by the contact negotiation and award process.   6.  RECITALS: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202- ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS.  The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this announcement. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government.  The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.  The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or SOPMOD subsystem  drawings.   7.

<DESC>The use of full-body fall-protection harnesses has been a critical work practice control for reducing the number of falls-from-elevation-related severe injuries and fatalities.  To improve the efficacy of these devices, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research (DSR), has proposed a series of studies on full-body harness sizing and design parameters.  Bounding Box (BB) method is one of the few techniques that have been developed to quantify human torso shape and size for potential harness design application.  NIOSH proposes to use the BB method to extract shape information from the Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource (CAESAR) data, based on the Bounding Box equations and sizing scheme developed in a recent NIOSH study.  The goal is to define the optimal adjustment range of each harness component for both vest type and over-the-head type harnesses.

The contract includes three phases.  Phase 1 is to develop a sampling strategy for mining the CAESAR data; a sample in the proximity of 500 out of the 2340 CAESAR subjects is suggested.  Phase 2 is to measure/calculate bounding box dimensions from torso data for the selected subjects.  The best-fit harness size for each selected subject will be calculated.  Phase 3 will classify the selected CAESAR subjects into different harness size groups, and use a weighted statistical approach to determine the optimal adjustment range of each harness component for each harness-size category.

A full set of the CAESAR database will be available to the awardee for the task and shall be returned to NIOSH once the project is completed.  The contractor is to report, in layman language, (1) the sampling strategy and its rationale for the strategy for mining the CAESAR data, (2) the data distribution of the selected CAESAR subjects by predicted-harness-size categories, and (3) the tabulated harness adjustment range for each harness component.  A technical report should be prepared which should include the results from the above-mentioned steps.  The report should be organized to include an executive summary, an introduction, a methods-and-procedures section, a data-analysis-and-results section, and a summary-and-conclusions section. Raw data and processed data are to be enclosed in electronic forms. They should be retrievable with common multimedia, graphical, or statistical packages.  Reports are to be provided to the Project Officer in both hard copy (1 copy) and electronic formats (in Word file formats).  The period of performance for this contract shall not exceed 4 months from the date of contract award.  

NIOSH reserves the right to publish the analysis results first.  Subsequent publications and presentations by the contractor are subject to NIOSH review prior to release.  

This project is currently supported by a justification for other than full and open competition to Total Contact, Inc., 45 North Main Street, Germantown, Ohio 45327-1349.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist.  Through this announcement, organizations are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate to the Government their qualifications and capabilities to provide the stated services.  

To be considered qualified, interested parties must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing familiarity with the Bounding Box prediction equation and in delivering the kinds of activities outlined above. 

Responses shall contain no more than 3 pages total.  Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements above and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit written information to Rebecca Mullenax, MS -1019, Reference 000HCCB7-2004-10397, DHHS.PHS/CDC, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or responses may be submitted electronically to Rebecca Mullenax at rmullenax@cdc.gov.

Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, a solicitation will be issued under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which will be reviewed by the Agency.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources and provides additional information to that previously provided in the Sources Sought Notice posted March 22, 2004.  The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is performing a market survey to determine if there is an adequate number of interested and qualified firms, having the capability to fund the capital development costs for the design and construction in the vicinity of Tijuana, Mexico of a 59 MGD (million gallons per day) secondary wastewater treatment plant with supporting facilities, to include a pumping/conveyance system for the conveyance of 25 MGD of advanced primary effluent from the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant in San Ysidro, California to the secondary treatment plant in Mexico and from the treatment plant in Mexico to the South Bay Ocean Outfall in the United States.  The project will be carried out consistent with Public Law 106-457 (22 U.S.C. Section 277d-43 et seq.) and International Boundary and Water Commission Minute No. 311.  The firm selected will be responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations of the United States, State of California and Government of Mexico regarding water quality, including compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.).    

We are seeking interested firms that have the ability to provide up-front financing for this project.   The firm selected will be responsible for the design, construction and operations of the treatment plant and will use competitive procedures applicable in Mexico for the procurement of property or services for engineering, construction, and operation and maintenance of the Mexican facility.  The final design of the facilities to be constructed in Mexico will be subject to the approval of the U.S. and Mexican Governments. Design and construction of the project is expected to take 18 months to 2 years.  The USIBWC anticipates entering into an operating lease contract under which it will make payments, subject to the availability of U.S. Congressional annual appropriations, for the engineering, construction, and for a period of 20 years the operation and maintenance of the Mexican facility, in an amount up to $156 million or such amount as the Congress may subsequently authorize.  No payments will be made until after construction has been completed, operations have been initiated, and funds have been appropriated and are available to the USIBWC for this purpose.  Payments will also be contingent upon verification by the IBWC that the effluent treated at the Mexican facility complies with the water quality laws of the United States, the State of California and Mexico.    The USIBWC will seek funding for this project through the U.S. Federal Budget Process and will be diligent in working with all relevant Federal Government parties on an annual basis.  Upon termination of the contract, the facilities constructed in Mexico will be transferred in adequate operating condition to the responsible Mexican authorities.

All interested firms should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by July 2, 2004.   Responses shall include:
 
§	Identification and verification of the firm's capabilities to provide up-front financing to cover the costs for design, construction and related costs for the proposed project.  
§	Annual financial reports for the last five years.
§	Past experience with projects that are similar in size, scope and complexity to the proposed project, both in the United States and Mexico.
§	Letter from a financial institution confirming the firm's capability of obtaining up-front financing to cover the design, construction and related costs associated with the proposed project.
§	Description of ability to develop the project envisioned in Public Law 106-457 and International Boundary and Water Commission Minute No. 311.
§	Capability to obtain and comply with any construction, operations and discharge permits in the United States, the State of California and Mexico as it relates to the project.

This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  All businesses capable of providing these services are invited to respond.  Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>Small Business Sources Sought:  The Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch, Center for Population Research, and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is planning to recompete its current contract for the synthesis and testing of nonsteroidal and nonhormonal male contraceptive agents which prevent the formation of spermatozoa in the testis, prevent the maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis, and alter the integrity of stored spermatozoa.  Such compounds should be devoid of (or have minimal) ancillary endocrine, central nervous system, cardiovascular and/or other side effects. The reversibility of infertility after drug treatment is desirable.  Safe drugs that result in sterility will be considered.  Offerors must have medicinal and/or synthetic organic chemists on staff to carry out the proposed synthetic chemical and testing program.  The Federal Government is prepared to test such compounds in several standard assays if the contractor is unable to perform such testing.  Specifically excluded from this project are GnRH analogs, gossypol derivatives, steroids, cytotoxic agents including triptolide, tripdiolide and tripchlorolide, and all alkylating agents including expoxy compounds, fluoroacetamide, chloro- and bromohydrin, deoxyhalosugars, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimines, and sulfonoxylalkanes including ethylene glycol disulfonate.  Also excluded are nucleosides, nucleotides, nonspecific antimetabolites, antimitotic agents such as colchicine, N-substituted diamines (i.e., WIN. 13,099), most major classes of antibiotics including the macrolides, penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones and tetracyclines, sulfasalzazine, cotrimoxazole, and ketoconazole.  Nitroheterocyclic compounds are also excluded.  Proposals to merely collect compounds from various sources and/or only perform biological assays will not be considered. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The required service is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  For the purpose of this synopsis, a small business is defined as one that employs no more than 500 persons.  Small businesses that believe they have the ability to satisfy the stated requirement, and meet the above size standards, are encouraged to submit a capability statement within 30 days of the publication of this synopsis.  Your capability statement should be limited to twenty-five pages or less and include: a description of extensive experience in designing, synthesizing and testing nonsteroidal and nonhormonal male contraceptive agents. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  If responses indicate the likelihood of satisfactory competition among qualified small businesses, the anticipated solicitation will be restricted to small businesses only.  Interested organizations should submit a letter of interest and capability statement, via e-mail, fax, or mail, within 30 days of the date of this publication, to: Robert Stallings, Contract Specialist, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510; e-mail-nichdcmb@mail.nih.gov.

The SHEM (Safety, Health, and Environmental Management) Training for Overseas Posts (STOP) program focuses on eliminating safety, health, and environmental hazards that pose a threat to foreign service officers, their dependents, and the FSN staff at overseas posts.  A portion of the routine safety and health training required by federal standards is provided to staff during the visit.  The on-site training conducted with post personnel during STOP visits is a critical and necessary means of reducing the likelihood of U. S. government personnel suffering disabling injury or death.  

The purchase is a continuation of a project aimed at obtaining digital videos on CD-ROM that have been translated into target languages. The supplier selected must be able to supply the selected training programs in Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, German, and Simplified Chinese (used in Mainland China). The translated videos will be copied onto CD-ROM disks, one training program per disk.  Initially ten copies of each CD-ROM (video) in each language will be obtained.  These videos will enable SHEM personnel to conduct more effective training in the local languages of locally employed staff as well as permit posts to do further safety and health training to comply with federal training requirements.  

At this time we are interested in obtaining videos addressing the following topics:

&#61623; Forklift Fundamentals - This video must address pre-use inspection of the forklift, the physics associated with operating a forklift, and basic safe operating procedures.
&#61623; Electrical Safety - This video must provide a basic explanation of electricity and the hazards of working with it.
&#61623; Electrical Safety - This video must discuss methods and techniques for avoiding the hazards of electricity.
&#61623; Hand Safety - This video must discuss the various types of hazards presented in the work place, the devastating effects of hand injuries, and methods for avoiding injury
&#61623; Lockout/Tagout - This video must explain the purpose of lockout/tagout, demonstrate the performance of a procedure, and illustrate the consequences of not following proper procedures.
&#61623; Welding Safety - This video must explain safe work practices for all types of welding and cutting and discuss the consequences of not following these procedures.
 
&#61623; Ergonomics - This video must focus on office ergonomics and proper lifting in office and warehouse settings.
&#61623; Respiratory Protection - This video must address proper respirator selection, use, and maintenance.
&#61623; Chemical Safety - This video must address hazard information, proper chemical storage practices and incompatibilities, proper use, and product substitution.
&#61623; Warehouse Safety - This video must address proper storage practices, working at elevation, and proper lifting.

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of NbN Hot Electron Mixer Devices
<DESC>The Terahertz Technology Project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Electromagnetics Division submitted a proposal entitled "Development of Low-Noise NbN Hot Electron Bolometer (HEB) THz Receiver Technology for Temperatures above 10 K" in response to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Announcement (NRA) 00-0SS-01 of the Space Astrophysic Research and Analysis program.  The proposal outlines a plan of research on the performance of extremely thin films of Niobium Nitride (NbN) hot electron bolometer (HEB), as heterodyne detector elements in ultra-low noise, terahertz-frequency spectrometers.  Such spectrometers are used in many NASA missions t obtain data on the chemical composition and physical properties of the Earth's atmosphere, the atmospheres of other planets, and interstellar nebulae.  The proposal was a joint effort between NIST, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Colorado at Boulder.  NASA funded the proposal through a transfer of funds to NIST after a competitive peer review.  During the 12 months of the development, the principal investigator, Dr. Gerecht, shall continue to develop the apparatus for measurements of noise temperature for NbN HEB mixers for focal plane arrays.***This publication is a notice of the dispersement of funds from NIST to the University of Massachusetts via a purchase order

<SUBJECT>36 -- Requesting proposals for completing TVA's Regenesys Plant in Columbus, Mississippi
<CONTACT>Steve Jones, Manager, RSO&E, Phone 865/632-6086, Fax 865/632-4798, Email dsjones2@tva.gov - Steve Jones, Manager, RSO&E, Phone 865/632-6086, Fax 865/632-4798, Email dsjones2@tva.gov
<DESC>TVA is soliciting proposals for completing its Regenesys Plant located in Columbus, Mississippi. TVA began the Regenesys project in 1999. Construction of the facility began in 2000 on approximately 3 acres. The facility is approximately 85% complete. The facility is currently designed for a redox flow battery based on sodium and bromine chemistry, which was intended to supply 12 MW for 10 hours nominally to Columbus Air Force Base (CAFB) in order to reduce line loading into the base during peak hours, provide near UPS backup support for critical systems at the base, and to provide VAR support to the TVA grid.  The plant was designed to be versatile so that a number of energy storage modes could be explored and their value to TVA evaluated.

TVA desires to dispose of the facility in a manner that would represent the best overall value to TVA. This could include multiple options, including, but not limited to, revenue from a sale, lease or license, revenue from future power generation, as well as other energy technologies that may be adaptable to the site. 

To express your interest in receiving a copy of the RFP, please contact Steve Jones at dsjones2@tva.gov.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

The US Department of the Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage this procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency.  OBJECTIVE:  Sugarcane appraisals are to be performed whenever any acreage of the insured crop will not be harvested (e.g., if the insured wishes to put the crop to other use), or production to count cannot be determined using actual records of harvested production.  Appraisals may also be required for growing season inspections or pre-harvest inspections. This procurement is being issued to develop a new appraisal method to replace the Inadequate Stand Method and Stand Reduction Method that can be used to determine insurability of stubble cane acreage and determine potential yield of immature sugarcane. The Government anticipates that this will be a Firm Fixed Price award for 24 of the specified work requirements, and Time and Materials for the other two, and reserves the right to award without discussions.  The independent Government cost estimate for this project is based on approximately 1800 professional labor hours of effort.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to Affymetrix, Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is a requirement of the Cereal Disease Lab (CDL), MWA, ARS, USDA at St. Paul, MN for an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing the genome of Fusarium graminearum and the purchase of 360 chips. Gene set will be provided to Affymetrix by CDL. This chip will be unique and specific to CDL. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305). The custom GeneChip will be made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix. A 11 um feature size with 23,000 features per chip is requested. The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000. The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each predicted gene, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNo.5527681). Additional control sequences (plant and bacterial) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis. The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNo. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The Fusarium custom GeneChip probe array will be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. CDL will process the chips at the core lab at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Affymetrix without further notice. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

All quotations shall include price(s), FOB Destination, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, delivery and  installation schedule, and payment terms. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.

A:  It is estimated that one third of agency networks do not use the USDA network as an internet Service Provider (ISP).  These networks are generally connected to local university campuses.  A standard MOU template may be created and used to meet this requirement.

(13)	Q:  Please clarify what is required for task 3.4.  The first sentence states the contractor will review documents to determine if risk is acceptable. Does the government have an acceptability criterion that should be used?

A:   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications related to Security and Certification and Accreditation shall be followed.

(14)	Q:  The second sentence (Task 3.4) states that vulnerabilities should be documented in a POA&M. Does this mean the contractor should document vulnerabilities identified in Security Plans, self-assessments and ST&Es in a POA&M or something else?

A:  The contractor shall document vulnerabilities identified in system security plans, self-assessments, and ST&E’s.

(15)	Q:  The third section (Task 3.4) describes tools and methods that can be used to determine if vulnerabilities exist. Are these tools that were used to help develop the Security Plans, self-assessments and ST&Es or tools the contractor should use to determine if vulnerabilities exist?

A:  These are tools the contractor may use to determine if vulnerabilities exist.

(16)	Q:  Have any Risk Assessments (NIST SP 800-30 or other format) been conducted for any of these systems and applications?

A:  An initial risk assessment to determine security categorization and system boundaries has been performed and will not be required by this contract.

(17)	Q:  Who will schedule interviews with ARS system personnel, if necessary? How soon after task initiation will documentation be made available to the contractor?

A:  Interviews with agency system administrators will be coordinated between the contractor and Agency IT Security Specialist.  System documentation will be provided within 5 business days following task initiation.

(18)	Q:  Does ARS currently have a Configuration Control Board, (CCB)?

A:  No.

(19)	Q:  Has a DAA been appointed?

A:  Yes, DAA’s have been identified for all systems.

(20)	Q:  Does the C&A include the enterprise network, workstations (PC's), mail servers, file servers, and print servers?

A:  Yes the C&A includes all agency networks and applications.  At present, agency sites manage networks locally.

(21)	Q: How many servers are used to support the 213 systems?

A:  Varies depending on the location.

(22)	Q:  Which phases of the C&A process are required by this RFQ?

A:  All phases as prescribed in NIST SP 800-37 shall be followed.

(23)	Q:  Are any of the self-assessments completed on any of the systems?

A:  Approximately, 70 self-assessments will be completed by July 1, 2004. 

(24)	Q:  How many of the 213 systems are "low impact" systems per the definitions of the USDA C&A procedures referenced in the synopsis?

A:  All systems have been evaluated by ARS senior management and have been categorized as low impact in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199.

(25)	Q: 2.0 Scope says, "The contractor shall develop detailed instructions, to
** assist ** ARS system administrators to create documentation and complete tasks that meets USDA's requirements for certification and accreditation." (Emphasis added) Please confirm or clarify that the deliverable of "complete tasks" is dependent on USDA personnel participation in a timely and professional manner. How many such personnel are available, for how many hours over what period of time?

A:  Agency resources will be available to complete tasks as needed between June and September 2004 during normal business hours.

(26)	Q: Scope 3.3. Confirm that the contractor shall review all 213
self-assessments. Or - for low-impact systems, the methods & procedures need only be described by the contractor; the actual review will be carried out by other personnel. In which case the review is NOT a deliverable, rather a document describing the methods and procedures IS the deliverable for low-impact systems.    

A:  The contractor shall conduct the self-assessments and is responsible for reviewing the security plans and self-assessments.

(27)	Q:  Scope 3.4. If a system is low-impact, is the self-review SUFFICIENT to
meet the needs of the Test requirement in this paragraph? If not, how many vulnerability scans might be needed to satisfy the OCIO and other
requirements?

A:  NIST SP 800-37 guidance related to Security and Certification and Accreditation of “low impact” systems shall be followed.

(28)	Q: Scope 3.5. Confirm that only the standard "Interconnectivity" document
needs to be developed and that USDA will cause the negotiations with the
ISP's to happen at some later date. 

A:  Yes, a standard template document shall be developed.  Formal negotiations regarding the “interconnectivity agreements” will be performed at a future date.  This task shall be reflected in the agencies POA&M and is not included in the scope of this contract.

(29)	Q:  Under section 8.0 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE, all the work is asked to be done in Beltsville or at the contractor's site. Are all 213 systems located locally or the contractor has access to the packages locally? Are we simply assisting to verify the contents and the quality of the packages for all these systems? 

A:  The contractor will be provided access to all existing system documentation.  The contractor is responsible for completing the documentation outlined in the SOW.

(30)	Q:  Is all of the documentation such as self-assessments, etc, available for all of the systems?

A:  No.  System security plans exist but have not been updated this year.  No other documentation currently exists.

(31)	Q:  Paragraph 3.4 Security Test and Evaluations – Has the ST&E been conducted on all the systems by another vendor?  If so, the assumption is that the vendor on this contract will be reviewing the results of that ST&E.  Is this correct?

A:  No ST&E has been performed.  The contractor shall review ST&E results when they are completed.

(32)	Q:  Paragraph 3.3 Perform Initial Risk Assessment – Have initial risk assessments other than self-assessments been performed as required by the C&A guidance?  If not, is the intent of this section that the vendor performs a risk assessment of each system?

A:  Initial risk assessments have been completed.  Self-assessments have not been performed.  Contractor shall conduct the self-assessments and analyze the results in security evaluation reports that document vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

(33)	Q: Second Paragraph of Section 2.0 states that, "ARS currently has 100 research locations including a few in other countries.     The contractor shall provide security consultation and technical support to ARS to complete C&A activities for all of its Major/Non-Major Applications and General Support Systems, consisting of local area networks and web farms geographically located across the United States at ARS Area Offices and field locations."  However, Section 8, states that "All work shall be performed at the George Washington Carver Center (GWCC) located in Beltsville, Maryland, or the contractor's facility."  Is it possible for all ST&E activities to be performed from the GWCC location for all MAs and GSSs under this SOW, including any manual configuration testing and interviewing of key technical individuals? 

A:  Yes, the ST&E for agency systems can be conducted from the GWCC location.  Since the systems are low impact, the Agency will be conducting self-assessments, and performing vulnerability scans to meet ST&E requirements.

<DESC>Questions and Answers

1.  I was also wondering as to what detail the sample site goes.  Is it possible to sign in and take a look and can you tell me if that information is indicative of what is wanted for the new site?

	The sample site only shows the home page, but is the fun, youthful look we are seeking
 
2.  Can you tell me what the back end database was built on and if that is what is wanted for the new site?
	
I do not know about the database.  We just need to ensure that the information and children's information are secure and safe.

3. Is the requested development of the four mascots in order to select one or is to actually use four mascots for different campaigns? 

We would like to go in the following direction... 
    Our goals are to:  
        Get the kids moving
        Increase fitness programs
        Increase youth programs membership
    Four "Fit 4 Fun" areas to focus on are:
       1.  Physical Fitness
       2. Education/Mental Health/Nutrition
       3. Social Benefits
       4.  Safety

We are looking for a team of 4 characters that are the "Fit Force????" (like the Power Ranger??).  Maybe each of the 4 "Fit 4 Fun" program areas are represented by a member of the "Force"

 
4. Can you provide a list of the target markets (ie parents, children, teens, pre-teen, etc..?

Just as the first paragraph of the SOW states: "The web site and fitness program plan should be appropriate to the interest, skills, and abilities of youth 9 to 18 years of age".
