I. Scope of Work
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting market research across industry to identify existing product solutions and/or services to:
Perform VistA Data Dictionary Analysis & Remediation.
Conduct VistA M code analysis / convergence.
Identify and report VistA M code security vulnerabilities.
VistA is the integrated administrative, financial, business, and clinical system supporting VA s operations.  
Current Environment
There are 130 VistA systems in production across the U.S. supporting over 1,200 Veterans Health Administration hospitals and clinics.  Each VistA instance is composed of over 2,700 files, 64,000 data fields, 1,300 print templates, 9,100 options structured across 1,700 menus, 3,300 remote procedure calls, 38,000 routines, and 4.7 million lines of code. Each system has some local variation of all of these artifacts.  The current environment is further described at a multi-tier architecture layer level.
Presentation Layer
VistA s current presentation layer is the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). CPRS is deployed as a thick client-server based system. CPRS is supplemented by the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) web application, which is a joint DOD/VA developed system operated independently by each agency to display the longitudinal health record for all active duty and Veterans Service members. The VE Program is also developing a new, thin client (web-based) and mobile end-user graphical user interface (GUI) to VistA to expand its ubiquitous access via various types of end user devices.  Initially, the web-based GUI, the electronic Health Management Platform (eHMP), will introduce new clinical capabilities then begin to incorporate and enhance CPRS functionalities.  At present, it is anticipated that a complete migration from CPRS to eHMP cannot fully occur until 2020 or later.  To make a full transition from CPRS to eHMP, or any potential future COTS software integration, the VA needs a standardized VistA system with a cleaner separation of its architecture layers and interfacing of VistA to new thin clients and external systems with all business logic preserved, which will accelerate the transition.  
Application Layer
VistA is a fully integrated system comprising 181 clinical, financial, and administrative applications integrated within a single database, such that there is only one single authoritative version of any data that all applications use.  The VistA database is the Congressionally-mandated single source of truth for Veteran information, and is required to be accessible and usable for the lifetime of the Veteran.    The clinical component of VistA (analogous to an Electronic Health Record (EHR)) represents only 50% of VistA s functionality.  
VistA is based on MUMPS (the Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System, abbreviated as  M ), the industry-standard database technology in healthcare.  All Federal healthcare systems are based on M (Indian Health Service (IHS), Defense Health Agency (DHA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA)); in the private sector more than 50% of all U.S. hospitals are based on M.  The virtue of M is that all the data and code are tightly integrated in a single environment, making highly reliable, highly performant, tightly integrated transactional systems.  However, this tight integration of code and data can also create challenges if not properly managed.  
VistA began over thirty years ago as the Decentralized Hospital Care Program (DHCP) and was developed in the field by clinician-programmer teams at VA Medical Centers (VAMCs).  Because DHCP was designed at the outset to provide data and code portability independent of the hardware or operating system environment, DHCP has successfully evolved and migrated from many different hardware platforms and operating system platforms over the past thirty years.  However, despite the consolidation of these applications to a national standard ( Class I application ), there remains much locally-developed code at each VAMC ( Class III applications ).  Many of these field-developed products are extensions or enhancements to existing VistA applications. VA has a process to evaluate and migrate selected Class III applications that provide enhanced functionality and that offer value to VA by addressing the enterprise-wide business goals of its health care operations.  However, there are other Class III applications that remain custom to a VAMC location and are not designated for evaluation to transition to nationally-distributed (Class I) status.  All of these Class III applications must be evaluated for use within the VistA consolidated national version.  This process is currently manual and not sustainable.  Therefore,  a fully automated means of continuously monitoring all VistA systems for code and configuration changes relative to a national standard is required, and thus allow for field innovations, while at the same time providing a continuous, automated process of reconciliation going forward.
Data Layer
VistA is MUMPS, an integrated application-database environment.  Any discussion about VistA must thus clearly distinguish whether one is managing MUMPS code or MUMPS data. The architecture of VistA separates application code from application data using the Database Application Programming Interface (Fileman API), which allows applications to read and write their data to MUMPS global storage in defined, structured form through a Data Dictionary. However many applications do not use the Fileman API to write data to the database, and instead write directly to the MUMPS storage, leaving the definitions in the Data Dictionary inaccurate (and thus leaving the data inaccessible).  VA requires an automated method to identify the locations in the system where this occurs and to remediate the data dictionaries and FileMan API such that all data within the system is fully defined and accessible through the Fileman API. 
Business Rule/Logic Layer 
VistA s business logic is spread across many layers and technologies   in the application M code, in the thick client code, in remote procedure call (RPC) logic, and other locations. VA desires to isolate and consolidate this business logic and expose it to external business platforms to provide additional business logic and functionality to VistA.  However, much of VA s business logic is specific to VA and cannot be represented or operationalized by any external business platform.  VA thus requires a tool to assist in analyzing, segmenting and isolating VistA s business logic that is currently spread throughout all layers of the VistA environment.
Infrastructure Layer
VA has consolidated hosting of its 130 instances of VistA at six (6) regional data centers (RDCs), two (2) of which are hosted at Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs).  In addition, it has established read-only, mirrored instances at each local VA Medical Center (VAMC).  VA anticipates continuing the consolidation effort to transition to a single, FISMA HIGH IaaS, vendor-provided cloud solution with disaster recovery (DR) and continuity of operations (COOP).  VA s goal in this infrastructure consolidation is to reduce the cost of operation, maintenance, and technology refresh while retaining/improving the performance of VistA.  
Security Layer
Interoperability and exchange of VistA data with DoD and Community partners requires the highest level of security on the data exchanged.  Therefore, VistA s security stack must be enhanced to accommodate these requirements.  Current VistA security is dependent on Kernel access control and authentication, which is further wrapped by layers of Application logic of RPC logic.  The VA Office of Information Security (OIS) has traditionally been focused on external network and  enterprise boundary  security, rather than VistA security per se   which include such as vulnerabilities of the VistA Kernel (authentication and access control) or RPC Broker (remote access security).  
The desired  to be  state will include (1) better authentication (FROM the kernel-managed local VistA process TO an enterprise-based authentication approach across all VistA systems that links to the identity and access management (IAM) system and other services), (2) better access control (FROM over 9000 menu options of Kernel) TO a patient-centric and/or data-centric approach, and (3) better auditing (TO apply better utilization of FileMan s audit functions to enforce auditing on all transactions).
External or remote applications integrated to VistA (aka  extended VistA ) allow remote access to VistA yet commonly fail to implement established VistA security criteria such as screen time-outs, password refresh, prohibition of generic user accounts, etc.  These aspects of the design must be audited to enforce  application level  security and compliance of the external applications and middleware that interface to VistA.  In addition, many RPC Broker calls have vulnerabilities which threaten the security of information in the VistA database.  These RPC Broker vulnerabilities must be remediated in order to have secure, yet remotely accessible VistA data.
VistA provides user log-on auditing (logging) and the Sensitive Patient Access Log (SPAL), however the volume of data in the Kernel log-on log and the incomplete nature of the SPAL makes human review of these activity logs challenging to detect intrusion in a timely fashion.  This indicates a need for real-time, industry standard vulnerability and intrusion detection monitoring utilities for VistA that improves upon today s Kernel-based security approach.
II. Technical Background
VA requires a commercial off the shelf (COTS) tool or tools to assist in: 1. Performing VistA Data Dictionary Analysis & Remediation, 2. Conducting VistA M code analysis / convergence, and 3. Identifying and reporting VistA M code security vulnerabilities.  This/these tool(s) is/are necessary to progress VA s VistA Standardization and Virtualization (VSV) and VistA Security Remediation (VSR) projects.  Industry feedback is requested to assist VA to identify COTS tooling to achieve the desired objectives as indicated by the referenced requirements.
III. Technical Challenges
The VSV and VSR projects are top priorities for VA, whose outcomes may influence the ongoing use of VistA as VA s EHR platform.  COTS tools are required to facilitate the analysis and remediation of variances across VAMC VistA instances.
This is not a RFI to solicit Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) alternatives to VistA.  VA is exploring COTS EHR alternatives but anticipates that for any such alternative and transition to be successful, the VSV and VSR efforts must be executed to have a standard VistA baseline from which to integrate and later migrate. It remains a requirement whether a COTS EHR alternative is selected or not.  
IV. RFI Response
Your response must include the following:
Provide a completed spreadsheet indicating whether your product fully meets, partially meets, or does not meet some or all of the stated VistA MUMPS tool requirements relative to (I) Data Dictionary Analysis & Remediation, (II) Code Analysis / Convergence, and (III) Security described below.  Please use the spreadsheet included in this RFI release for capture of your product s alignment to the stated requirements.  No other method for this mapping will be accepted.
