(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-- (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract-financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (e) Contractor EFT arrangements. If the Contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the Contractor has not notified the Government of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the Government shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database. (f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-- (i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-- (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. (g) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. (j) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government.

<DESC>The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions, add technical information, add a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause and extend the due date for quotes.***(1) The following responses are provided to  technical questions submitted: QUESTION: What is the storage capacity of the storage tubes at NIST?  ANSWER:  Each tube has a volume of 62.125 cubic feet. NIST normally calls for a delivery of helium when the fifth tube is placed on service. The sixth tube is normally kept in reserve as an emergency supply because NIST cannot afford to run out of helium. A delivery is normally is around 38,000 cubic feet, but we have received, in the past, a delivery of over 40,000 cubic feet.  We start around 200 pounds and bump up the pressure to around 2200 pounds. Maximum pressure is 2300 pounds at which point the safety relief will activate.***QUESTION: How many trailer loads are estimated for the one-year period?  ANSWER:  NIST estimates approximately 7 to 8 deliveries over the next year. The reactor schedule has a lot to do with this. If the reactor is shutdown for an extended period our helium usage increases and additional deliveries may be required. The schedule, as it stands now, minimizes shutdowns so 7 to 8 deliveries should be all NIST requires.***(2) The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause is hereby added to the Request for Quotation:  FAR 52.208-8 Required Sources for Helium and Helium Usage Data. (APR 2002).  (3) The following 
is hereby added to the Request for Quotation:  In order to be considered for award, in accordance with FAR 8.501, offerors must be "a private helium vendor that has an in-kind crude helium sales contract with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and that is on the BLM Amarillo Field Office's Authorized List of Federal Helium Suppliers available via the Internet at http://www.nm.blm.gov/www/amfo/amfo_home.html"
(4)  The due date for quote is hereby changed to read as follows:  FROM:  Monday, September 30, 2002 at 5:00 PM EST, TO: Friday, October 4, 2002 at 5:00 PM EST.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged by reason of this amendment.
