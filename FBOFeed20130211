<CONTACT>David S Dombeck, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882635, Email ddombeck@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/ISD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Mailstop A19, Atlanta, GA, 30333, on February 7, 2013, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., 4560 Horton Street, Emeryville, California 94608-2916 to store and rotate pediatric vaccines in a national pediatric stockplie for use in the event of a disease outbreak or vaccine shortage. <br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the manufacturer, Novartis is the only vendor with a market large enough to rotate older stockpiled vaccines into operating inventory before expiration and replace them in order to maintain a viable stockpile. Contracting with the manufacturer, Novartis, to store and rotate these stockpiled vaccines is the only alternative to keep CDC's purchased vaccines viable for use year after year, and maintain the stockpile in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Recent market research on manufacturer specific vaccines revealed multiple distributors capable of storing stockpile vaccines but none capable of rotating the vaccines. Without the capability for an organization to rotate the vaccines into the market and then replace those rotated vaccines with fresh vaccines, it could not most efficiently and effectively manage CDC's pediatric vaccine stockpile program. Novartis is the only company which has exclusive capabilities to store and rotate their own vaccines without the Government having to make additional purchases.<br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to David Dombeck, Contracting Specialist, Reference 2013-54404, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Maria Shamburger, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341, or via email at vwj8@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.<br /><br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Novartis, as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<p>This is an unrestricted acquisition. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for a Hawk, Environmental Monitor - Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) Microdosimeter. NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Far West Technology, Inc (FWT). FWT is the original equipment manufacturer and is the only supplier. The Hawk TEPC has been successfully calibrated and is currently operating on the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. This calibration process is the same model that will be used for the RaD-X mission. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required equipment, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 02/13/2013.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<CONTACT>Eric Bubar, Phone 3019753635, Email eric.bubar@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory, intends to negotiate with Stanford Research Systems Inc.; Sunnyvale, CA, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 3304(a)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to purchase a lock-in amplifier.
<p>The lock-in amplifier from Stanford Research Systems will be used to demodulate a laser beam transmitted through a Fabry-Perot cavity. By demodulating the laser beam, the lock-in amplifier will provide a locking signal with a zero-crossing at the resonant frequency of the cavity. In conjunction with the appropriate feedback electronics, the lock-in amplifier will allow NIST to lock a laser to the cavity resonance. Locking to cavity resonances is the centerpiece of the NIST IMS optical pressure standard. The lock-in amplifier must interface with existing equipment that is currently in use at NIST, the cost of which was 10X greater than this lock-in amplifier. Market research indicates that Stanford Research Systems Inc. is the only company that can provide a lock-in amplifier that meets the specifications and can interface with the existing equipment at NIST.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334515- Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals with a Size Standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Stanford Research Systems Inc. for this requirement. The equipment will be used at the NIST-Gaithersburg location. The award is anticipated to be completed by March 31, 2013.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Eric Bubar at eric.bubar@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than February 26, 2013 at 5:00 pm.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
MINA SALMAN QUAY WALL REPAIR PROJECT
RM 12-2691, RM 12-2774)

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Europe Africa Southwest Asia (NAVFAC EURAFSWA) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a design-build (D-B), firm fixed-price, contract for quay wall repair project (RM 12-2691, RM 12-2774) at Mina Salman, Bahrain.

The anticipated requirement will be issued under Solicitation N33191-13-R-0820.

The anticipated solicitation will be structured with the following base and option Contract Line Items Numbers (CLINs):

CLIN 0001  BASE: QUAY WALL AREA A REPAIR: All labor, management, supervision, tools, materials, site work and provisions for the design and construction of the repair of the Area A quay wall to meet current and future vessel berthing demands, live load requirements of UFC 4-152-01, mooring/berthing loads of UFC 4-159-03, and lateral wind/earthquake loads of UFC 3-301-01 to provide safe and adequate ship berthing to support the US Navys 5th Fleet.
  Complete in accordance with the conceptual drawings and specifications in the design-build RFP and not including any other work included on other CLINs.

CLIN 0002  OPTION: QUAY WALL AREA B REPAIR:  All labor, management, supervision, tools, materials, site work and provisions for the design and construction of the repair of the Area B quay wall to meet current and future vessel berthing demands, live load requirements of UFC 415201, mooring/berthing loads of UFC 415903, and lateral wind/earthquake loads of UFC 330101 to provide safe and adequate ship berthing to support the US Navys 5th Fleet.  Complete in accordance with the conceptual drawings and specifications in the design-build RFP and not including any other work included on other CLINs.

The quay wall is approximately 4,000 feet long (2,000 LF along Area A & 2,000 LF along Area B), built in 1977 and consists of a concrete cap, asphalt pavement, mooring system, underwater steel sheetpile bulkhead, and attached fendering system.
 The bulkhead structure consists of composite steel PSP Ishaped bearing piles and PZsection sheetpiles.  The current design dredge depth is 34 feet MLLW. 

Currently the U.S. Navy only leases Area A (base bid), which is approximately 2,000 feet long and consists of Berths 15 and 16. The negotiation of a lease for Area B (approximately 2,000 feet long and berths 11, 12, and 14  Option #1) is in progress with the intent to provide additional berthing space and facility development area to support future U.S. Navy operational requirements in Bahrain. Currently the lease of Area B has not been approved by GOP and the Bahraini Government. 

Recent studies have concluded that the existing quay wall is in fair overall condition and no serious structural deficiencies of the steel sheetpile bulkhead were found during a swim by underwater inspection.
 However, significant deterioration was found throughout the concrete cap. Therefore it has been recommended that the asphalt pavement, concrete cap, fendering, mooring, and seaside cathodic protection system be replaced. 

A conceptual design of the repair of the entire quay wall is underway and will be included in the six part D-B RFP currently being prepared by NAVFAC EURAFSWA.  Geotechnical, underwater, and cathodic protection field investigations have recently taken place and these reports will also be included in the D-B RFP.   

This requirement will be solicited using competitive negotiation procedures under FAR Part 15 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990.

In accordance with FAR 236.204(ii), the estimated price range for this Mina Salman Quay Wall Repair Project, including the option, is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

The Government intends to award one (1) firm fixed-price design-build contract.
  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in selection of the Best Value offeror, price and other factors considered. 

In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

The solicitation is expected to be posted to EuroNECO on or about February 27, 2013.  Proposals will be expected to be due by March 29, 2013 Central European Time (CET).  All dates are tentative and are subject to change.

The Government intends to post all notices/amendments related to this solicitation on the European Navy Electronic Commerce Online (EuroNECO) website at https://euro.neco.navy.mil.
 All documents published in EuroNECO will be transmitted to the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) at https://www.neco.navy.mil and Federal Business Opportunities at www.fbo.gov.  All interested firms must be registered on the EuroNECO, NECO, or FBO web sites in order to obtain the solicitation documents and all information regarding the solicitation. 

Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. It is the responsibility of the offeror to check the website daily for any updates/amendments. Prospective offerors will have access to the solicitation at the EuroNECO/NECO/FBO web sites by searching for solicitation number N3319113R0820 (no hyphens). Offerors are encouraged to check the EuroNECO/NECO/FBO web sites frequently in order to be notified of any changes to this solicitation.
 If you register for this solicitation, you will receive a courtesy e-mail notifying you of all amendments for this solicitation that are posted on the website. Registration for this solicitation, however, does not release the offeror from the responsibility of checking the solicitation daily for amendments.

All offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov to be considered for award of any United States of America Department of Defense contract. In order to register in SAM, proposers must have a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number from http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform and a Commercial and Governmental Entity (CAGE) Code (U.S. firms) or a NATO Commercial and Governmental Entity (NCAGE) code (non-U.S.

<CONTACT>Aaron Hamm, Phone 202-776-0200, Fax 202-776-0080, Email ahamm@usac.org
<DESC><strong>
<p>Base Notice: USAC Request for Information:</p>
<p>SharePoint Upgrade Migration Tool - USAC-IT-2013-2-08</p>
</strong>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) is requesting information from software publishers, NAICS code 511210, capable of providing the services set forth herein inclusive of small businesses, including disadvantaged, woman-owned, HUB-zone, veteran-owned, and service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, (collectively, "small businesses").</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) appointed USAC the administrator of the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the universal service support mechanisms - High Cost (HC Program); Low Income (LI Program); Rural Health Care (RHC Program), including its pilot program; and Schools and Libraries (SL Program), also referred to as E-rate, as set forth in Title 47, Part 54, Section 701 of the Code of Federal Regulations. USAC administers, subject to FCC regulations, directives and oversight, the USF and the Programs. This request for information (RFI) pertains to a future requirement for a tool that will enable USAC to migrate from SharePoint 2007 (WSS 3.0) to SharePoint 2010/2013.</p>
<p>USAC may conduct a competitive procurement to contract with a software publishing vendor that will recommend/implement a solution that will allow USAC to migrate from SharePoint 2007 (WSS 3.0) to SharePoint 2010/2013. USAC desires a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based solution that requires little to no customizations that USAC will maintain and operate after deployment. USAC contemplates awarding a single firm-fixed-price contract for one year with options of up to two and three-year durations. USAC will use also the information received in response to this RFI to determine the potential for small business participation in the competition for this contract.</p>
<p>USAC is not a federal agency, a government corporation, a government controlled corporation or other establishment in the Executive Branch of the United States Government. USAC is not a contractor to the Federal Government. The contract awarded as a result of the RFP will not be a subcontract under a Federal prime contract. However, USAC conducts its procurements in accordance with the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding with the FCC, which requires USAC, as a general matter, to apply designated provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), including requirements for full and open competition.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF SERVICES</p>
<p>The migration tool solution should include, but is not limited to the following primary functions:</p>
<p>1) Migrate individual sub-sites, lists, libraries one at a time, as they are ready to be migrated.</p>
<p>2) Migrate components as frequently as necessary until the migration is error-free to our satisfaction.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>3) Synchronize migrated components with the original server until we are ready for end users to use the newer version.</p>
<p>4) Migrate the contents of custom applications (including those built by the web team as well as the "Fab 40" application templates distributed by Microsoft but NOT supported in 2010 / 2013) while leaving out the incompatible parts, allowing us to recreate the functionality if we desire without losing the content</p>
<p>5) Migrate workflows created by SharePoint Designer along with the lists with which they are associated</p>
<p>6) Rename components during migration</p>
<p>7) Split large sites into multiple smaller sites, or combine small sites into single sites, or even split our single farm into multiple farms if desired</p>
<p>8) Have some sites live on the new server, and some sites live on the old server</p>
<p>9) The product (either included in the tool or related) will allow us to move content, sites, webparts, workflows, and other components from Development to Test to Production.</p>
<p>10) The product should also moving content between libraries, lists, and sites, without changing the "last modified date" or "modified by" fields. Changes and moves can be scheduled.</p>

<DESC><strong>Repair Sources Sought, FA8251-08-D-APG-68 Power Supplies Repair</strong>
<p><strong>NOTICE</strong>: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 811219 which has a corresponding Size standard of $19M. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE<br /></strong>The Air Force is issuing this repair sources sought announcement as part of a market research survey to determine if additional sources exist that could become qualified for repair of the F-16 PSP Power Supply Assembly SRU, NSN 6130-01-473-8223, P/N 750-1, and its components.<br /><br />Description: The Power Supply Assembly is a large 3kW supply that powers the PSP used in the AN/APG-68 radar system. The main output is 5V/400 Amps with several auxiliary outputs. <br /><br />Requirement: This is for an estimated 23 repairs per year for 5 years of the PSP Power Supply Assembly.<br /><br />The government does not own any repair manuals or detailed parts lists for the Power Supply Assembly. Additionally, the government does not possess any special test equipment available for repair of the Power Supply Assembly.

<DESC>1. Purpose: The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Spacelift Range and Network Systems Division (SMC/RN) is seeking to determine the ability of small businesses to perform systems engineering and integration (SE&amp;I) services under the contemplated Unified SE&amp;I Contract (USC). SMC/RN is deeply committed to providing opportunities for small businesses. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Given the unique and complex nature of the SMC/RN requirements, potential small business offerors interested in performing as the prime contractor may wish to consider subcontracting with other companies possessing relevant experience with the Spacelift Ranges at Cape Canaveral AFB, Vandenberg AFB, and the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). Please be aware of any teaming arrangements that cause organizational conflicts of interests (OCI) issues, which may cause potential offerors to be eliminated from potential contracts with SMC/RN.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC MIDLANT) is seeking eligible Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUB Zone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform the proposed contracts. 
The Government anticipates a contract award for this project in August 2013. The appropriate NAICS Code is 236220 with a size standard of $33,500,000.

NAVFAC MIDLANT anticipates awarding a Design Bid Build (DBB) Construction project for Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) 423 at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
  The BEQ 423 was constructed in 1971 and is a three story, three-wing,  62,205 square foot building.  It has been determined that the deteriorated and underperforming HVAC system combined with windows that leak moisture and air are the root causes of the mold growth in BEQ 423. 

General Work Requirements:  

The replacement windows will be ATFP code compliant with blast-resistant glazing. Other work includes upgrading fire protection to code, upgrading first floor bathrooms to comply with architectural access (ADA) code, mold remediation, carpet and paint in the bedrooms and corridors, renovating first floor lounges, renovate kitchens, upgrading to R-19 insulation inside the walls, upgrading electrical transformer, upgrading fire hydrants, repairing sidewalk, replacing dryer exhaust line in NAS Oceana Building 423.
  Replacement of HVAC system will include drilling geothermal wells in an open grass area field, demolition of existing mechanical system as well as related civil, architectural, and electrical repairs associated with the mechanical system.  Replace the main HVAC system with an energy efficient ground source heat pump and install the Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to monitor and control the geothermal HVAC system. All the windows will be renewed to remediate the moisture leakage. Walls will be demolished in order to repair windows, providing the most opportune time to upgrade wall insulation to R-19.  Sidewalks may need to be demolished and repaired to accommodate the installation of geothermal wells in adjacent grass field.
   The D-Wing is primarily a mechanical space that has a separate male and female bathroom. The current bathrooms will be renovated to meet ADA access requirements. This will meet the ADA requirement to have a first floor handicap accessible bathroom.  The kitchenette renovations will include replacement of flooring and rearrangement of the kitchen to accommodate an electric range. This includes the kitchenette in the three berthing wings (A, B, and C). In order to accommodate the electric ranges, each will be retrofitted with exhaust ventilation. Renovation of the kitchenette lounges will require storage of existing furnishings. 

All bedrooms, corridors, and stairwells will be painted and repaired.
 All defective doors will be replaced. The first floor lounges and second floor kitchens will be renovated in Wings A, B, and C of BEQ 423. Upgrading exhaust vent to support laundry dryers are additional quality of life improvements.

<DESC>CAC2S Request for Information (RFI)
<p>TOPIC: CAC2S Voice Network Solutions</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) briefly describes the current Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) program/acquisition approach, identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule, and requests information to assess industry's capability to provide a materiel solution that will meet portions of the current CAC2S voice network requirements.</p>
<p>The information provided in this RFI is notional and may change. The Government is under no obligation to revise any aspect of this RFI should any information provided herein change. The Government will provide any additional information and issue any additional requests for information at its sole discretion via the Fedbizopps website only.</p>
<p>Description:<br />The CAC2S program is exploring potential hardware and software solutions to replace the aging voice network system to minimize increasing obsolescence issues. CAC2S is employing an evolutionary acquisition strategy utilizing an incremental (two increments) and phased (two phases defined within increment one) approach for development and fielding of the CAC2S. Limited Deployment Capability (LDC) was achieved 2nd Qtr FY12 with the fielding of the first Phase 1 CAC2S. Phase 1 is structured to accommodate rapid fielding of operationally relevant capabilities to include mobility, situational awareness, tactical communications, information dissemination and operational flexibility that will establish the baseline CAC2S capabilities for the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) and improve overall Air Command and Control (AC2) performance and effectiveness. Phase 2 completion will result in the delivery of the full CAC2S Increment I capabilities where Full Deployment is currently planned to commence in 3rd Qtr FY16.</p>
<p>Currently, CAC2S voice communications take place over the voice and radio Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) of a dedicated IP network that is logically and physically isolated from the CAC2S data network (and from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET)). The CAC2S voice network is a scalable, configurable Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications system that can support a wide range of communications needs. Specifically, it must provide integrated intercom, radio, audio conferencing, and (optionally) plain old telephone service (POTS) communications to all users through a single user interface. The system must provide both VoIP soft-switch and radio interface capabilities. The voice network must also support remote monitoring and control of attached radio systems. Finally, the voice network must consist of workstations which provide user interfaces for joining or monitoring radio nets, controlling AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, and AN/PRC-150 military radios, and initiating or answering intra-CAC2S intercom or conference calls. Refer to Annex A for a depiction of the current CAC2S configuration. The first sheet of Annex A is a physical architectural representation of the AN/MRQ-13 Communication System (CS) vehicle utilized in CAC2S. It basically consists of two 48 port Cisco 3560 network switches, 2 Digital Switching Units (DSU), Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM), and multiple Radio Terminals. The DSU's, along with DSAN/LongArm software, provide the push to talk (PTT) and RS 232 remote radio control capabilities. The second sheet of ANNEX A represents a basic CAC2S Operation Facility (OPFAC) architecture. Each table consists of a Universal Serial Bus Audio Adapter (UAA). The UAA provides the network interface for the Voice Terminal Workstations (Panasonic Toughbooks), Foot Switches, PTTs, and headsets. The tent switches are 48 port Cisco 3560Gs.</p>
<p>Requested Information:<br />Respondents are requested to provide information on the following capability statements:</p>
<p>1) Describe the number of operational users that can be supported at any given time.</p>
<p>2) Describe the number of operational radios that can be supported at any given time.</p>
<p>3) Describe covered and uncovered radio configurations.</p>
<p>4) Describe the approach taken regarding an Internal Communication System (ICS), along with the high level capabilities it will provide.</p>
<p>5) Describe the ability to provide secure and non-secure use of standard military telephone capabilities.</p>
<p>6) Describe the ability to monitor an ICS conversation while actively talking on a radio.</p>
<p>7) Describe the ability to monitor various radio nets while still actively talking on another net.</p>
<p>8) Describe how PTT and remote radio control is provided for military radios. Also provide a list of military radios in which the system supports these functions.</p>
<p>9) Describe the modularity and scalability of the system.</p>
<p>10) List the recommended hardware and software for the voice network solution. Along with the recommended hardware solution, provide the minimum hardware requirements.</p>
<p>11) Describe the system requirements necessary to maintain operation under high load (RAM, CPU, etc).</p>
<p>12) Describe the ability to perform given a large number of intercom or radio net participants. Indicate whether the system is capable of handling 206+ users and up to 48 radio nets. Identify known performance limitations based on existing test data.</p>
<p>13) Identify the recommended operating system(s) for the voice network solution.</p>
<p>14) Describe any known Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages issues with the voice network solution.</p>
<p>15) Describe system component Technology Readiness Levels and where the system is currently in use.</p>
<p>16) Describe all licensing requirements, if any, associated with the voice network solution.</p>
<p>17) Describe any Information Assurance (IA) accreditation that has been completed on the voice network solution.</p>
<p>18) Describe the ability to monitor a classified net while talking on an unclassified net.</p>
<p>19) Describe how your system impacts the current CAC2S network architecture (i.e. can it utilize current switches and existing Panasonic Toughbook workstations).</p>
<p>20) Describe the Open Architecture Assessment of the voice network solution.</p>
<p>Responses:<br />This RFI is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or otherwise obligate the Government to issue any solicitation for proposals. Pursuant to FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Holloman AFB's local construction projects are funded by Sustainment, Restoration &amp; Modernization (SR&amp;M) funds and generally have a magnitude between $500K and $6M. In the past, construction projects have been procured individually using a combination of competitive procedures, decentralized ordering authority on other agencies' IDIQ contract vehicles, and sole source procedures.</p>
<p>PROPOSED ACQUISITION STRATEGY:</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding ID/IQ contracts to a small group (between 3 and 5) of contractors who demonstrate the capability to perform construction projects as described in the draft solicitation sections L and M provided with this announcement.</p>
<p>The Government has not finalized the small business strategy for the Holloman MACC, but a 100% set-aside for Small Business is contemplated.</p>
<p>The Government intends to compete subsequent task orders (TO) using fair opportunity procedures in accordance with FAR 16.505. TOs awarded may use any of the following contract types: Firm Fixed Price (FFP).</p>
<p>The proposed period of performance (PoP) for the ID/IQ contracts is a twelve (12) month base year and four (4) twelve (12) month option years.</p>
<p>PREVIOUS MARKET RESEARCH:</p>
<p>A sources sought synopsis was posted on Dec 01, 2010, solicitation # F2E3CR1201MACC.</p>
<p>CURRENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>
<p>This announcement includes a draft solicitation (section L and M only) and a survey which industry may use to provide feedback to the Government. Responses for each question within the survey are limited. The Government requests that each company, business unit or business entity, submit only one consolidated response rather than separate responses from individual persons who wish to provide feedback. Submissions of the surveys are required no later than Friday, 28 Feb 2013. Please submit your survey via email to Ms. Theresa Sandoval at: theresa.sandoval@holloman.af.mil.</p>
<p>All surveys and/or documentation submitted shall become the property of the Government. The Government reserves the right to utilize and share with industry any information suggested, unless information is identified with proprietary or business sensitive markings.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the FAR, (b) Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement, makes no commitments or obligations in issuing it, may choose to cancel it, ignore any proposal resulting from it or totally revise it. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:</p>
<p>The Government respectfully requests offerors to limit correspondence at this time to answering the survey. Statements of Capabilities or other marketing information or visits are not desired.</p>

<a href="mailto:angelic.hatcher@us.army.mil">MICC - Fort Hood</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Operational Test Command, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to TREX Enterprises to develop new capabilities in the existing Geometric Automated Video Location System (GAVELS), produce GAVELS hardware and software for the ABNSOTD, and to provide GAVELS sustainment support for all GAVELS systems at ABSOTD and FIRES Test Directorate (FTD). This contract will develop the capability for the existing GAVELS-NVC to track paratroopers.  Upon completion of the development, the upgraded system consisting of eight Data Collection Systems, one Data Reduction System, a Remote Control System and all system software will be delivered to ABNSOTD.   Period of performance for the IDIQ contract is 36 months from date of award.  The system development and production Task Order period of performance will be 12 months after the date of the Task Order award.  Period of performance for the sustainment will be 36 months after the date of the Task Order award via one or more Task Orders.  Total estimated cost for this effort is approximately $2,789,490 for the upgrade development and production, and $299,940 for three (3) years of sustainment of all GAVELS fielded systems.  The minimum expenditure on the contract is estimated to be $2,789,490 and the maximum $3,089,430.  The current GAVELS systems were awarded competitively to TREX under contract W9115U-11-C-0003 and the government requires enhanced systems capabilities to meet mission essential needs.   FTD and ABNSOTD at times share GAVELS assets.  For this reason, it is imperative that the FTD and ABNSOTD systems be compatible.  To accomplish both the required upgrades and the sustainment a vendor would require access to the GAVELS system tracking software code.  This software and its code is proprietary to TREX.  The government does not have licensing or other data rights.  Without this code a vendor cannot accomplish the work required to design, test and install upgrades and perform sustainment work on the GAVEL systems to ensure uniformity of performance and operation.  The NAICS code is 334220 with a size standard of 750. The proposed contract action is for end items for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will only consider the capability submissions received within fifteen days after date of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used only for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this synopsis.  All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to the Government point of contact for this announcement angelic.m.hatcher.civ@mail.mil.  The Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses.

<CONTACT>Betty B Vannoy, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2891, Fax 770-488-2868, Email bbv9@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc., Atlanta, GA 30312, for the professional services for the participation in the project entitled, "King Youth Empowerment and Health Promotion and Wellness Fest Forum."
<p>CDC intends to negotiate this requirement under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(i). The sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13 procedures. The anticipated period of performance will be six months from the award date. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 813410 with a small business size standard of $7 million. The purpose of this contract is to procure the services and technical expertise from the only qualified contractor who will&nbsp;develop and implement a series of coordinated activities focused on the promotion of public health in support of the King Youth Empowerment and Health Promotion and Wellness Fest Initiative as part of the activities for King Week 2013. The Health and Wellness Fest will be held on January 12, 2013, to coincide with the month of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birth, and will take place in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>The King Center is the only responsible source capable of providing the King Youth Empowerment and Health Promotion and Wellness Fest. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a civil rights leader, recognized proponent of non-violence, and community outreach leader. The King Center was founded to carry on Dr. King's legacy and share his teachings. The King Center holds the intellectual property rights to proprietary "Kingian" youth non-violence training. Since the Health Fest will focus on the teachings and personal philosophy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., this proprietary training is essential. No other organization can tie the philosophy of non-violence as exemplified by the life of Dr. King, to the issues of Teen Dating Violence, Bullying, Youth Violence, and Gang Initiation Rituals as effectively as the King Center.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. King's Civil Rights' legacy gives the King Center unparalleled influence in the Atlanta community, the site of the Health and Wellness Fest forum. Dr. King's Civil Rights' work provides the King Center with particularly strong ties to Atlanta's minority community, many of whom stand to benefit from the Health and Wellness Fest Forum. The King's Center's unparalleled influence in the Atlanta Area will allow the message of the Health and Wellness Fest to have a greater impact on the community than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to The King Center. However, firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by January 8, 2013, at 1 PM EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Betty Vannoy by email at bbv9@cdc.gov and reference Solicitation No. BBVFY130002. No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1892<br />Name:		Rubber Bands, Latex Free, Orange, Size 19<br />Description:	Latex free non-toxic nitrile rubber band, orange. Size #19, 3-1/2"(L) x 1/16"(W) x 1/32"(Gauge). UOI is BG. BG = 1 LB.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1893<br />Name:		Rubber Bands, Latex Free, Orange, Size 33<br />Description:	Latex free non-toxic nitrile rubber band, orange. Size #33, 3-1/2"(L) x 1/8"(W) x 1/32"(Gauge). UOI is BG. BG = 1 LB.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1894<br />Name:		Rubber Bands, Latex Free, Orange, Size 64<br />Description:	Latex free non-toxic nitrile rubber band, orange. Size #64, 3-1/2"(L) x 1/4" (W) x 1/32" (Gauge). UOI is BG. BG = 1 LB.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1895<br />Name:		Rubber Bands, Latex Free, Orange, Size 117B<br />Description:	Latex free non-toxic nitrile rubber band, orange. Size #117B, 7"(L) x 1/8"(W) x 1/16"(Gauge). UOI is BG. BG = 1 LB.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1896<br />Name:		Rubber Bands, Latex Free, Orange, Assorted Sizes<br />Description:	Latex free non-toxic nitrile rubber band, orange. Assorted sizes. UOI is BG. BG = 1 LB.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1892<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ALL37196; ALL42199</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1893<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ALL37336; ALL42339</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1894<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ALL37646; ALL42649</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1895<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ALL37176; ALL42179</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-1896<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	ALL37546; ALL42549</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 26, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<SUBJECT>Proposers' Day Announcement for the IARPA Cryogenic Computing Complexity (C3) Program
<SOLNBR>IARPA-BAA-13-05(pd)
<RESPDATE>030513
<ARCHDATE>03112014
<CONTACT>Dr. Marc Manheimer, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-13-05@iarpa.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Cryogenic Computing Complexity (C3) Program on March 12, 2013 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM EST in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The conference will provide information on the C3 Program, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.<br />This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.
<p><br />PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:<br />Power and cooling for large-scale computing systems are rapidly becoming unmanageable problems for the enterprises which depend on them. The trend towards large, centralized computing facilities to house supercomputers, data centers, and special purpose computers continues to grow, driven by cloud computing, support of mobile devices, Internet traffic volume, and computation-intensive applications. In 2012, the total power demand of the TOP500 supercomputers measured around 0.25 GW; the total power usage of the, roughly, 500,000 data centers worldwide was estimated to be 31 GW in 2011. Conventional computing systems, which are based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) switching devices and normal metal interconnects, appear to have no path to be able to increase energy efficiency fast enough to keep up with increasing demands for computation.</p>
<p>Superconducting computing could offer an attractive low-power alternative to CMOS with many potential advantages. Josephson junctions, the superconducting switching devices, switch quickly (~1 ps), dissipate little energy per switch (&lt; 10-19 J), and communicate information via small current pulses that propagate over superconducting transmission lines nearly without loss. While, in the past, significant technical obstacles prevented serious exploration of superconducting computing, recent innovations have created foundations for a major breakthrough. For example, the new single flux quantum (SFQ) logic circuits have no static power dissipation, and new energy efficient cryogenic memory ideas allow operation of memory and logic within the cold environment. Studies indicate that superconducting supercomputers may be capable of 1 PFLOP/s for about 25 kW and 100 PFLOP/s for about 200 kW, including the cryogenic cooler. Proof at smaller scales is an essential first step before any attempt to build a supercomputer.</p>
<p>Superconducting computing research currently consists of a few, scattered efforts with no initiative focused on advancing the field overall. Major research challenges include insufficient memory, insufficient integration density, and no realization of complete computing systems. The C3 Program will address these challenges with the goal of establishing superconducting computing as a long-term solution to the power- cooling problem and a successor to end-of-roadmap CMOS for high performance computing. Success of C3 will pave the way to a new generation of superconducting computers that are far more energy efficient than end-of-roadmap CMOS and scalable to practical application.</p>
<p>IARPA expects that the C3 program will be a five-year, two-phase program. Phase one, which encompasses the first three years, serves primarily to develop the technologies that are required to demonstrate a small superconducting processor. Phase two, for the final two years, will integrate those new technologies into a small-scale working model of a superconducting computer.<br /><br />C3 Program thrusts will include:<br />1. <strong>Cryogenic memory</strong>: New approaches to enable high performance computing systems with greatly improved memory capacity and energy efficiency.<br />2. <strong>Logic, communications and systems</strong>: Development of advanced superconducting circuits and integration with memory and other components for demonstration of a limited superconducting computer system on which to measure performance metrics.</p>
<p>IARPA expects that each proposal will address fully a single thrust. If a proposer wishes to propose against more than one thrust, then separate proposals should be submitted. Proposals are not desired that address only a small portion of a thrust's goals. Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. Participation is open to individuals and organizations from around the world so long as the prime contractor is a US organization.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00 PM EST March 5, 2013 at http://events.SignUp4.com/C3_PDRegistration. Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than two representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a Visit Request Form for Foreign Nationals no later than 5:00 PM EST March 5, 2013. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p>ATTENDEE PRESENTATIONS<br />Attendees who wish to present organizational capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to dni-iarpa-baa-13-05@iarpa.gov. Presentations will be limited to 10 minutes and a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). The opportunity to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a first-to-ask basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00 PM EST) March 5, 2013. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization. The IARPA Point of Contact will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt">SOLE-SOURCE PROCUREMENT for Phase II of TIGER Grant Administration and Grantee Performance Tracking Application<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), Office of the Secretary, Office of Infrastructure Finance and Innovation (OST-P-40) plans to acquire contract support from Deloitte in order to complete Phase II of an ongoing process and systems/application development project supporting the <span style="COLOR: black; mso-ansi-language: EN">Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (</span>TIGER) program.</p>
<p>TIGER provided a unique opportunity for the U.S. Department of Transportation to invest in road, rail, transit and port projects that promise to achieve critical national objectives<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Starting in 2009, Congress dedicated $1.5 billion for TIGER I,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>$600 million for TIGER II (2010), $550 million for TIGER III (2011), and $500 million for TIGER IV (2012) to fund projects that have a significant impact on the Nation, a region or a metropolitan area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first round of TIGER was pursuant to the <span style="COLOR: black; mso-ansi-language: EN">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, abbreviated <strong><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">ARRA</span></strong> (Pub. L. 111-5), commonly referred to as the Stimulus or The Recovery Act, and provided for capital grants for transportation infrastructure development, focusing on job creation aspects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The second round of TIGER included both capital and planning grants, and the third and fourth rounds of TIGER provided for capital grants. </span></p>
<p>Applications were evaluated through a competitive process by technical and professional experts at DOT, and project benefits were analyzed to ensure that limited funds were spent most effectively. The TIGER programs use rigorous, multi-modal selection criteria and the results of economic analysis to select projects and track the effectiveness of TIGER investments through focused project-specific performance measurement plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the several rounds of TIGER, P-40 has received more than 7,500 applications and awarded 218 grants, for a total of $3.1 billion. Deloitte has provided management and systems support as a partner with U.S. DOT on the TIGER project from the inception of the program, contributing to its success by supporting strategic planning, pre-application and application receipt and processing, and grantee award and post-award data management processes for all four rounds of the TIGER Discretionary Grant Program.</p>
<p>Deloitte has unique and unsurpassed knowledge of this project, having provided program management and technical support to the TIGER Program for all existing TIGER rounds and completed development of Phase I of a new comprehensive data management application. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>For Phase I, Deloitte designed, built, and begun the implementation of a number of custom developed applications to serve as a permanent and universal repository for all TIGER Grant application and evaluation data. Deloitte has assisted with the developments of the metrics and the process for obtaining the data allowing for their measurement and evaluation as the program emphasis has moved from job creation to long term sustainability and community development,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>P-40 recognizes that a single source to Deloitte is rational, prudent, and warranted given that (1.) Phase II was only excluded from modification 0002 to call #2011-Z-008 because of the expiration of BPA No. DTOS59-06-A-00050 in 2012, (2.) Deloitte was the approved vendor to complete the full delivery originally scheduled to conclude on June 30, 2013, and (3.) a delay in funding of the planned work for Phase II would add time/materials/labor costs to the delivery schedule.</p>
<p>In Phase II, Deloitte will finalize all custom development and data migration from other sites within the DOT operating environment, will complete OST dashboard development-thereby allowing consolidation, gathering, and analysis of application and grantee data, while providing the required implementation and end user education and support P-40 requires from a multimodal tracking application. Such support is required by a program that achieves this enhanced information sharing and reporting in order to facilitate shorter response times for inquiry and encourage robust data collection and management from applicants, grant administrators, and grantees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Maintaining a relationship with Deloitte is the most efficient and cost-effective way to complete ongoing development and implementation, averting any retraining and duplication of effort required by bringing in new contractors in mid-development/implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, given the known timeframes for (a) issuing new network and security credentials, (b) being properly debriefed and gaining an understanding of system/application requirements, and (c) required delivery by June 30, 2013 OST feels that completing the scope with the current contractor is warranted and necessary.</p>

This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>52.24-403-70 Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.<br />1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:<br />a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.<br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.</p>

<p>52.242-1502 Evaluation of Contractor Performance Utilizing CPARS (APR 2011) <br />The services, although not directly supervised, shall be reviewed by Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff to ensure contract compliance. The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 42.15. Contract monitoring reports will be prepared by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and maintained in the contract file. <br />In accordance with FAR 42.1502 and 42.1503, agencies shall prepare an evaluation of contractor performance and submit it to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The BOP utilizes the Department of Defense (DOD) web-based Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to provide contractor performance evaluations.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is OPM2613Q0098 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)2005-64 dated January 18, 2013.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses, allowing only a small business to submit proposals.</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Center for Leadership Development (CLD) provides high quality leadership and management development for supervisors, managers and executives across the Federal government through both multi-agency and single-agency designed courses. OPM has established two leadership institutes, the Federal Executive Institute in Charlottesville (FEI), Virginia, and the Management Development Center's (MDC's) with locations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and Aurora, Colorado. OPM also offers courses at the OPM Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and at other locations. <br /><br />As a Federal business enterprise, CLD provides services that assist Federal agencies in achieving their missions by providing competency-based leadership programs to build great leaders for great government.</p>
<p>One course offered by CLD is the Effective Writing in the Federal Government: Leading with the Written Word (EFW). The current EFW course design utilizes a standard classroom format with in-person instruction. The EFW includes a series of modules that cover subject matter presentations and exercises that correspond with relevant OPM competencies. The EFW is not to be considered a basic writing course. It is designed to prompt and teach participants how the Federal government announces, defends, investigates, regulates, explains issues and systems, and procures products and services that run the country and impact the American people. The course also explores how Federal employees compose, review, edit, and issue critical and sensitive written materials for diverse audiences including national and international groups. For those who write for regulatory, investigative, and oversight agencies, to name a few, the need for effective writing is critical to the success of their organizations. The need to rid documents of cluttered or unclear language has been made a priority by government executives.</p>
<p>In support of its mission, OPM needs to acquire no more than (5) contractors to provide Instructor services for up to (10) modules titled, "General Philosophy for Improving Writing Skills; Exploring Outlines; and Written Communication via E-mail," during the delivery of the Effective Writing in the Federal Government: Leading with the Written Word (EFW) courses.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award no more than (5) Firm-fixed Price purchase orders to the offeror(s) that represents the best value to the government. The offeror shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract, see Statement of Objectives (SOO) detailed below. The period of performance is listed in the SOO below.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to OPM Contracting in response to this notice by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), February 21, 2013. Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov through 10:00 AM EST, February 15, 2013. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Technical and Pricing proposals MUST be in two separate files. If your technical and price proposals are not submitted in two separate files, your response to this solicitation will be considered non-responsive and will not be given any further consideration. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete, so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of and concurrently with the evaluation of the others.<br />All communications shall be directed to the attention of:</p>
<p>Name: Shannon G. Kennedy<br />Title: Contracting Officer<br />Telephone: 304-870-8065<br />Email: Shannon.Kennedy@opm.gov</p>
<p>NOTE: COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFICIALS OTHER THAN THE OPM CONTRACTING OFFICER INDICATED ABOVE, MAY COMPROMISE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THIS ACQUISITION AND RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE SOLICITATION AND/OR EXCLUSION OF YOUR PROPOSAL FROM THIS SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>Vendors not registered in the System for Award Management at the time the requirement is anticipated to be awarded will not be considered. Vendors may register with SAM by accessing www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>PLEASE REVIEW ATTACHED RFQ OPM2613Q0098 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.</p>

<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov.  From the VSC home page, click on Toolbox in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules.  The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for Schedule 56, effective 1/2/13.  The solicitation is available electronically at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCI-F8-03-0056-B (include the dashes).

Schedule 56 actively solicits offers for alternative/renewable energy products and systems, energy efficient products, green products, such as green roof systems, and environmentally friendly products/services.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. Effective January 17, 2011, products added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Numbers  (SINs) 206-4, Energy Saving Lighting, Energy Efficient and/or Environmentally Friendly Lamps (light bulbs)

Certification for Energy Star can be obtained through the website at  www.energystar.gov.

The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the Energy Star, FEMP or EPA website.   Dealers using their own part numbers must also list the corresponding manufacturer part number.  To determine if you are submitting items that are listed in one of the luminaries specifications for items offered under SIN 206 4 please go to http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires and review the ENERGY STAR Luminaries V1.0 Final Specification document.  The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<RESPDATE>022613
<CONTACT>Sheila R. Edmonds, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014966546, Email sheila.edmonds@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM-2013-659/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to assist in obtaining social media and engagement tool software to evaluate on-line resources of the NLM by mining social media. This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511210-Software Publishers.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and makes its stored information available online at no charge to consumers, health professionals, and biomedical scientists through a diverse suite of resources. Evaluating how its databases and other resources are utilized is an important component of continuing quality improvement and has long been an on-going program of NLM management through a potpourri of monitoring tools. The world-wide explosion in the use of social media provides a unique opportunity for sampling sentiment and use patterns of NLM's "customers" and for comparing NLM to other sources of health-related information.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to obtain software capable of examining such social media sites as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites with inquiries relevant to NLM issues and with full respect for privacy rights of those who created the social media entries.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The work requirement will demonstrate an approach to comprehensive access to the target information within a framework that permits NLM to rapidly formulate and process complex queries relevant to evaluation of its programs and those of its "competitors."</p>
<p>Project 1: Monitoring Usage of NLM Resources by Consumers</p>
<p>By examining relevant tweets and other comments, NLM will gain insights to extent of use, context for which information was sought, and effects of various health-related announcements and events on usage patterns including:<br />&bull; Relative frequency with which various NLM resources are mentioned<br />&bull; Comparison of NLM mentions with mentions of "competitors"<br />&bull; Identification of urgent information requests for which NLM could "push" vetted information free of advertising or commercial interest<br />&bull; Effects of topical health issues such as "mad cow" or West Nile Virus or disasters etc. on use of NLM resources<br />&bull; Effect of changing NLM's interface design and textual/graphic style on usage by consumers<br />&bull; Effectiveness of NLM use of social media to distribute health information<br />&bull; Comparable analyses of other NIH, DHHS and private sector health information sources<br />&bull; Demographic characteristics of those whose messages are being examined to the extent permitted by privacy regulations.<br />&bull; Ascertaining public interest in using social media for health-related purpose<br />&bull; Value of tweets and other messages as teaching tools and change-agents for health-relevant behavior</p>
<p>Project 2: Monitoring Usage of NLM Resources by Health Professionals and Biomedical Scientists</p>
<p>By examining relevant tweets and other comments, NLM will gain insights to extent of use, context for which information was sought, and reactions to information provided to clinicians involved in patient care, and scientists focused on research issues, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Citations of published papers available from NLM bibliometric databases<br />&bull; Citations of published papers available from NLM full-text references<br />&bull; Information-seeking behavior of clinicians and scientists<br />&bull; Effects on usage of modifying database design features<br />&bull; Professional comments about value of NLM's resources <br />&bull; Comparison of use of NLM resources to use of those provided by "competitors"<br />&bull; Regional and international differences in information-seeking behavior by professionals</p>
<p>Contractor Responsibility:</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, and equipment, not other&not;wise provided by the Government, to provide the requisite services required to support this requirement which is directly related to the work of the NLM. All work shall be monitored and technically co&not;ordinated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks/Services:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following specific tasks for Projects 1 and 2 in accordance with the respective project descriptions identified above:</p>
<p>Task 1: Install appropriate software on a Government computer(s) that is designed for efficient customer-friendly operation and has option of extending capabilities</p>
<p>Task 2: Maintain a comprehensive "universe" of social media data subject to queries. Content from Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites will be maintained by the Contractor and kept up-to-date in a timely manner and made available for query by Government</p>
<p>Task 3: Provide an appropriate library of relevant search terms appropriate for the questions of interest to NLM. Software must accommodate complex query combinations, and permit ad hoc creation of new query terms and combinations in accord with NLM quotidian interests.</p>
<p>Task 4: Train designated Government personnel in proper use of the licensed software and in efficient formulation of queries</p>
<p>Task 5: Provide on-going consultation as needed to refine queries of importance to Government.</p>
<p>Task 6: Offer improvements to the software as developed from time to time by Contractor</p>
<p>Number of Users:</p>
<p>The Government expects license to cover two (2) users.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>&#9679; Evaluating On-line Resources of the National Library of Medicine by Mining Social Media: The final product will be an installed software package that meets the requirements of the Government for timely retrieval from Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites from the social media information stores maintained and kept current by the Contractor</p>
<p>&#9679; Expert assistance as needed from the Contractor to assist the Government in formulating inquiries with search terms and term combinations that will provide appropriate responses appropriate for the goal of Government questions relevant to the NLM mission</p>
<p>&#9679; Training of at least two (2) Government staff members by Contractor personnel and through on-line resources <br /><br />&#9679; Display of search results in an efficient manner, preferably in dashboard form, suitable for analysis by the Government.<br /><br />&#9679; Periodic updates on status/changes in the social media environment</p>
<p>&#9679; A delivery schedule will be provided by the Contractor within thirty (30) days of the contract</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The resultant purchase order will be for a period of twelve (12) months from Date of Award.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>&bull; On-site at National Library of Medicine</p>
<p>SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE<br />In accordance with FAR 39.2, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is implemented in this order. Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.hhs.gov/od.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among price and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation processes:</p>
<p>A. Technical Merit (50 Points). Understanding of the objectives of this statement of work, and quality and clarity of approach to accomplish the objectives. Evidence that social information resources available are appropriate for the objectives and kept up-to-date. Evidence of ability to accomplish the specific tasks described with methodology that enables NLM to formulate complex queries that can be processed quickly and be displayed in a form suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>B. Personnel Merit (25 Points). Qualifications, experience, and availability for project must be demonstrated in proposal. A resume should be included that documents previous pertinent experience and references in harvesting organization of social media, and in giving users the ability to formulate efficient queries appropriate for the intent of the questions under consideration. Personnel involved in training aspects of the work should be identified.</p>
<p>C. Organizational Capability, Experience, and Commitment (25 Points). Evidence of organization capability to complete projects, install designated software, and provide on-going support to NLM to facilitate its query formulations and related tasks. Does the offerer demonstrate understanding of the NLM mission, and of the themes of interest for which social media will be mined? Has the offerer had previous experience in analysis of social media data in the health and disaster fields? Is there evidence of appropriate training assets in place?</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)<br />The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>1352.209-74: ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<br />(End of clause)</p>

Submission Requirements:   The Contractor shall provide a maximum of seven (7) projects showing specialized experience of the proposed team in provision of the services noted above.  Projects submitted for the Offeror shall have been completed within the five (5) years prior to the date of issuance of this Notice.
  All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part I, Section F, item 25 Firms from Section C Involved in this Project, block (1).    Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21.  Include an e-mail address, and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).  Include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.
  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project.  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

If the Offeror is a joint venture (JV), relevant project experience should be submitted for the joint venture if shared experience is available; if no shared experience is available, offers shall submit at least one project performed by each member of the joint venture.
  Offerors are still limited to a maximum of seven (7) projects.     

Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330 at Part 1 Section F and shall be completed.  Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project.  Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.

Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF330.
  The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF 330 Part 1 Section E and Section G):  Offerors will be evaluated on professional qualifications and competence of the key personnel to be assigned to provide services to accomplish the tasks required under this contract, which must include experience within the five years prior to the date of issuance of this Notice for the services described in Criterion 1.

Criterion 3  Past Performance (SF330, Part 1 Section H): Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, innovation, compliance with schedules, cost control, overall safety record, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction. Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided on Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) for Criterion 1 projects (see submission requirements below) and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.  NOTE:  Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1 will be given greater weight.  

Submission Requirements:  IF A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS AVAILABLE FOR A PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1, IT SHALL BE SUBMITTED WITH THE COMPLETED SF 330 PACKAGE. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1, Specialized Experience. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE.
 

IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF 330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, the offeror should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).

d)	Discuss the location of offices and other key staff members and how this will be advantageous to the Government; and provide a detailed description of the organizational structure and how it will function.  Firms with multiple locations will be considered more favorably given the worldwide coverage of this proposed contract.

Criterion 5  Quality Control (SF 330 Part 1 Section H):  Offerors will be evaluated on the strength of the Quality Control (QC) plan proposed by the firm to ensure quality products under this contract.
  

Submission Requirements:  Discuss the Quality Control Plan that would be utilized for this contract.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) has a requirement to enhance an existing system and also develop new applications on information extraction from free text in the electronic health record.  

Contractor shall be responsible for refining the existing natural language processing (NLP) to analyze additional radiology modalities and report types. Contractor shall expand the capabilities of Chest X-ray Device Extractor (CXDE) so that it is able to process other report types involving the chest, such as CT scans.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>

<p>WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com. <br />(e) Questions concerning payments:<br />(1) DFAS Indianapolis at 1-888-332-7366. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.<br />(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number or invoice number to inquire about the payment.<br />(3) DMA POCs:<br />ACCEPTOR/WAWF/INVOICES: Scott Fidler -- (703) 693-9527 - scott.fidler@usmc.mil <br />CONTRACT SPECIALIST: Claudio Casupang - (951)413-2381 - claudio.casupang@dma.mil<br />CONTRACTING OFFICER: Susan Madrid - (951)413-2371 - susan.madrid@dma.mil</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Casting Padding. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.<strong> The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is October 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><br /><strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert</strong> <strong>Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172109 and Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Casting Tape. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $280,986.53. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, thirty-nine (39) of the total sixty-two (62) line items represent the top eight (8) products and account for 90.75% ($254,299.89) of the total volume in sales $280,986.53 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Rob Halliday, Clinical Analyst, at robert.halliday@us.army.mil and Mr. Tom Winkel, Team Leader, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil. </strong>The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.<br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /></strong>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Casting Padding products.<br />a. This product line, Casting Padding, includes latex-free/safe cotton, sterile and non-sterile items in a variety of sizes to include at a minimum the specific products listed.<br />1) Cotton padding non-sterile 6 inches x 4 yards<br />2) Cotton padding non-sterile 4 inches x 4 yards<br />3) Cotton padding non-sterile 3 inches x 4 yards<br />4) Cotton padding non-sterile 2 inches x 4 yards<br />5) Cotton padding sterile 4 inches x 4 yards<br />6) Cotton padding sterile 2 inches x 4 yards<br />7) Cotton padding sterile 6 inches x 4 yards<br />8) Cotton padding sterile 3 inches x 4 yards<br />*Operational usage items are included in this list of Casting Padding.<br />b. Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of products supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. <br />2. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all products meet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) manufacturing of Orthopedic, Prosthetic, Surgical Appliances and Supplies used in manufacturing Casting Padding.<br />3. Vendor must have or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Casting Padding. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number has been applied for.<br />4. Vendor must have or be in the process of applying for agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Casting Padding, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />5. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all MMESO AORs. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />6. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act and provide date last updated in the DAPA Management System. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System. Vendors not compliant IAW Trade Agreements Act will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendor is advised that the Berry Amendment may apply to this SA, subject to the June 13, 2001 "Class Determination of Domestic Non-Availability for Defense Supply Center Philadelphia Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Programs".</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Europe, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs.<strong> Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00 PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Twenty four (24) rolls/each cotton sterile Casting Padding listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1) Cotton padding sterile 6 inches x 4 yards, 24 rolls<br />2) Cotton padding sterile 3 inches x 4 yards, 24 rolls</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty-one (21) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. NPSG 14.01.01 and Material Performance - The cast padding readily tears allowing uniform padding application. The padding must tear readily and evenly, so as to aid the uniform molding process and prevent any unnecessary pressure against the patient's skin or bony prominences which could cause skin breakdown. <br />2. NPSG 14.01.01 and Material Performance - The cast padding readily molds for a uniform application over body contours. The padding must provide uniform molding so that it does not put unnecessary pressure against the patient's skin or bony prominences that could cause skin breakdown.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<DESC>Solicitation: <br />W912L7-13-T-0001 <br />Agency/Office: <br />National Guard Bureau <br />Location: <br />USPFO for Tennessee <br />Title: <br />W-Linen Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in Lavinia, TN.
<p>Description(s):</p>
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0001 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812320 with a Small Business Size Standard of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the contractor with the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2495 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2495<br />Diane C.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>

<p>Description(s):</p>
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0003 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812320 with a Small Business Size Standard of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the contractor with the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2497 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2497<br />Diane C.

<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes<br />the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br />wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br />similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet.

<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms, Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (JUL 2006) (Deviation) and 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.

<p>Description(s):</p>
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0003 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812320 with a Small Business Size Standard of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the contractor with the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable proposal (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2497 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2497<br />Diane C.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes<br />the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br />wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br />similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms, Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (JUL 2006) (Deviation) and 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2495 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2495<br />Diane C.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) cyber science &amp; technology (S&amp;T) strategic goals. Specifically, this BAA supports the AFRL cyber strategy to: 1) assure and empower the mission; 2) enhance agility and resilience; and 3) invent foundations of trust and assurance.
<p>To support each of these strategic goals, this BAA seeks to procure capabilities that strengthen the foundation of trusted systems, provide resiliency, and integrate the different aspects of cyber operations (attack, defense, and exploitation) as a force multiplier. As such, it supports work in the areas of trusted hardware, trusted software, trusted data, secure systems/architectures, embedded systems, maneuverability, mission awareness, mission assurance, in-situ, run-time survivability and recovery techniques, and effects-based, strategic cyber defense. Supported work should be consistent with the concept of an integrated mission framework for synchronized operations.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate is soliciting white papers in specific focus areas, including cyber agility, polymorphic networks and machines, incorruptible data, codes, and executables, assured execution, survivability, self-regeneration, immune recovery and mission assurance. NOTE: The POC for each focus area is provided for QUESTIONS ONLY. See Section IV Paragraph 6 for submission details.</p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is not limited to the aforementioned focus areas. Other applicable areas of technology include, but are not limited to, rapid computer/network forensics, attack attribution/geolocation, novel protocols, cloud architectures/security, mobile/embedded device security, secure computer/processor architectures, virtualization security, industrial control system security, cyber technology evaluation techniques, cyber modeling, simulation, metrics, and measurements, cyber data mining/understanding, and cyber visualization.</p>
<p><br />FY13 - FY15 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: CYBER AGILITY</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Currently, adversaries can plan their attacks carefully over time by relying on the static nature of our networks, and launch their attacks at the times and places of their choosing. The DoD needs new tools and technologies to reverse the current asymmetry that favors our cyber adversaries, by forcing them to spend more, cope with greater levels of complexity and uncertainty, and accept greater risks of exposure and detection due to the significantly increased requirements for reconnaissance and intelligence collection of our networks. If we control the dynamics of our systems and networks, any deviation from these known dynamics can also provide an opportunity for increased discrimination of attacker activity and unexpected system states. AFRL will pursue Science &amp; Technology for defensive cyber maneuver and agility to disrupt adversary cyberspace operations, including adversary attack planning and execution.</p>
<p>Agility mechanisms must be incorporated in such a way that they are transparent to authorized users, and must introduce minimal functional and performance impacts. We wish to disrupt our adversaries and not ourselves. The security of such mechanisms is also paramount, so that their power is not co-opted by attackers against us for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective is to avoid attacks by making it harder for a determined adversary to succeed by increasing agility, diversity, and redundancy, to disrupt attack planning and execution.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Walt Tirenin<br />&nbsp;(315) 330-1871 <br /><a href="mailto:Walt.Tirenin@rl.af.mil">Walt.Tirenin@rl.af.mil</a></p>
<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: INCORRUPTIBLE DATA CODES / EXECUTABLES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires trustworthy data and software executables for successful performance of assigned missions.<br /><br />Objective: Deliver self-contained, verifiably incorruptible/trustworthy data and executables with protection while at rest, under execution, or in transit upon and within any environment/system relevant to the warfighter. This includes both our own systems and systems that we do not own or directly control.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables" focus area is interested in the research challenges identified below.

<p><br />FY11 &amp; FY12 FOCUS AREA: ASSURED EXECUTION</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The current focus of computer security is at the operating system (e.g. role-based users), applications (e.g. anti-virus programs), and the network (e.g. firewalls). Focus needs to be shifted to the operating system at the hardware and virtualized hardware layers. Innovative technology developments are sought to defend computers and computer networks, and assure dynamic mission objectives.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision of this program is "A trusted execution environment within each device (e.g. computer, network router) that is a platform for conducting cyber defensive operations that uses "out of band" communication, and remains trusted should the host be compromised." The two areas of high interest are 1) Virtualization and 2) Root of Trust.</p>
<p>Virtualization: The combination of complex applications running on complex operating systems presents a very large footprint to attack. Additionally, DoD has very little control over modern shrink-wrapped software applications and operating systems. Current cost concerns prohibit DoD from developing, building, and maintaining their own applications, operating systems, and hardware. Virtualization technologies offer ways to defeat cyber attacks prior to engagement. Key concepts include but are not limited to: A secure environment that encapsulates and protects the operating systems, device drivers, and applications; secure, segregated, inaccessible areas for critical code; and secure communications for critical code processes.</p>
<p>Root of Trust: The integrity of computers and computer networks is dependent on the integrity of the host hardware and host root account. This area of research investigates modeled hardware root of trust that imparts immunity from an adversary with root access to the underlying host. Innovative ways to achieve a secure root of trust on a host are sought. Also sought are ways to achieve a network root of trust.</p>

<p><br />FY 11 &amp; FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: FIGHT THROUGH &amp; SURVIVE WITH MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The DoD has a critical need for information systems that adapt and/or gracefully degrade when unexpected events occur. These systems are subjected to constant change such as overload, component failure, cyber attacks, evolving operational requirements, and/or a dynamic operational environment. A system should adapt to these changes by reconfiguring its resources to provide a different, though acceptable, level of service and security to assure mission essential functions. Without adaptation many important activities receive fewer resources than needed while less important activities waste resources by receiving more resources than necessary. Most existing systems either do not adapt or have ad hoc hardwired mechanisms to accommodate only a small, predefined, set of changes. There are no standard methodologies or common tools to assist application developers in managing this sort of dynamic adaptation.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "survive with mission assurance". This focus area is concerned with runtime assessment and management of resources/assets to ensure mission essential functions and conveying trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Fight Through &amp; Survive with Mission Assurance" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>(1) Cyber Defense Metrics - Identify low-level observable properties and measurable quantities that contribute to the mission based assessment.</p>
<p>(2) Mission Aware Adaptive Tradeoffs - Integration of QoS (Functionality) and QoIA (Security) management. There is a need to understand tradeoff policy and de-confliction of QoS and QoIA based on the mission. There is a need to develop fine-grained tunable IA mechanisms and controls.</p>
<p>(3) Survivability Architecture- Compose a survivability architecture that supports and enforces service delivery and information assurance requirements based on mission priorities.<br />Funding for this focus area is not available in FY12.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Pat Hurley <br />(315) 330-3624 <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span><a href="mailto:Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil">atrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil</a></p>
<p><br />FY 11 &amp; 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: SELF-REGENERATIVE INCORRUPTIBLE ENTERPRISE THAT DYNAMICALLY RECOVERS WITH IMMUNITY</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Existing approaches to information system security and survivability consist of preventing, detecting and containing unintentional errors and/or cyber attacks. The problem with this approach is that regardless of how well systems are protected or how well they tolerate errors and/or attacks; they will eventually fail over time unless they have the ability to self-regenerate. Once a successful cyber attack is discovered the adversary can quickly use the same attack over and over again to cause the same negative effect on our mission. Existing systems are currently taken offline and out of the fight for hours to days to be repaired and there is no guarantee that the repair is immune to the attack or variants of the attack. What are needed are information systems that are able to dynamically recover with immunity in mission time without human intervention in response to unforeseen errors and/or previously unknown cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "recover with immunity". This focus area is concerned with recovering with immunity from errors and/or cyber attacks to ensure mission critical systems stay in the fight.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p><br />(1) Persistent applications (data &amp; state) - The goal of this technology area is to make applications hard to corrupt, disable or remove (like malware). When an attack is successful these applications find a way to keep performing the mission.</p>
<p>(2) Machine Generated Reconstitution - The goal of this technology area is to automatically machine-generate repairs to recover with immunity from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(3) Reconstitution of Data and State - The goal of this technology area is mission continuation by automatically repairing corrupted data &amp; state to remove residue from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(4) Understanding Synthetic Diversity or other technology used to recover with immunity - There is a need to better understand the use of synthetic diversity or other technology used to ensure complete attack space coverage and/or understand the effectiveness against various classes of cyber attack.</p>
<p>Funding for the Self-Regenerative Incorruptible Enterprise focus area in FY12 will focus on persistent applications (data &amp; state).</p>

<p><br />FY13 - FY15 FOCUS AREA: CYBER MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This focus is on novel approaches to assure critical Air Force mission essential functions (MEF) in a contested cyber environment. Mission assurance seeks to codify a top-down approach for mapping MEF dependence on cyberspace across the information lifecycle (information generation, processing, storage, transmission, consumption and destruction), identifying cyber vulnerabilities, developing metrics to assess the risk from cyber vulnerabilities on MEF, and developing strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities. We view mission assurance in the context of preventing and avoiding threats by deterring potential threats through increased costs and reduced benefits.</p>
<p>We seek a scientific basis for mission assurance, including the development of mathematical models to represent MEF dependence on cyber, an exploration of the fractal nature of mission mapping, and the development of metrics for the cost of vulnerability mitigation in proportion to the increased cost to potential threats. These will in turn enable the development of more rigorous approaches to situational understanding as well as command and control.<br /><br />Research into cloud computing technologies could provide potential solutions to the mission assurance research area by increasing the availability and redundancy of continuous or contingency operations. We invite novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture. We seek solutions that utilize the dynamic characteristics of cloud computing technology to prevent and avoid threats. Under the establishment of an internal center of excellence in cloud computing, there is a need for further research within AFRL and the DoD community. The center of excellence should provide opportunities for this research through collaboration and related internships.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Create a scientific basis for mission assurance.<br /><br />&bull; Provide novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture.<br /><br />&bull; Construct appropriate research opportunities within the DoD community.<br /><br />&bull; Support other S&amp;T initiatives in the areas of situational understanding and command and control</p>

<p>(4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>

This effort provides network equipment and software maintenance, and direct customer support for user access to, and information transfer, over the Non-Classified internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Local Area Network (LAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR) and launch agencies by providing qualified personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, specialized test equipment, supervision, and other items and services as necessary. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The WROCI requires an innovative, integrated, flexible and effective management approach and the contractor must provide technical support in a planned and coordinated manner which will ensure essential Western Range support systems are ready to support user requirements, and cause no impact to Range program schedules due to equipment degradation, failures, system problems or reprioritization of program requirements. The wide variety of support systems involves careful workload planning and scheduling of resources to identify and resolve technical systems problems. The contractor will be required to maintain and operate Department of Defense (DoD) computers, radios, communication centers, voice and data switching, and common-user telephone systems, interface with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and assess the impact of integrating new Communication systems into the WR and base-wide infrastructure. The contractor will be required to operate the Network Control Center (NCC) and perform site observation and security services as defined in the statement of work. The WR encompasses a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean. Instrumentation sites are located at VAFB, other California coastal sites. Mobile instrumentation and measurement resources are deployed to other ranges, centers, and laboratories to meet Range customer requirements. The WR receives and provides Range support to and from various agencies, to include but not limited to, the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Pacific Missile Range Facility, NASA Space Centers, 45th Space Wing (45 SW), 452nd Flight Test Squadron (452nd FTS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Aerospace Defense Command, US Space Command (USSPACECOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), US Coast Guard, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), and Reagan Test Site (RTS). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The 30 SW is responsible for providing Range capability to conduct and support activities for spacelift, ballistic missile, and aeronautical programs. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The WR is part of the Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports DoD, NASA, commercial, and other user launch, orbital tracking, and test programs. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) operations described above. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This eighteen month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This extension of services will further allow for the future competitive procurement for these services under the LISC to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>InDyne, Inc., is the only responsible offeror for extension of these services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension.

<a href="mailto:david.a.gannon.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION:  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance.  <br>    <br>  2. PURPOSE:  <br>    <br>  The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following:  <br>    <br>    Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and <br>    <br>    Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.    <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army.  <br>    <br>  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly.  <br>    <br>  3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  <br>    <br>  The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S. <br>   <br>  The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station. <br>   <br>  Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope. <br>   <br>  This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy. <br>   <br>  4. TARGET AUDIENCE:  <br>    <br>  All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI.  <br>    <br>  5.

<DESC>The US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Branch, is seeking sources for building and delivering a Mine Stalker III, anti-tank (AT) landmine detection system. The Mine Stalker III system, previously developed by the Humanitarian Demining Branch, integrates a NIITEK ground penetrating radar (GPR) array with navigation and positioning sensor data onto an AT mine survivable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Multidrive 4x4 tractor to accurately detect and mark suspect AT mine locations in roads. The Government seeks to procure a second prototype Mine Stalker III to evaluate performance in multiple geographical locations. The intent of this market research is to identify potential sources for building and delivering a second Mine Stalker III system and associated spare parts for a humanitarian demining operational field evaluation in mined areas outside the continental United States (OCONUS). In addition to delivering a Mine Stalker III system, sources are sought with further capabilities to develop and test enhancements to the system that can minimize operator training requirements and improve the reliability, detection performance, false alarm rate, user-interface and sensor calibration routines. Responses should include a description of the offerors capability to conduct hardware and software development and testing on vehicle mounted detection systems and on the Mine Stalker III system specifically.   <br>    <br>  The Government will accept responses from sources with a demonstrated ability to build an integrated system that meets the following performance criteria: 1) operate a 3.2-m wide array of the latest model NIITEK GPR antennas and associated detection and graphical user interface software, 2) process sensor data real-time with automatic target recognition algorithms that detect AT landmine targets, 3) integrate differential GPS and inertial measurement unit data to digitally map sensor path and alarm locations with centimeter level accuracy, 4) integrate an automatic braking and marking system to stop the vehicle on each detection and physically mark the suspect target locations, 5) provide in-vehicle display and secondary wireless remote display of diagnostic information of each critical subsystem and 3-D visualization of alarm data, 6) provide in-vehicle controls for the sensor mount, data and power management, 7) provide a mounting bracket with the capability to auto-level the GPR array during detection operations and stowing the GPR array during transportation, 8) integrate all systems onto a Multidrive 4x4 tractor, 9) provide a comprehensive spare parts package to support an OCONUS evaluation for a period of no less than 12 months.  <br>    <br>  Potential sources are also asked to describe capabilities to make enhancements to the current Mine Stalker III system. Specifically, the Government is seeking sources capable of improving the detection and false alarm performance against AT landmine threats in humanitarian demining operational environments, and capable of developing additional features for the Mine Stalker III such as remote control, routines for sensor auto calibration, integration of the system onto other commercial-off-the-shelf platforms and other hardware and software improvements to the system that will be identified during evaluation of the Mine Stalker III system in live operational environments.  <br>    <br>  Sources possessing the capability to produce a Mine Stalker III system that satisfy the requirements listed are invited to submit a White Paper not to exceed 10 pages in length providing a description of their system. The White Paper must include at a minimum: 1) a description of their system and validating information supporting the claims that the proposed system meets the system requirements, 2) technical specifications of their system, 3) any performance data of their system against AT mine targets, 4) estimated cost for building a system that meets the system requirements, 5) estimated schedule for delivery of the system, 6) a description of capabilities to develop enhancements to the system.

<a href="mailto:claudetta.n.smith.civ@mail.mil">MICC - Fort Hood</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Operational Test Command, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD) intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to Trex Enterprises Corporation, 10455 Pacific Center Court, San Diego, CA 92121-4339,  to develop new capabilities in the existing Geometric Automated Video Location System (GAVELS), produce GAVELS hardware and software for the ABNSOTD, and to provide GAVELS sustainment support for all GAVELS systems at ABSNOTD and FIRES Test Directorate (FTD). To award to a contractor other than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government as well as cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the ABNSOTD's requirements. The current GAVELS was developed to score artillery rounds for the FTD. This contract will develop the additional capability for the existing GAVELS-NVC to track paratroopers. Upon completion of the development, the upgraded system consisting of eight Data Collection Systems, one Data Reduction System, a Remote Control System and all system software will be delivered to ABNSOTD. Period of performance for the IDIQ contract is 36 months from date of award. Total estimated cost for this effort to include sustainment and the upgrade, development and production of the GAVELS is approximately $4,502,441.00 for three (3) years. The minimum expenditure on the contract is estimated to be $869,727 and the maximum $4,502,441.00. The current GAVELS was awarded competitively to TREX under contract W9115U-11-C-0003 and the government requires enhanced systems capabilities to meet mission essential needs.  <br>  <br> FTD and ABNSOTD at times share GAVELS assets. For this reason, it is imperative that the FTD and ABNSOTD systems be 100% compatible.  The FTD GAVELS and the ABNSOTD GAVELS shall maintain a competitive software package that allows each GAVELS to be interchangeable. The Government currently owns GAVELS 1.0 software and the technical data package, which is the baseline for the GAVELS. The technical data package that the Government is in possession of consists of Binary (executable) software files required for operation of all GAVELS components and subsystems, the Server SDK consisting of Trex ImageServer SDK, consisting of all header and import library files for all Trex ImageServer and Trex Telescope Toolkit modules used in the GAVELS system, allowing the government to make future modifications and extensions to the GAVELS system, all 3rd-party software modules used by the GAVELS, including Software Development Kits (SDKs), etc.,  source codes for all GAVELs-specific modules developed under the GAVELS contract and all software licenses acquired using GAVELS contract funds. The Government is also licensed for unlimited use and distribution of all Trex-developed software components mentioned. Although the Government owns a technical data package, the Government does not own the source codes to Trex's pre-existing modules and libraries that are currently being used with GAVELS 1.0. The Government only has access to the header and binary form. Without these source codes a vendor will encounter difficulties successfully accomplishing the work required to upgrade and perform sustainment work on the existing GAVELS as well as design, test and develop new software and hardware to ensure uniformity of performance and operation within the two systems.

<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Background.</strong> The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. The Division of the NTP supports the program. The NTP maintains an objective, science-based approach in dealing with critical issues in toxicology and is committed to using the best science available to prioritize, design, conduct, and interpret its studies. To that end, the NTP is continually evolving to remain at the cutting edge of scientific research and to develop and apply new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Purpose and Objective.</strong> <strong>(A)</strong> In carrying out its mission, the NTP studies the effects of environmental agents in laboratory studies, which are performed predominantly at contract laboratories and then reviewed by the NTP. The NTP carries out a number of testing paradigms, covering high-throughput testing, in-life testing, in vitro models, and other biological systems, with the aim of generating high-quality data to support the mission of the NTP.<br />On an annual basis, NTP selects approximately 10 new chemicals for testing, has 20 to 30 subchronic studies and 30 to 40 chronic studies in different stages of testing and evaluation, and presents approximately 15 subchronic and chronic studies for public peer review. An additional 10 to 30 reproductive and developmental studies and 20 immunotoxicology studies is also peer reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> The NTP receives data from contract laboratories, and houses these data in a Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) or in local or ad hoc systems. The LIMS currently used are the hosted Provantis database and the custom legacy LIMS. The Hosted LIMS is provided by Instem LSS while the legacy LIMS was developed under contract and has two components: Toxicology Data Management System Enterprise (TDMSE), and Laboratory Data Management System (LDAS). Once the data are made public, the entire dataset (data and metadata) from the study is transferred to the Chemical Effects in Biological Systems database (CEBS) where the study data and conclusions are presented to the public and made available for download.</p>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> In addition, up to 50 high-throughput assays are performed, and up to 50 genetic toxicology studies are completed each year. The NTP also performs investigational studies using emerging technologies, with one-off designs, will perform studies to investigate other areas of toxicology and environmental health science, and has legacy data not currently housed in a relational database which must be included in a data stream to CEBS.</p>
<p><strong>(D)</strong> The NTP must manage, house, and report the data from this scientific work. The NTP requires the Contractor to perform this task. The Contractor shall be capable of (1) providing user support for the NTP for CEBS and the LIMS and for members of the public for the use of CEBS and (2) maintaining normal operating processes for NTP's use of the LIMS and CEBS.</p>
<p><strong>(E)</strong> Also, CEBS currently does not contain the complete set of functionality desired by the NTP. The Contractor shall design and incorporate new functionality into CEBS at the request of the NTP.</p>
<p><strong>4. Project Requirements. <br /></strong><br /><strong>1. (Operational Tasks) <br /></strong>Operational tasks are performed throughout the lifespan of the contract. Successful completion of these tasks requires an understanding of toxicological science in addition to strong understanding of computer science and information technology (IT).<br /><br /><strong>1.1 User Support<br />1.1.1 CEBS Support<br />Current Issue:</strong> Members of the public and of the NTP require assistance in obtaining data from CEBS.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall provide staff to assist users in routine use of CEBS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> CEBS users have a point of contact for questions, common questions are captured and rendered in CEBS as a help or workflow, bugs are identified and resolved expeditiously, questions requiring direct database access are answered in a timely manner, and modifications are made to the CEBS UI to allow users to address similar questions in the future.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.2 SIFT File Creation<br />Current Issue:</strong> Users provide data in various formats for deposition into CEBS. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Data received by the NTP for CEBS shall be formatted for entry into CEBS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The Contractor shall support this process by converting the deposited data into a validated SIFT (Simple Investigation Formatted Text) file for loading into CEBS. The process of SIFT creation may be manual, or automated for numerous data files in a consistent format, at the discretion of the COR. Approximately 100 - 150 such files are presented in a year. <br /><br /><strong>1.1.3 CEBS Presentations at Meetings<br />Current Issue:</strong> Every year the NTP demonstrates CEBS at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Toxicology (SOT). <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall provide staff to assist with the demonstration of CEBS at scientific meetings.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The contractor shall supply staff knowledgeable about toxicology and the use of CEBS to attend scientific and/or technical meetings and provide a daily session during the meeting where CEBS is demonstrated to the scientists attending the meeting. One to two meetings are expected annually.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.4 User Support for the Hosted LIMS <br />Current Issue:</strong> The contractor supplying the Hosted LIMS provides user support, but does not support the needs of the NTP to have data presented in specific report formats and who need advice about protocol templates or work schedules. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall assist users in use of the Hosted LIMS for NTP users requiring special help. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The staff provided will create tables for NTP users using for example the Business Objects tool supplied by Instem and attached to the Provantis database. This task requires understanding of as well as experience with Provantis itself. The Contractor shall provide assistance for NTP staff or contractors who may have questions about using the Hosted LIMS, if requested by the COR. The Contract staff will communicate closely with the COR and NTP staff to fully gather requirements and constraints for the tables and staff support.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.5 The Hosted LIMS User Support for NTP Protocol Templates<br />Current Issue:</strong> Studies are created in the Hosted LIMS from specific NTP protocol templates within the Hosted LIMS database. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall understand and advise NTP personnel about the impact of suggested changes in NTP protocol templates in the Hosted LIMS. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> If a change is required, the Contractor shall make the change in the NTP template, and, if requested by the COR, perform testing to determine if the change functions as expected. Changes made to the Hosted LIMS database templates will follow the established GLP change control process, be thoroughly documented and coordinated with the NTP Validation Team and the Hosted LIMS database Administrator.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.6 The Hosted LIMS User Support for the Hosted LIMS System Libraries and System Security <br />Current Issue:</strong> The NTP will identify changes or additions required in the system configuration or library content of the Hosted LIMS. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall implement changes to the Hosted LIMS System Libraries and System Security, using either the NTP Change Control process or the NTP Process for Making Administrative Changes in the Hosted Database as directed by the COR.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Changes made to the Hosted LIMS libraries will follow the established GLP change control process, be thoroughly documented and coordinated with the NTP Validation Team and the NTP Hosted LIMS Administrator.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.7 Legacy LIMS User Support<br />Current Issue:</strong> Legacy LIMS must be maintained and supported.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Legacy LIMS shall be maintained, and staff shall be provided to respond to user-identified issues or account maintenance requests, security needs, changes in operating systems and other similar changes. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Contractor shall assign a liaison to each lab collecting NTP data using LDAS, with the responsibility to solve or capture any issues that the lab personnel encounter while using the Legacy LIMS. Liaisons are expected to be on-call and available for work on an ad hoc basis during evening and weekend hours. User-identified issues, security needs, changes in operating systems, and other similar changes will be collected in a Government-provided task management system currently Jira, and reviewed with the COR for prioritization and inclusion into a maintenance release. The Contractor shall carry out such a release as directed. It is anticipated that the NTP will end the use of LDAS to collect data from new studies after one year from the start of the contract. The Contractor shall retire TDMSE as directed; house the data in such a way that the data can be searched if need be.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Data Management<br />1.2.1 Loading of Production CEBS<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP constantly updates NTP data.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The NTP data shall be refreshed in the production CEBS database at least quarterly. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Regularly, and at least quarterly, re-build one of the two production databases, validate the build, and then point the CEBS user interface to the newest database. Currently there are approximately 2500 studies in CEBS, and the number is expected to grow annually. With every update of the CEBS database, a parallel update of the CEBS bulk data download "Bundles" is also required. Each update requires debugging, post-processing and validation. A report of the number and type of studies loaded successfully, and a report of the CEBS data dictionary shall be included with each load.<br /><br /><strong>1.2.2 NTP File Management<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP data is stored in a variety of files.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Create and manage an orderly file management system for NTP data files<br /><strong>Desired outcomes:</strong> The Contract shall perform an inventory of files associated with CEBS studies, and develop a central point for storing all data files. The files shall be managed using both manual and automated processes, and an inventory maintained. A report of the data file inventory shall be produced with each new load of CEBS production.<br /><br /><strong>1.2.3 Management of CEBS Bins<br />Current issue:</strong> Public access to and the administration of the CEBS private file system ("Bins") is inefficient.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a user interface for CEBS Bins to allow users to manage their data. <br /><strong>Desired outcome:</strong> Develop a user interface with at a minimum the following features:<br />&bull; A system for authorizing users to upload or remove data files from their CEBS bin<br />&bull; A means for authorized users can create sub-bins, and can select the users authorized to view/delete/upload data in these bins from the list of authorized users in CEBS. <br />&bull; A means for an authorized user to upload individual files or directories.<br /><br /><strong>1.2.4 CEBS Administrative Page<br />Current Issue:</strong> Maintenance of the CEBS data dictionary is a manual process<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a tool to permit CEBS curators to review and update the CEBS databases<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> A tool for adding terms to the CEBS data dictionary shall be created. Additionally a process for term review shall be created; this process shall include the COR and members of the NTP staff as directed by the COR. Generate SOPs for adding terms to the dictionary. On a regular basis, or at least bi-annually, survey the dictionary to identify incorrect or redundant terms.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Validation<br />1.3.1 Validation of Code Changes<br />Current Issue:</strong> Code changes can have unintended consequences or unwarranted assumptions.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Code shall be tested prior to release.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> With every code change in either CEBS or TDMSE/LDAS, prior to release of the code, the Contractor shall demonstrate that the changes have not impacted the validity of the data in CEBS or the presentation of data to the CEBS user. The process of validating code shall be converted to an automated protocol where possible.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.2 Validation of Data Streams<br />Current Issue:</strong> Data streams must be validated to ensure that no data are dropped or coded incorrectly.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The data transfer process shall be validated as part of developing code to handle the data stream for every new data stream coming to CEBS or to the PWG module.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Each data stream for each load will be tested for complete data transfer to ensure that no new data were added to the input form and that all data are correctly captured in CEBS. When possible, the validation should be performed using automated methods and incorporated into routine testing at each loading.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.3 Validation of the CEBS Database Functioning<br />Current Issue:</strong> The CEBS database is non-responsive at erratic times.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Contractor shall monitor CEBS performance on an automated basis. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes: </strong>The Contractor shall have a suite of tools which verifies the response and user experience of CEBS and establish automated methods to carry out CEBS validation. This includes a system to monitor CEBS system availability and response time in real time, and to verify the accuracy and completeness of data in CEBS in user interface search pages. The Contractor shall maintain logs from such methods and summarize weekly for the COR.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.4 Validation of Changes to the Hosted LIMS<br />Current Issue:</strong> The hosted database is housed in a GLP validated environment, meaning that it is in compliance with the guidance from the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) for Good Laboratory Practice as outlined in 21 CRF Parts 11 and 58, and from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Parts 160 and 792. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> When changes are needed in the templates, in security settings, roles or endpoints, when a new release or update of the Hosted LIMS is received, or any other change is required in the Hosted LIMS, the Contractor shall validate these changes as directed by the NTP Validation Team, the NTP Hosted LIMS Administrator, in coordination with the COR.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Contractor shall follow the NTP GLP Validation Change Control Process or, when appropriate, following the NTP Administrative Change process. Additionally, new statistical methods in the Hosted LIMS must be validated as they are added to the Hosted LIMS by Instem. The Contractor shall verify that the method returns the expected value for a particular set of test data. This verification shall conform to the NTP Change Control process. The COR shall direct all changes made to the Hosted LIMS. <br /><br /><strong>1.4 Work Environment<br />The NTP is a responsive government agency which acts in the public interest. As such, it is likely that changing NTP priorities will impact the priority and sequence of tasks. It is likely that the NTP will add additional tasks not specifically listed here, but which are within scope of the Contract. The Contractor is expected to be accommodating to changes of this nature, and to work with the COR to prioritize and incorporate tasks.<br /><br />1.4.1 Regulatory Compliance<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP is part of the NIEHS computer infrastructure, and subject to regulations related to computer and infrastructure security and compliance with federal regulations such as Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The NTP is also subject to records management regulations.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor is expected to be compliant with NIEHS, NIH and HHS regulations. <br /><strong>Desired Objectives:</strong> The Contractor shall be compliant with NIEHS, NIH and HHS regulations. These include but are not limited to Section 508, security and records management. The Contractor shall perform all work in compliance with regulations and document this compliance with an annual security and 508 compliance reports, and responsiveness to interim security requirements which may arise.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain files in accordance with the appropriate current National Archives and Record Administration (NARA), and General Records Schedule (36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 122014 and 44 U.S.C. 3301). All contractor files, records, and documents maintained in the performance of the resultant contract are Government Property and the Contractor shall return them upon completions or termination of the work. However, internal proprietary contractor business files are not Government property.</p>
<p><strong>1.4.2 Collaboration with Government Staff and Other Contractors<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP details government staff to work on parts of the overall CEBS and the Hosted LIMS projects, in parallel with the Contractor. The Computer Technology Branch (CTB) details staff and contractors to work on CEBS support. Instem details staff to work on the Provantis database. This work environment requires close communication among these groups in order to accomplish these separate tasks in an efficient manner. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> NTP staff and Contractor staff working on CEBS and the Hosted LIMS shall communicate regularly and transparently about the technical details of work relating to CEBS and the Hosted and legacy LIMS. Contractor staff shall communicate with CTB and other components of NIEHS, Instem and their delegates, as needed and in coordination with the COR. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> A 10 minute response time from Contractor staff during normal business hours (9am to 6pm, eastern local standard time). Weekly meetings to ensure that the Government and Contractor teams work is coordinated, not-overlapping, and separated by function. It is expected that some members of contractor staff shall be stationed at the NTP facility. The Contractor shall interface with other contractors and federal employees as necessary to perform daily operations.<br /><br /><strong>1.4.3 Documentation and Version Control<br />Current issue:</strong> Contractor using government tools to manage work.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Contractor shall use government supplied tools to manage work tickets, version control and non-end user documentation.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The Contractor staff shall use government-supplied tools for work tickets, version control and non-end user documentation. Currently, these are Jira, Confluence, and Subversion.<br /><br /><strong>1.4.4 Knowledge Transfer<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP and NIEHS provide training and other opportunities for knowledge transfer which permit Contractor staff to more properly fulfill their tasks.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Contractor staff shall participate in training and local seminars at the discretion of the COR at their own expense.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Contract staff shall participate in opportunities for learning provided by the NIEHS and NTP or other local ICs and companies. Typically, these have no costs associated with them. These are provided so that the Contract staff may perform their tasks with more efficiency and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 IT Support.<br />1.5.1 Inventory<br />Current Issue:</strong> The LDAS in-life and administrative workstations in contractors' labs must function well while they are in use for work under NTP contracts. The Government requires an inventory of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Contractor Acquired Purchases (CAP).<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain and support the inventory associated with the contract.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Maintain LDAS units in labs in good working order. Maintain an inventory of parts to support LDAS workstations. Collect or abandon-in-place LDAS in-life and admin workstations, and dispose of these once all in-life work using LDAS has ceased or the Contractor Laboratory no longer has need for them. <br /><br /><strong>1.5.2 Security<br />Current Issue:</strong> There are rare instances of security incidents involving the systems managed under this contract.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> All security incidents will be identified rapidly, communicated to the NTP, and resolved efficiently in accordance with the contract.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The Contractor shall provide immediate notification of any security incident, followed by a report within 48 hours of the remediation. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide weekly reports of failed access to CEBS private data and all LIMS, and weekly summaries of log files.<br /><br /><strong>1.5.3 Hardware/Software Support<br />Current Issue:</strong> Contractor staff requires good capacity workstations and servers, high-speed access to the internet in order to access the NIEHS computational facility, and up-to-date software.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall provide all necessary services, hardware and software licenses for the contract, and training in necessary systems at no cost to the Government. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The Contractor staff shall have the necessary support to be able to work efficiently. The Government recommends the use of COTS products where possible, to avoid unnecessary expense involved in developing and supporting software, however, the CEBS database is currently so unique that no commercial analog can be identified.<br /><br /><strong>1.5.4 The Hosted LIMS Exports<br />Current issue:</strong> The LIMS supplier provides a copy of the Hosted LIMS database on a weekly basis. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall receive the copy of the Hosted LIMS database export, verify that it is accurate and complete, and store it safely at the NIEHS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The NTP shall have a current copy of the Hosted LIMS data available to ensure data continuity.<br /><br /><strong>1.5.5 Use of the Internet Cloud<br />Current issue:</strong> Development options are wider if some development work is performed on the cloud.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Establish a cloud instance of CEBS which contains data of size and complexity equivalent to production CEBS but which is not actual NIH data. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Use this to prototype different options for warehouse architecture, queries, bioinformatics tools, Tox21 data presentation, and other tasks for which the NIEHS network is less well suited than the internet cloud.</p>
<p><strong>1.5.6 Technology Assessment and Refreshment<br />Current Issue:</strong> IT technology and NTP requirements develop rapidly, making new tools available and current technologies obsolete.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect suggestions from the NTP and from IT professionals and incorporate into proposals for updates and improvements to CEBS. Implement these proposals as directed.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Capture user needs, and then assist COR in evaluating suggested improvements/refreshments. Contractor shall ensure that Contractor staff remains current with IT technology through reading, communication with other IT professionals, and through attendance at technical meetings. As requested by the COR, develop proposals to incorporate new functionality and/or new technology into CEBS. These proposals will be incorporated into the tasks in the next section of this document.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2 (Development Tasks)<br />In addition to operational tasks done on a continuing basis throughout the lifespan of the contract, the NTP requires that the following tasks be completed, starting at the time of contract award. The COR shall work with the Contractor to fully define the requirements and assumptions for each task, and the priority of tasks with in this list. These tasks are performed in support of the NTP mission and rely on strong science as well as strong IT understanding. It is possible that the order of tasks, and the exact requirements of these various tasks, will vary as the priorities of the NTP are changed. The COR shall work with the Contractor to accommodate these changes.<br /><br />2.1 New Data Types<br />Current issue:</strong> New data types, new technologies, and new study designs are used by the NTP in support of the NTP mission.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> As new data types and study designs are received, it is necessary to model these for incorporation into the CEBS and for proper display in the CEBS user interface and then incorporate them into CEBS. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The new data shall be added to the CEBS database using the SIFT (Simple Investigation Formatted Text) file format and the CEBS loader. This process requires thoughtful discussion by the Contractor with the COR and members of NTP staff prior to incorporation. The CEBS database may need to be changed by the addition of a new table or field to accommodate such requests. New presentation of the data shall be added to CEBS user interface in addition to the standard CEBS view of the data. The NTP anticipates changes needed to display study phases, generations, and results of data transformations, results of assay panels, data from new NTP legacy study types, and additional data which will be encountered over the course of the contract. Successful completion of these tasks requires an understanding of the various data found in different NTP studies, and how these same data are captured and represented in CEBS, in addition to a strong background in IT. <br /><br /><strong>2.2 Data Pipelines<br />Current Issue:</strong> Current data streams to CEBS may be error-prone, and do not encompass all NTP data.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure that all NTP data flows into CEBS in an accurate and complete manner.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Current methods shall be validated, NTP legacy data not currently in CEBS, which at a minimum will include data from ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), TK (Toxicokinetic) studies, Immunotoxicology and historical comet studies, and clinical chemistry and reproductive data stored in a legacy relational database, shall be moved to CEBS. Methods to capture data from NTP contract labs shall be established and validated. Data from legacy database, contract labs, and the Hosted LIMS database shall be linked to the corresponding animal ID.<br /><br /><strong>2.3 Computations<br />Current Issues:</strong> The computations in CEBS do not encompass all that are needed by the NTP. Instem will incorporate new statistical methods into the Hosted LIMS database suite which must be validated.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Add and validate statistical and computational methods to CEBS user interface and backend analysis server in consultation with COR. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> This task is to incorporate and validate existing software in the public domain rather than to develop new statistical methods, however strong understanding of the CEBS database schema and of statistical and visual data mining methods is required for successful completion of this task. Software to incorporate include at a minimum (1) the EPA's Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) software, (2) the functionality of the Genetic Alterations in Cancer user interface, (3) the signature calling algorithm from Drug Matrix, (4) visual methods for viewing data in CEBS using a software package such as the Spotfire package from TIBCO, (5) supervised statistical analyses such as ANOVA or trend tests, (6) genome-wide association tools such as EMMA and QTLRel. Provide CEBS workflows restricting the user to the correct method for each data type.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 CEBS features<br />Current issues:</strong> CEBS does not contain all the features required by the NTP.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Incorporate new features identified by the NTP into the CEBS user interface and database.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The features to be added will be described by the NTP; examples include the following: <br />&bull; CEBS shall have a historical control database for all NTP study types including appropriate meta-data. <br />&bull; NTP conclusions shall be incorporated into the CEBS database where possible, and made available to the user for searching. <br />&bull; After discussion with NTP staff about methods to generalize; add new workflow to CEBS to allow users to carry out common queries. <br />&bull; A CEBS view shall exist for each of the NTP Search pages (see http://ntp-apps.niehs.nih.gov/ntp_tox/index.cfm). Ensure that all data included on NTP Search pages are also displayed by CEBS. <br />&bull; Transfer all NTP search page functionality to CEBS. This will include moving the statistical methods including trend tests and poly-k test run on data from CEBS. It is possible that the NTP will augment the current statistical tests with others; if this is the case these new tests shall also be included.<br />&bull; Automate the transfer of data from the static Sites and Associations workflow currently in CEBS to include all studies in CEBS.<br />&bull; Develop methodology to capture, manage and report data from literature curation derived by NTP and/or from external scientists<br />&bull; Permit the user to enter in CEBS a list of test articles or conclusions to retrieve results, rather than restricting the query input to one item. Validate the query input terms against terms in CEBS prior to executing the query. Build a new workflow in the CEBS user interface to support this.<br />&bull; Develop a secure method for expert NTP staff to search all of the data in CEBS.<br />The Contractor shall deliver a document outlining the requirements and technical approach and gain approval from the COR before initiating work. <br /><br /><strong>2.5 CEBS Ontology<br />Current issue:</strong> The CEBS Ontology is not complete.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a CEBS Ontology that can be used to draw conclusions and reason about NTP studies.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Complete creation of the CEBS SIFT Ontology by ensuring that the terms used in CEBS to describe neoplastic, non-neoplastic, clinical pathology endpoints and organs are mapped to existing external ontologies, and that the data needed to support each study conclusion is expressed as an RDF triple. Leverage the CEBS ontology to draw conclusions about CEBS data using the semantic web and logical reasoning, and integrate this data stream into CEBS. Identify to the user which conclusions are computationally derived. Develop tools to carry out natural language processing (NLP) to derive conclusion data from NTP Technical Reports provided in electronically readable format and deposit in CEBS. Add toxicological knowledge to CEBS by surveying the literature as directed by the COR. Ensure that the terminology used in the Hosted LIMS database is aligned with current requirements defined by the COR and the Provantis Steering Team. Ensure that the vocabulary used in CEBS is aligned with current NTP requirements as defined by COR and the NTP ABC (Advisory Board for CEBS).<br /><br /><strong>2.6 Bioinformatics<br />Current issue:</strong> CEBS does not leverage bioinformatics knowledge in delivering information to users.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Bioinformatics annotation and tools will be incorporated into CEBS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Add bioinformatics capability to CEBS - align sequence IDs among transcriptomics platforms and across species. Add tools to link genes to the relevant pathway and function described in the Gene Ontology. Add tools for users to identify gene signature expression changes (signature), and to determine if the associated changes in annotated pathways and sets show significant changes in a particular gene signature. Incorporate these results in the CBS user interface. Add gene-centric queries to the user interface - permit the user to load or compute a gene signature and then to identify test articles related to the signature. Implement clustering or other unsupervised methods to permit users to combine high capacity data such as high-throughput or transcriptomics data with phenotype data such as histopathology findings for analysis. Use software packages such as Spotfire or Bioconductor for this task. Add network analysis/connectivity analysis capability to the CEBS UI, using tools such as those in the public domain.<br /><br /><strong>2.7 Warehouse<br />Current issue:</strong> CEBS is currently based on a relational database design.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a data warehouse or appropriate system linked to CEBS to permit users to draw conclusions and find relationships across studies and data domains while still being able to drill down to access the underlying individual animal data.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Prototype and develop CEBS warehouse to capture/compute NTP conclusions and link to supporting data. Ensure that the technology selected supports real-time use by standard users. <br /><br />Assess the technology used to build the CEBS user interface and back-end code. If this technology requires updating to leverage new technology and to more smoothly interface with the CEBS warehouse user interface, then develop a plan for this in collaboration with NTP staff and the COR. Put this plan into place as directed by the COR. Add data mining tools to identify correlations in responses seen in CEBS and then augment a search by suggesting additional terms (e.g. if a user enters a list of test articles into CEBS, and the CEBS data mining routine has identified a test article with similar (R&gt;.8) result, return this new test article and determine if the user would like to include / see results for this test article).</p>
<p>Develop and test a user interface to the CEBS Warehouse. Permit the users to search conclusions at the Study, Trial, Group, and Subject or Assay Input/organ level, Gene, across studies and data domains. Permit search of Test Article by use and class.<br /><br /><strong>2.8 Link-out<br />Current issue:</strong> CEBS should be a resource to bring users to other external databases.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> CEBS users can be directed to other data resources relating to environmental health science from the CEBS user interface.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Align CEBS with external data resources relating to environmental health science. Develop an API for CEBS to permit it to communicate with other databases containing data relevant to the environmental health sciences at the NIEHS and other ICs. Develop tools to allow the user to navigate from CEBS to government databases of environmental health sciences data and to other public databases to access relevant data. External databases may include CTD, PubChem, ToxNet, AcTOR, DSSTox, SNP databases, PubMed, GEO. Leverage data in PubChem to support structure-based queries via the CEBS user interface.</p>
<p><strong>2.9 Use of Cloud for Production CEBS [Option]<br /></strong>Option: To be exercised at the government's choosing, with at least 6 months' notice.<br /><strong>Current issue:</strong> CEBS runs on the NIEHS network. It is possible that during the course of this contract the decision will be taken at the NIEHS to use the internet cloud to house production CEBS. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Establish a cloud instance of production CEBS which complies with NIEHS/NIH regulations. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> If this were to become a possibility, the Contractor would provide support to prototype and install production CEBS in the cloud, monitor performance and cost, and if a decision were taken to support such an installation for CEBS, provide ongoing system administration, security, and patch management for CEBS cloud installation, with weekly reports and summaries of log files provided for the COR.</p>

<DESC>The purpose for this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is to solicit bid proposals for catered meal services to be delivered to armories located in New Jersey. <br>  <br> The intent of the BPA is to award a contract to that responsible bidder whose bid proposal, conforming to this BPA is most advantageous to the New Jersey Army National Guard (NJARNG), price and other factors considered.  The NJARNG, however, reserves the right to separately procure individual requirements that are the subject of the contract during the contract term, when deemed by the Contracting Officer (KO) to be in the NJARNG's best interest. <br>  <br> The NJARNG has over 30 armories spread throughout New Jersey.  The armory furthest south is located in Cape May Court House.  The armory furthest north is located in Riverdale.  Catered meals could be required in any NJARNG armory on any weekend or week day depending on the unit and its training schedule.  This BPA does not include the Sea Girt National Training Center due to it being under a separate State Contract.   <br>  <br> Normally meals are required for lunches one Saturday and Sunday each month.  The locations that usually required catered meals on a recurring occasion are: Atlantic City, Hammonton, Toms River, Freehold, Lawrenceville, West Trenton, Somerset, Flemington, Woodbridge, Dover, Hackettstown, and Riverdale.  NJARNG does not guarantee which if any armories will require support due to fluctuations in operational tempo and training schedules.  At any time any armory in New Jersey could require catered meal support. <br>  <br> The current average number of catered meals served each month throughout the NJARNG is 1,000.  NJARNG does not guarantee any minimum or maximum number of meals to be served under this contract. <br>  <br> If necessary this contract can be bided on based on regions.  North Region would include Hunterdon, Somerset, Middlesex, Union, Morris, Warren, Essex, Hudson, Sussex, Passaic, and Bergen counties.  South Region would be Mercer, Monmouth, Burlington, Ocean, Camden, Gloucester, Atlantic, Salem, Cumberland, and Cape May counties.  However, it is more advantageous to the NJARNG to bid both regions together.   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<AWDNBR>AG6538P130040
<AWDDATE>021113
<DESC>The purchase and installation of two wet well irrigation motors and pumps is an unusual and compelling emergency for the US Meat Animal Research Center. The US Army Corp of Engineers is engaged in site-wide groundwater cleanup operation mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a result of the operations of the former Blaine Naval Ammunition Depot. This clean up will pump 3,600 gallons of water and discharge the water in USMARC property. Without the installation of these two pumps the water will be discharged and left to run damaging vegetation and also possibly causing additional flows for downstream landowners. The USACE provided the design criteria for these pumps and they provided this information at a very late notice and the criteria require unique, nonstick items that have additional lead time. Significant harm will occur if these pumps are not in place as soon as possible to utilize the treated groundwater. Also, the ongoing drought in the Midwest requires additional water for USMARC operations. New pivot installations have been made as a result of the USACE project and those pivots will have no water without this wet well installation. Greater than $250,000 worth of crops will be at significant risk without the timely installation of this project.

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  

Program Contracting Activity East - St. Louis
VA Medical Center, Bldg. 2
#1 Jefferson Barracks, Drive
St. Louis, MO  63125
777-12-4-6192-0331

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

EES Media Services plans to request for a new requirement using FY 12 funding  by means of other than full and open competition for a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  The proposed awardee is Tektronix. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

EES Media Services requires factory service to repair a Tektronix WFM 7120. Tektronix built this unit which is used in studio productions for live and to tape programing.  The repair and maintenance, includes all parts and labor necessary to return the products to the original published specifications

The estimated cost of this proposed acquisition is $ 3,475.00.  This is a Onetime service contract.


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( ? )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1 (ii)  
	
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

a. Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1 (ii)
 
Tektronix built the equipment and are the only authorized vendors that could be located to provide the required service to get the equipment back to the original published specifications.

 To replace this with another unit from a different vendor would mean we would have to replace the equipment. This would be a very cost prohibitive as new piece of equipment would cost $11,900. The cost difference of $8425.00 for the repairing of the existing unit compared to buying new equipment cannot be recovered through competition. 
 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Tektronix was the only vendor found that could provide the required services.  The acquisition will not be synopsized in FedBizOpps as it is less than $25K.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The price offer to the government is same price offered to the commercial marketplace.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

A search of Google, GSA, SBA and VetBiz was conducted for small business concerns. Numerous vendors were contacted from GSA and VetBiz and none were able to provide required services. The market research concluded that vendor is the only authorized repair shop for this equipment. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 The costs and time associated for reproducing the system using other vendor equipment are cost and time prohibitive. Thus, this contract is needed to maintain an essential capability that supports education programs for EES Media Services.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
None 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required

None as this is a factory repair. 
















12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
