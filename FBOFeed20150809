<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: ">This process will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisitions procedures as stated in FAR Part 13 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt for the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is </span>334516, and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: ">Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. The product shall be delivered within 30 days, from award of the contract.</span></p>
<p>The Radiation Oncology Branch of the CCR (ROB) treats cancer patients with radiation according to approved clinical protocols and performs research to better understand the role of radiation in the treatment of disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>he Radiation Oncology Branch acquired a Nucletron MicroSelectron v.2 High Dose-Rate (HDR) afterloader in 2002 to support branch therapy programs. This device utilizes a radioactive source (Ir-192) on the end of a wire, which can be accurately positioned and indexed to deliver an optimum dose distribution, in which the device was upgraded to a fully digital v.3 in 2014. The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>MicroSelectron is used in the treatment of gynecological malignancies via specialized applicators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, for cancer of the cervix, ROB use's a CT/MR compatible tandem and ovoid set (T+O).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current Elekta (Nucletron) T+O set used by ROB has been in use since 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently the plastic has begun to become brittle and subject to breakage due to repeated sterilization (heat) as well as cumulative radiation damage.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Radiation Oncology Branch of the CCR requires a replacement. The replacement part chosen is a tandem and ring applicator<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(T+R).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a modern design which makes optimum use of the stepping source technology of the HDR, also less manual adjustment of the applicator is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The T+R applicator uses only 2 treatment channels, versus 3 for the T+O and the new CT/MR design also allows for additional interstitial treatment channels along the periphery of the ring to provide a boost for asymmetric disease.</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">Thus, the </span>ROB of the CCR, on a sole source basis plans to procure an Interstitial Ring CT/MR Applicator Set <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">from </span>Elekta Incorporated. The Interstitial Ring CT/MR Applicator Set is compatible with the Government-owned Elekta MicroSelectron v.3 HDR afterloader which is used to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>support its clinical gynecological brachytherapy program. This is the only applicator that is fully compatible with both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR), due to its plastic and carbon fiber construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is also the only applicator that provides an additional, integral template for the insertion of up to 7 additional MR compatible needles that can be locked in place for treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Elekta Inc. (which acquired Nucletron in 2012) is the sole manufacturer of the Government-owned MixcroSelectron HDR afterloader used by ROB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ekekta is the sole manufacturer of the Interstitial Ring CT/MR.

The concept that underlies basic research is that cancer is a genetic disease caused by genetic instability. Thus, the GB of the CCR at the National Cancer Institute is engaged in the study of cancer genetics. Investigating genetics alteration and its effect on the development and biology of cancer is an integral function of the Genetics Branch. By using ultra-high throughput methods, in conjunction with next generation sequencing NCI will be able to reveal aspects of cancer biology not possible using more conventional methods<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">. </strong>Preparation of strand-specific Illumina RNA-Seq libraries is a highly demanding process that currently requires excessive hands on time and is prone to human error. Additionally, when libraries are prepared manually, it is incredibly challenging to normalize the concentration across a set of libraries so that they may be pooled and run in parallel yielding sufficient data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>NIDDK must retire (2) current scintillation counters because their manufacturer has announced that it will no longer offer technical support for them. The work of NIDDK  requires extremely precise measurements of radioactivity in liquids with very low activity. The Tri-Carb 4810TR Scintillation Counter is uniquely qualified to meet our specialized needs because of its patented TR-LSC&reg; (Time-Resolved Liquid Scintillation Counting) system. The innovative TR-LSC lowers the instrument's background levels when counting low activity samples. This is accomplished by use of an "after pulse" analysis that will enable us to more aggressively categorize whether the count originated from within the sample, or was due to some external event. By lowering the backgrounds, we can effect a greater level of sensitivity, lowering the MDA of the instrument. No other scintillation counter offers this technology which is vital to the work that we perform.</p>
<p><br />The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 344516 with a size standard of 500.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, hereby announces its intent to solicit and enter into a contract with Rustici Software, 3351 Aspen Grove Drive, Ste. 300, Franklin, TN 37067-2837 for the purchase of SCORMengine 1.2 LMS/TinCan xAPI Software and Custom Reporting Tool.</p>
<p><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The NAICS code for this acquisition is 511210, Software Publishers, and the small business size standard is $25,000,000.00. Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, per FAR Part 13.5.</p>
<p><br />Rustici's SCORMengine and TinCan xAPI is the only product on the market that will allow CDC to capture all keystrokes, mouse clicks and other internal course information required to develop assessment tools for application-based learning objectives and laboratory competencies. These assessments are essential to documenting agency compliance with biosafety and biosafety training regulations and addressing some of the issues that lead to the recent biosafety incidents reported by the press. Rustici's SCORMengine and TinCan xAPI is also the only product on the market that will allow CDC to distribute SCORM-compliant eLearning materials to external Learning Management Systems (LMS) without distributing source materials, thereby allowing CDC to maintain control over training content. Rustici also is the only vendor that offers customized reporting tools for the TinCan data that CDC will receive when embedding it in the eLearning content. By receiving this enhanced eLearning reporting data, CDC will be able to more accurately evaluate eLearning effectiveness and user compliance with Lab Safety training.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties who feel they possess the expertise, experience and ability should submit a capabilities statement to Tonya S. Justice, Contract Specialist, via email to TJustice@cdc.gov by 1:00 pm EST on 8/24/2015, and reference #2015-85021 in the email subject line. Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p><br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services.</p>
<p><br />The Government shall consider all responses received within fifteen (15) days of this posting, in accordance with FAR 5.203. If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days, negotiations will be conducted with Rustici Software as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/ solicitation number remains the same: N02RC52682-83. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 20) 05-72, (January 2014) Simplified Procedures for a Commercial Item. <br /><br />The Government contemplates only one award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541711 and the Business Size Standard is 500. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has a dual function at the NIH. Investigators in the Branch are involved in the conduct of laboratory and clinical research aimed at improving the care, management, and outcome of patients with cancer. Important areas of laboratory research include tumor immunology, immunotherapy and gene therapy of solid tumors, epigenetic changes in pulmonary malignancies, tumor stem cells, and molecular changes in breast carcinogenesis. In these studies, an emphasis is placed on the translation of laboratory findings into the development of clinical protocols. Clinical efforts emphasize the development of new approaches to the immunotherapy of cancer, to the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of solid tumors, as well as the development of innovative surgical and adjunctive approaches to the treatment of patients with primary and metastatic cancer. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">T cells express a T cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface that determines their specificity. A TCR is created by selecting and splicing together a single V, D and J segment from a collection of available genomic segments. At the junctions between V-D and D-J segments, a varying number of nucleotides are deleted and a special enzyme inserts random nucleotides, creating a unique TCR. It is these inserted nucleotides that are responsible for the vast diversity found in the human TCR repertoire. T cell receptor immune-profiling can be used to monitor T cell responses to a given immune challenge even without the knowledge of the specific epitope targeted. NCI is particularly interested in performing TCR sequencing from T cell populations isolated from human tumor samples. In the tumors, T cells are exposed to tumor antigens, and the frequency of a specific TCR clonotype could be indicative of its ability to recognize the tumor. Thus, the study of the intratumoral T cell repertoire may lead to novel ways to rapidly identify and isolate TCRs that can be used to treat patients with cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology necessary to sequence the hypervariable region of the TCR involves a multiplex PCR with a mixture of primers targeting the rearranged variable and joining segments to capture receptor diversity. Differential hybridization kinetics can introduce significant amplification biases that alter the composition of sequence libraries and potentially biasing the data obtained. Thus, the purpose </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>of this acquisition is to purchase 40,000 input genomes, and 200,000 TCR sequences for 600 DNA Extractions<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and 600 immunoSEQ hs TCRB service (survey).</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span></p>
