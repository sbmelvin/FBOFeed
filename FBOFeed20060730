Any such documentation must be submitted by 11 Aug 2006 at 10:00 AM EST. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order amongst SDVOSB's based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive SDVOSB procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The applicable NAICS code is 423690.  Interested SDVOSB's who believe they are capable of providing the required equipment should submit their technical documentation Ms. Barbara Bowles (910) 432-8598, via email at bowlesb@soc.mil.  A firm-fixed price commercial purchase order will be awarded on 14 Aug 2006.
