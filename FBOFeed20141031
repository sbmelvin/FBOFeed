Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for research and analysis of ground and water surface radiometric measurements and water samples for analysis for harmful algal content. <P> NASA Glenn Research Center is developing the method of using the hyperspectral imager on an aircraft to take images of bodies of water to monitor and study the development of harmful algal blooms. This activity has intensified since the Ohio State of Emergency declared by the governor because 400,000 citizens were without municipal water in the City of Toledo due to the HAB in Lake Erie. But NASAs hyperspectral image data requires calibration, and the calibration information must be acquired on land and over water. <P> AmericaView has collected the samples for analysis for harmful algal content in late spring.  They helped define the protocols and standardized methods and specifications of measurement such as resolutions, sample size, orientation, distance to target, other spatial characteristics, etc. <P> NASA/GRC is going to continue this research with AmericaView, 6702 Caneel Court, Springfield, VA  22152-3029.  This vendor is funded by a grant from the U.S. Geological Survey, and is comprised of university-led, state-based consortia working together to sustain a network of state and local remote sensing scientists, educators, analysts, and technicians. <P> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures put forth in FAR Part 13. <P> The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR reference 13.106-1(b)1. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

4.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.

<DESC>The solicitation is for the Naval Medical Research Unit Cambodia Operations Support Contract (NMRCOSC) within Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  The solicitation will be advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. The North American industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 561210 and the annual size standard is $35,500,000.  The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  The anticipated operations services to be performed include, but are not limited to, Management and Administration, Command and Staff, Security Operations, Facility Support, and Utilities.

This is a new requirement. Currently this requirement is being satisfied by the US Embassy where NAMRU-II is sharing a facility with the US Embassy.
 However a new facility is needed for potential additional specialty freezers.

The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a twelve-month base period (to include a four-month mobilization/phase-in period), seven (7) 12-month option periods, with an integrated one-month demobilization/phase-out period. The Government will not issue a synopsis when exercising the option(s).  

Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation, and any attachments, at http://fbo.gov/ when it becomes available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation, which shall be considered.  

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.
  Award of a contract shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal provides a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. The Offerors price proposal including all option periods will be evaluated on completeness and price reasonableness. The anticipated technical evaluation factors are as follows:  (1) Past Performance; (2) Technical Approach/Methods; and (3) Staffing and Resources.  The Government intends to award the contract without discussions in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary to obtain the best value for the Government. 

The solicitation will be issued on or about 15 days from the date of this notice.
  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fbo.gov/ on or about 17 November 2014.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  Paper copies of the solicitation, amendments, drawings and maps will not be provided.  IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Once the RFP has been posted, all technical/contractual questions must be submitted in writing to:  NFPACQ23-Box1@navy.mil.  In the email, please clearly indicate your company name, section and paragraph number of the RFP or specification and the drawing number, as applicable.
  

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  Previously, offerors were required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and have an active registration in CCR prior to completing their Reps and Certs (Section K of the RFP) in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to award of a contract.  Offerors are now required to complete their registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database via the website https://www.sam.gov. If the offeror previously had an active CCR/ORCA account the offerors information has automatically been incorporated into the SAM database. Offerors are strongly recommended to review their information in SAM to be current and up to date.
 Failure to register in SAM makes an offeror ineligible for award of DoD contracts.  

A pre-proposal conference/site visit is projected to occur during the week of 14 December 2014 in Cambodia.  The exact dates and location of the pre-proposal conference/site visit will be provided in the RFP. Parties interested in attending the pre-proposal conference/site visit MUST PRE-REGISTER by submitting a request via email to NFPACQ23-Box1@navy.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on 18 November 2014.  Due to logistical considerations, a maximum of two (2) representatives will be allowed per firm. Attendees are responsible for their own travel arrangements.  Failure to submit all required information by 18 November 2014, at 4:00 p.m.
 HST will preclude a firms eligibility to participate in the pre-proposal conference and site visit. 

Each pre-proposal conference/site-visit request must include the following information: full name of attendee(s), name of firm represented by attendee(s) and, position/title, telephone number and e-mail address of attendee(s). Request needs to note if the representative will be attending the pre-proposal conference, site visit or both. The Government may request additional information for site visit attendees if required, which will be requested prior to pre-proposal conference/site-visit.  Additional information will be provided to the registered conference/site visit attendees.

The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the government to award a contract, nor to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice.
 This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose.

BACKGROUND
General Project Description
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to provide excellent healthcare services to veterans of the United States. The National Acquisition Centers, National Contracting Division, Contracting Office (NAC) is seeking competitive proposals from prospective contractors to provide, install and implement a turnkey VISN 11 Cardiology Information PACS System solution. This will be a straight purchase acquisition.  Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) have been acquired and implemented in various configurations within VHA.  It is beneficial to establish a standardized VISN-wide PACS with a common interface standard in order to, at a minimum, facilitate the care of patients referred amongst facilities within VISN 11, to ensure interface compatibility with the Veterans Health Information and Technology Architecture (VistA) and to share technical equipment expertise within VISN 11 straight purchase systems.
The adoption of PACS in VHA is now nearly universal. PACS speeds health care decisions by making images available anywhere in the medical facility as soon as the image is acquired.
PACS were initially acquired as independent systems at each Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center.  The process of transferring a study from one independent VA medical center PACS to another is laborious. It requires an order for the study to be placed at the second medical center, which results in duplicate medical record entry.  More recently PACS have been acquired as a single system for the entire VISN.  In this configuration, images are automatically shared across the VISN eliminating the need for an order to be placed in multiple VistA systems.  In order to ensure this multi-facility interoperability, an enhanced HL7 interface has been developed.  This interface improves on the older interface by ensuring that truly unique case numbers and study instances are generated by VistA.  Unique identification is necessary to ensure compliance with the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard and is necessary when VISN 11 decides to transmit all studies to a Vendor Neutral and/or national archive. 
Competition for this RFQ shall be restricted to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Digital Imaging Network Picture Archive and Communications Systems (DIN PACS) III contract holders who are awardees as of the due date for receipt of offers. DIN-PACS III awardees may submit a bid, however, the successful offeror must be on the approved HL7 list at the time of the offer due date.  Please use the following link for additional information: https://www.va.gov/IMAGING/HL7.asp. The VA will reject any proposals that are not HL7 approved at the time of the offer due date. The VA will not return such proposals and will dispose of them.


Vendors will be allowed to make site visits for information purposes only. The Government will not be under any obligations at the time of vendors' site visits. Site visit will only be for information, questions, answering, oral presentations, and demo sessions. 
Purpose of Project
Replace disparate Cardiac Catheterization and Echocardiography image management systems with a single, comprehensive VISN 11 Cardiology Information PACS System that provides open access to image interpretation and comparison, image capturing workstations, acquisition, viewing, archiving, and structured reporting regardless of where exams are performed.  This shall include the software application and licenses, relevant hardware, including but not limited to VISN 11 redundant central archive medical device server, local servers, and local workstations, interfaces to medical devices, interfaces to VA's CPRS/ VistA, and interfaces to other systems. The scope of this initiative includes seven Medical Centers within VISN 11.
This project enables VISN 11 to consolidate cardiology studies and patient monitoring sources on a standard computerized format, facilitating multiple data type integration from a diverse range of cardiology modalities and systems.
1.1.1	A migration plan with associated costs and timeline for comprehensive storage of existing digital archives (includes CDs) with verification of data - ability to read and migrate DICOM compatible CDs to a Vendor Neutral Archive without Vendor propriety tags. The total migration capacity of existing systems is approximately 20TB.

1.1.2	The proposed system solution shall provide a single point-of-access to unify data across the cardiac care continuum including:
1.1.2.1.1	Multiple Care Venues - Cardiac specialty hospitals and centers, catheterization and EP laboratories, cardiac ultrasound, ECG, stress and Holter, cardiovascular surgery, emergency departments, cardiologist offices, congestive heart failure and lipid clinics.
1.1.2.1.2	Multiple Imaging Modalities - Cardiac ultrasounds, nuclear medicine, computed tomography, x-ray angiography, magnetic resonance, computed and digital radiography.
1.1.2.1.3	Interface Capabilities - Hemodynamics, pacemaker and ICD systems, patient monitoring devices, infusion devices, laboratory reference labs, ECG units and stress machines. 
How Project Relates To Other Projects
All proposals must be fully compatible with a separate vendor neutral archive.
Where Is Work Being Performed
This proposal calls for the acquisition, installation, training and maintenance and interfacing with several common echo machine manufacturers of all cardiology equipment as well as all Cardiac Catheterization equipment within VISN 11.

<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the procurement of FY15 COMSOL Software License Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 1.3pt 0in 0pt 3.35pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">AFRL in-house researches utilize COMSOL software. The multiphysics analysis software suite represents an essential component of AFRL/RXCA computational nondestructive evaluation (NDE) research activities. The multiphysics modeling environment must provide a capability for simulating complex physics-based models in virtual and realistic aerospace material systems, where coupled electrical-mechanical-acoustic-thermal problems must be solved explicitly. The software must be capable of interfacing with multiple modules to enhance the capabilities of the software to take into consideration, but not limited to, electric, magnetic, thermal, and electromagnetic fields in high and low frequency applications. The software package must be capable of interfacing with multiple programming and/or structural design software, but not limited to: MATLAB, EXCEL, and Solidworks. These environments/languages provide the necessary programming tools and structural design applications are needed to perform enhanced modeling tasks for current USAF applications in advanced aerospace materials. The software package must be capable of interfacing with known materials information libraries in order to properly model structural materials being used in complex structures. </span></p>
<p><br />The Air Force anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded. The Air Force anticipates a twelve-month license. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB),<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 511210, size standard $38,500,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.<br /><br />All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to <a href="mailto:breeana.dixon@us.af.mil">breeana.dixon@us.af.mil</a>. Statements should be submitted no later than 5 NOV 2014 11:59 AM E.T. The Government will endeavor to answer any questions interested parties may have. All questions must be submitted in writing to breeana.dixon@us.af.mil<br /><br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>THE BELOW DESCRIPTION PROVIDES AN INTRODUCTION ONLY; REFER TO THE ATTACHMENT FOR THE FULL ANNOUNCEMENT. <br>  <br> Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) Sources Sought  <br>  <br> This is a request for candidates for the 15.1 NIE, Oct-Nov 2014.  <br>  <br> Key words: NIE, Agile Process <br>  <br> 1. DESCRIPTION <br>  <br> 1.1 The US Army ASA(ALT) System of Systems Engineering and Integration Directorate (hereinafter referred to as SOSE&I) is seeking interested sources with mature solutions to enhance existing network systems capabilities to participate in a Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) event scheduled to occur in October/November 2014 (referred to as NIE 15.1) at Ft. Bliss, TX and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range, NM (WSMR).  The purpose of this notice is to identify emerging capabilities to be evaluated against a set of entrance criteria for an opportunity to participate in a training event prior to the NIE. This Sources Sought seeks solutions with a narrow focus on Specific Identified Gaps in the current and evolving networked equipment solution set.  Functional requirements for these gaps are listed in Paragraph 2. These gaps are: <br>  <br> Gap 13:  Home Station Training and the Integrated Training Environment (technology)  <br>  <br> NOTE: The Army will be conducting a scheduled Network Baseline Assessment during the field events of NIE 15.1.  As a consequence the number and type of new solutions for this event will be restricted to prevent the introduction of non-baseline equipment into the brigade's networked systems. The Army anticipates the early release of a Sources Sought for NIE 15.2 and NIE 16.1 to allow industry additional time to prepare candidate solutions for those events.  <br>  <br> Due to the training nature of the single announced gap for NIE 15.1 not all the usual proposal submission requirements will need to be met.  <br>   <br> 1.2 The NIE is an Army hosted event conducted twice a year. The NIE is approximately two to four weeks long and employs a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) at Fort Bliss, TX.  The goal is to conduct parallel, systems tests of Army programs, evaluate new network technology capabilities, non-network capabilities and emerging in-theater capabilities and concepts. The NIE events will include tactical exercises using current force equipment and emerging networked systems.  <br>  <br> 1.3 This is a Sources Sought announcement. This does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There is no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted or demonstrations provided in response to this Sources Sought announcement. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for any information or demonstrations provided by respondents to this request. This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.  Financial resources will not be provided for participation in the NIE. <br>  <br> 1.4 Sources must understand the entire financial burden of participating in this process to include: submitting a White Paper, briefing, and Training Plan; attending and providing an Oral Presentation at the System Under Evaluation (SUE) Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM); submitting solution candidates for a training event prior to the NIE participating in pre-NIE integration and planning activities and  training soldiers to operate the candidate solution at Fort Bliss, TX and White Sands Missile Range, NM and post-NIE de-installation and recovery activities  will be the sole financial responsibility of the source.  Field Support Representatives must be available to support each of these required events. <br>  <br> 1.5 The Government will provide a venue for an Oral presentation, assessment services and venue for the candidate solution laboratory testing, integration risk reduction venue, host platform and services and access to the NIE site and facilities.  The Government may provide integration support to integrate candidate solutions into military platforms and assist in network integration... <br>  <br> [REFER TO THE ATTACHMENT FOR CONTINUATION OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.] <br>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY REQUEST: <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY for market research and planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation or request for competitive proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this Notice. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted, and the Government will not reimburse respondents for preparation of the response.  Response to this Notice is strictly voluntary and will not affect future ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division is conducting market research to obtain information regarding the capability of companies to manufacture Ebola Zaire Real-Time PCR (EZ rRT-PCR) Assays which includes all the primers, probes, and reaction buffers specifically formulated to definitively identify the Ebola Zaire Virus in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).  <br>  <br> The EZ assay has been authorized for use in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on the ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument, Light Cycler, and the Joint Biological Agent Identification Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) instruments to provide Ebola Zaire virus testing capability to sites that currently perform PCR testing on these instruments. The level of Ebola Zaire virus will be detected via presence in blood from individuals with early systemic infection. The definitive identification of the Ebola Zaire Virus will require additional testing and confirmation procedures in consultation with public health or other authorities for whom reporting is required. <br>  <br>  <br> SPECIFICATIONS: <br>  <br> The Ebola Zaire Assay should include the following Reagents: <br>  <br> 1. EZ1 Master Mix - Contains primer and probe sequences that specifically detect Ebola Zaire in Trizol-inactivated whole blood or Trizol-inactivated plasma specimens.  <br>  <br> 2. RNase P (RP) - Used to detect human RP and is used as a positive control with human clinical specimens to indicate that adequate isolation of nucleic acid resulted from the extraction of the clinical specimen.  <br>  <br> 3. EZ1 Positive Template Control (EZ1-PTC) - This control will be PTC designed to react with the EZ1-PCR reagents to indicate whether the Ebola Zaire PCR reaction worked. This PTC material consists of synthetic template RNA. <br>  <br> 4. RP Positive Template Control (RP-PTC) - Designed to react with the RP rRT-PCR reagents to indicate whether the RP PCR reaction worked. This PTC material consists of synthetic template RNA. The RP-PTC should only be positive for the RP assay.  <br>  <br> 5. RT- Taq Polymerase - This must be the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase sold by Thermo Fisher as it was included in the original EUA submission. <br>  <br> It is imperative that the SuperScript consumable remain as part of the EUA Kit.  As such, to establish an additional PCR production facility, the manufacturer would need to obtain licensing for the intellectual property (IP) associated with SuperScript product which is owned by Roche, Ltd.  Therefore, in order to change the consumable, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires proof of performance through equivalency testing with changed variable. <br>  <br>  <br> SUBMITTALS: <br>  <br> Interested parties shall respond by specifying if they have a current commercially fielded product that expressly meets the parameters listed above.    <br>  <br> Interested Parties shall submit a short summary (no more than 5 pages total) describing their products' capabilities in each of these areas.

<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT WILL NOT RESULT IN A DIRECT GOVERNMENT SOLICITATION. PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY.<br /><br />The National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Polar Programs (PLR) is the agency responsible for managing the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). Through a competitive procurement, Lockheed Martin (LM) won the Antarctic Support Contract (ASC) which provides logistical support to the USAP.
<p>The ASC operates three year-round stations, which include South Pole and McMurdo on the Antarctic continent, and Palmer on Anvers Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. Palmer Station is primarily a marine research facility where a majority of science is accomplished through the use of small watercraft.<br /><br />Through the ASC, NSF is seeking vendors to conduct engineering, fabrication, outfitting, certification/testing and commissioning for two rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB) with aluminum hulls for year-round use at Palmer Station. These craft should have matching hull designs, with the ability to be outfitted in a complementary manner, designed to safely and efficiently handle light oceanographic-sampling gear as well as a matched configuration that combines both search-and-rescue (SAR)/tow capability and passenger movement capacity. The goal is a compact and functional oceanographic platform that is easily maintained in a remote field setting and performs well while in a seaway or while in mixed brash-ice conditions.</p>
<p>The minimum recorded temperature as of 2006 at Palmer Station is -31 degrees Celsius and the maximum 9 degrees Celsius. Storms and precipitation are frequent with approximately 35-50 cm of water equivalent of precipitation received annually in the form of snow and rain. Winds are persistent but generally light to moderate in strength, prevailing from the northeast.</p>
<p>LM intends to solicit firm-fixed-price proposals for the building of these two RHIBs from interested contractors. The solicitation is under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 336612, Boat Building. The small business size standard for this NAICS is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The anticipated solicitation release date is November 14, 2014 with a planned award date by December 19, 2014.</p>
<p>To receive a copy of the solicitation or to submit questions regarding this opportunity, please contact LM's Sonya Reeser at sonya.reeser@lmco.com.</p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for a Stainless Steel (SS) Exposure Modules to hold twelve (12) inserts for 12-well plates.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requires up to two (2) Stainless Steel (SS) Exposure Modules to hold twelve (12) inserts for 12-well plates to serve the tobacco research needs of the NCTR and collaborative research with the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). The modules will be used for exposing the 3D human bronchial airway culture model to tobacco smoke. The project involves exposing Ames test bacteria cultures, and cell cultures used in the Micronucleus (MN) assay, Mouse Lymphoma assay (MLA) and a 3D human airway model to tobacco smoke generated by a Jaeger-Baumgartner 30-port Cigarette Smoking Machine. The exposure modules shall be compatible with the Jaeger-Baumgartner 30-Port Cigarette Smoking Machine. This equipment will be used to conduct the studies outlined above to provide needed data to determine the risks associated with exposure to specific levels of whole tobacco smoke, thus filling in data-gaps that exist in risk assessment models. In addition, the equipment will allow the FDA to be able to quantify the toxicity of whole cigarette smoke, and will provide the FDA/CTP with data regarding the relative toxic and genotoxic potency of tobacco products.</p>
<p>The exposure modules shall be used to validate the whole smoke experiment and optimize the in vitro studies of whole smoke or gas mixtures. The cells will be cultured in 12-well inserts and then get consistent exposure using the exposure modules specified herein.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>The objective of this program is to continue to advance cellular therapy research in the areas of regeneration of damaged/diseased tissues, organs, biologic systems, and targeted treatments for serious diseases without effective therapies. The current segment of the Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) program (2010-2015) includes five Cell Processing Facilitates (CPFs) and one Coordinating Center (CC). The five CPFs provide production assistance in areas ranging from translational development to the scale-up of a product to the manufacture and delivery of clinical grade cellular therapy products for animal safety studies and Phase I/II clinical trials. Applications for product manufacture are received via a web portal and managed by the CC. Applications that are found to be of programmatic interest to the Institute and associated with a funded clinical study are considered for manufacture by the program. In addition, the CPFs and the CC provide education and regulatory support through active assistance with product regulatory materials, cell processing workshops, presentations at scientific meetings, peer reviewed publications, and educational web seminars. For more information on the 2010-2015 PACT programs, see <span><a href="http://www.pactgroup.net/">http</a><a href="http://www.pactgroup.net/"></a><a href="http://www.pactgroup.net/">://www.pactgroup.net/</a>.</span></p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 17, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.

<SOLNBR>HSTS04-15-SN-STD014
<RESPDATE>010115
<CONTACT>Bonnie S Evangelista, Email bonnie.evangelista1@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issues this special notice concerning FBO postings HSTS04-11-R-CT1091 (i), HSTS04-11-R-CT1090 (ii) and HSTS04-09-R-ST2180 (iii) to notify vendors of the process to close the testing window for new entrants into the Explosive Detection System (EDS) Qualified Products List (QPL) until further notice from TSA. During the 2015 through 2017 timeframe, TSA plans to purchase fewer than ten (10) Reduced Size EDS per year, fewer than eighty (80) Medium Speed EDS per year, and fewer than five (5) High Speed EDS per year. <br /><br /><br />All vendors who desire the opportunity to have a Reduced Size, Medium Speed or High Speed EDS added to the current QPL must submit a compliant qualification data package (QDP) to enter into TSA Qualification testing to TSA for review by January 2, 2015. The QDP must be submitted in accordance with the submission requirements listed below, the Qualification Management Plan Version 2.1.2, and DID-001. In the event that the TSA determines the vendor's QDP to be deficient, the vendor will have one opportunity to revise the QDP. The revised QDP must be submitted to TSA within 15 calendar days of receipt of TSA's comments. Vendors that fail to meet these requirements will be removed from consideration under the current QPL.<br /><br /><br />Vendors currently participating in the EDS Competitive Procurement QPL process are subject to the 3rd party testing model (See FBO announcement Solicitation number: HSTS04-14-OSC-3rd_Party_Testing_Model for more information (iv)). Effective July 1, 2014, systems encountering a significant failure during formal TSA Qualification Testing, with the exception of detection testing, will be temporarily suspended from further TSA testing until sufficient data is provided from a third-party test entity attesting the failed requirement(s) have been met. 3rd Party Test (TPT) Data shall be provided no later than 6 months from the date the contractor is notified of the significant failure. A second failure of TSA qualification testing after the acceptance of TPT data and re-test by the Government will result in removal from TSA Qualification Testing.<br /><br /><br />Vendors currently participating in EDS detection certification activities at the Transportation Security Laboratory are reminded that detection standard version 7.2 will become effective January 1, 2015 for EDS; therefore, starting January 1, 2015, all EDS submitted for certification testing must be compliant with the revised detection standard (See FBO announcement Solicitation number HSTS04-14-X-AA14STD114 Update: TSA Explosive Detection System (EDS) Performance Requirements (v)).<br /><br /><br />Questions and QDPs must be submitted to Bonnie Evangelista at Bonnie.Evangelista@tsa.dhs.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to ensure receipt of delivery.

<p>(b) Submission of offers.

<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.<br />As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability<br />Past Performance<br />Price</p>
<p>Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government intends to award one contract to the offeror deemed responsible in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the Request for Quote Proposals (RFQ) requirements including all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by the RFQ and is judged, based on the evaluation criteria, to represent the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award to the offeror who in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall value in response to the requirements.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) Technical Capability. Technical acceptability will be determined by evaluation of the offerors submitted technical documentation/certification of at least five (5) years' work experience. The offeror shall submit a resume in any format but the total pages should be less than three (3) pages, front and back. To be considered technically acceptable for this requirement, the resume must contain at a minimum, the following information: <br />1. Minimum of a Bachelor's Degree in Science, Social Science, or Business Management<br />2. Working knowledge of current Microsoft Office Programs (Word, Excel, Power Point, and Outlook)<br />3. Working knowledge of database management.<br />4. Two to Five years' experience in a customer service position<br />5. One year of past experience in test administration.<br />6. Details of previous experience working as a Test Specialist/Proctor for the military and/or educational institutions.<br />7. Experience in the following areas: Trouble shooting/fixing problems with online testing applications (i.e. communications with DANTES client support technicians). Air Force/Military/DoD office procedures and terminology. Public speaking, and or, providing detailed verbal instructions to an audience (cite specific audience size in quantity).</p>
<p>The offeror shall be determined technically acceptable on a pass or fail basis through review of the resume(s) provided. <br /><br />(ii) Price. Offeror must provide Attachment 3, Offer Schedule, completed with their offer pricing. All offers will be ranked by price.</p>
<p>Price proposals conforming to all requirements of this solicitation and including all elements stated in the addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, incorporated into this solicitation will be ranked based on the Total Evaluated Price:</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price = (Total Evaluated Price for Base Period) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 1) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 2) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 3) + (Total Evaluated Price for Option Period 4):</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price for Base Period and Option Periods: Quantities identified on the schedule will be multiplied by the unit price to confirm the extended price and then the extended price for all CLINS will be added together for a total for that specific period:</p>
<p>Unit prices shall be used in the event that extended prices are calculated incorrectly to resolve minor irregularities.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, unit pricing for each option period shall be evaluated for an additional 6 months at the offer price. Offerors shall not submit a price for the possible one-half extension of services for each period of performance. The prices are evaluated IAW the Option to Extend Services for evaluation purposes only and these totals shall not be included in the contract award nor will a CLIN be added. These prices are already determined to have been evaluated at time of contract award within the Total Evaluated Price and will not be independently evaluated.</p>
<p>Prices will be evaluated for completeness, fair, and reasonableness:</p>
<p>(iii) Past Performance. Offeror must provide Attachment 5, Past and Present Performance Questionnaire. The offeror shall provide within their offer documentation their CAGE and DUNS with their offer.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the recency, relevancy and quality of the offerors' provided past performance information, past performance questionnaires received and other past performance information data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>Past Performance will first be evaluated for recency; all performance prior to three years from the date of the solicitation or not yet performed on the date of this solicitation will not be evaluated;</p>
<p>Past Performance will then be evaluated for relevancy and rated as relevant or not relevant; and</p>
<p>Past Performance will be assigned one of the following confidence ratings:</p>
<p>- Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort;</p>
<p>- Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort;</p>
<p>- Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort;</p>
<p>- No Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort; and</p>
<p>- Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned:</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of recent and relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>Performance confidence assessment is an evaluation of the likelihood for the Government's confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the solicitation's requirements based upon the offeror's past performance information.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer has been determined technically acceptable, and is judged to have a Substantial Confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers; and</p>
<p>All prospective contractors must have CAGE codes and DUNS numbers, as well as, be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) website at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ (formerly CCR) to be eligible for award. Processing time for registration in SAM may take five business days or more. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM website or by calling 866-606-8220 or 334-206-7828 for international calls. <br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA), facilitates the marketing of U.S. grain and related agricultural products through the establishment of standards for quality assessments, and regulation of handling practices. GIPSA's Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) administers the official commodity inspection and weighing program under the authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (AMA), as amended. The AMA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to contract with private firms, institutions, and individuals for the purpose of performing specified inspection services. FGIS will use this contracting authority to supplement its workforce by contracting with private companies and individuals to sample, inspect, and weigh commodities when requested by FGIS-Field Management Division.</p>
<p>II. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Contractor must provide processed commodity inspection and weighing services under the authority of the AMA in the geographical area serviced by the FGIS Domestic Inspection Operations Office (DIOO). The area includes commodity plants in Scott City, Missouri.</p>
<p>Work at the plant may include any or all activities in the Processed Commodities Handbook, Weighing Handbook, Condition of Food Container Handbooks, Sanitation Handbook, and applicable Directives. The commodity inspection services that FGIS may assign to the contractor include but are not limited to, the following services:</p>
<p>a. Sampling Service. Drawing a sample from a processed commodity lot using FGIS-approved methods to obtain representative samples for laboratory analysis to determine quality based contract requirements and instructions.</p>
<p>b. Condition of Food Container Inspection. Examining the containers for condition, construction, sealing, and markings using U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers. (Reference: Agricultural Marketing Service, Part 42--Standards for Condition of Food Containers)</p>
<p>c. Checkweighing. Weighing a selected number of containers from a processed commodity lot, determining the estimated total gross, tare, and net weight, or the estimated average gross or net weight per filled container. (Reference: Chapter 4, FGIS Weighing Handbook)</p>
<p>d. Carrier Stowage Examination. Visually determine if a carrier or container is clean; dry; free of infestation, rodents, toxic substances, and foreign odor; and suitable to store or carry a commodity. (Reference: Directive FGIS 9180.48)</p>
<p>e. Checkloading. Performing a stowage examination on a carrier, computing the number of filled containers loaded aboard the carrier, observing the condition of containers loaded aboard the carrier, and sealing the loaded carrier, if practicable. (Reference: Directive FGIS 9180.50)</p>
<p>The number and kind of work activities at each plant may expand or be reduced during the contract period based on requests FGIS-Field Management Division (FMD) receives from interested parties involved in purchasing and producing product and FGIS-FMD's performance assessment of the contractor.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

<p>c. Not send sensitive PII to any person who does not have an official need for such information; and</p>
<p>d.

The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

Genuine Genius Technologies, LLC is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirement due to the unique nature of the Xvoucher platform. No other source has been identified to be compatible with this system.

<CONTACT>Jennifer Parker, Chief of Concessions, Intermoutain Region, NPS, Phone (303) 969-2661, Fax (303) 969-2786, Email jennifer_parker@nps.gov
<DESC><p>The deadline for proposals has been extended to Wednesday, November 19, 2014. Any proposal, including that of the Existing Concessioner, must be received by the Chief of Concessions, Intermountain Region, National Park Service, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228 by 4:00 p.m. MST on Wednesday, November 19, 2014 in order to be evaluated and considered for award of the Concession Contract.</p>
<p>Temporary Contract</p>
<p>The National Park Service recognizes that insufficient time remains to receive proposals responding to the Solicitation, evaluate those proposals, select the best proposal, have the selected entity sign the contract incorporating the terms of that proposal, and comply with the required 60-day Congressional notice period prior to the expiration of the Existing Contract. The Service, therefore, intends to enter into a temporary concession contract pursuant to 16 U.S.C. &sect; 5952(11)(A) and 36 C.F.R. &sect; 51.24 having a term not to exceed one year to avoid an interruption of visitor services for the operations under the Draft Contract as set out in the Prospectus. The Service believes the temporary contract could cover a period as short as 60-120 days to accommodate the expiration of the Existing Contract and transition to a new concessions contract. The National Park Service does not need to solicit proposals for temporary concessions contracts.</p>
<p>Background Regarding Minimum Franchise Fee</p>
<p>Solicitation # CC-GRCA001-15B is the third prospectus the National Park Service has issued to seek proposals to replace the Existing Contract. The Service has considered questions and comments from interested entities, including the Existing Concessioner, and has responded to those comments and concerns by designing a business opportunity that recognizes the tremendous commercial potential of the operations under the Draft Contract, provides a prudent operator an opportunity for a profit based on the requirements of the Draft Contract, and retains for the benefit of the American taxpayers a reasonable franchise fee. The terms of the Draft Contract, including the required visitor services, the assignment of Concession Facilities, the financial projections, and the franchise fee for the government reflect the professional input and advice not only of experts within the National Park Service, but also of an independent hospitality expert.</p>
<p>When determining a minimum franchise fee for a new concession contract that will provide concessioners the statutorily-required reasonable opportunity for a net profit, the National Park Service assumes all interested offerors have to make the same initial investment. The National Park Service does not differentiate between an incumbent concessioner and an operator that would have to expend working capital to hire new personnel, invest in personal property that the incumbent already would own, and/or purchase Leasehold Surrender Interest from the incumbent. In this case, the Existing Concessioner holds approximately $58 million in Leasehold Surrender Interest.</p>
<p>Housing Allocation between CC-GRCA001-15 and CC-GRCA003-15</p>
<p>The Existing Concessioner has raised concerns about the allocation of employee housing between the Draft Contract and the pending concession contract CC-GRCA003-15. The National Park Service and its hospitality consultant carefully and thoroughly analyzed the operations under each contract and, using the consultant's expertise and experience, identified the staffing needs of prudent operators under each proposed contract. The analysis recognized that a number of Concession Facilities and associated services would be allocated from the 001 contract to the 003 contract, so that the concessioner under the 001 Draft Contract would need fewer employees than does the Existing Concessioner under the Existing Contract. The National Park Service then reasonably allocated housing based on those projected staffing needs. Moreover, the National Park Service does not guarantee concessioners sufficient housing for all their employees within a park.</p>
<p>As explained in the Prospectus, in this case, the National Park Service specifically recognized that the Concessioner under the Draft Contract may need to pay some employees higher wages to find housing outside the Park and, consequently, factored into its calculations an assumption that the Concessioner would pay approximately $500,000 each year in additional salaries. Under the original prospectus for GRCA001-15, the National Park Service also agreed to convert 28 historic cabins that would have been available for visitor accommodations to use as additional employee housing and incorporated that change in the current prospectus. In addition, the National Park Service agreed that 28 other cabins currently used as employee housing may be winterized for year-round use. The National Park Service further agreed to assign additional housing facilities on a short-term basis to assist with issues that may arise during the first year of operation. In addition, the National Park Service stated that it would be willing to re-allocate employee housing after the award of both contracts if the selected concessioners so request. Finally, the selected offeror for CC-GRCA003-15 has agreed that it will allow any employee under the Existing Contract who occupies her or his own trailer within the Trailer Village to remain there for the first year of the Draft Contract. The National Park Service believes these steps adequately address potential employee housing concerns for the concession operations under the Draft Contract.</p>

The Concessioner will be allowed to increase all lodging rates from the currently approved rates, at not less than the rate of inflation (i.e., Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers averaged over the prior 12 months) for the first three years of the Contract. The Concessioner must submit a rate approval request and provide justification for any increase requested above CPI. If an increase above CPI is requested, the Service will conduct a rate review based on Comparability. After the first three years of the Contract, lodging rates will be determined using Comparability.<br />(b) Food and Beverage.

Specific project components include the following items and incidental related work: <br>  <br> The remaining portion of the Project Access Road from the termination of the portions of the road built by others. <br>  <br> A reservoir (D-400) comprised of approximately 50,000 linear feet of earthen embankment with a soil cement crest surface and soil cement facing on the interior embankment face. Additional embankment components include an internal inclined sand chimney drain and horizontal blanket drain with pipes running parallel to the embankment with discharge points draining to a swale, and a 3-feet wide trench drain of sand and drain pipes running parallel to the downstream toe of the embankment. The approximately 3,400 acre reservoir has a normal full storage level of 15 feet (EL 41 feet <br> NAVD88) and provides approximately 50,600 acre-feet of storage capacity. <br>  <br> A reservoir discharge tower structure (S-402) comprised of three (3) 7 feet by 7 feet slide gates to convey a maximum of 1,100 cubic feet per Second (cfs) (600 cfs under normal operations) through two 7 feet by 7 feet cast-in-place box culverts (with operable slide gates) to the system discharge canal. The structure also includes a service spillway capable of conveying 810 cfs for emergency discharges and a 50 cfs low reservoir stage withdrawal pump. <br>  <br> The Western Reservoir Perimeter Canal (WRPC) (C-400W) is approximately 35,000 linear feet in length, paralleling most of the northern, western, and southern extent of the reservoir embankment. The WRPC maintains a bottom width of 5 feet for a majority of the canal with a transition from 5 feet to 25 feet along the south side of the reservoir. The canal bottom is constant at EL 12.0 foot NAVD88 for the majority of the canal. The canal includes a 1.5 ft thick sand filter below normal water level along the side slopes and bottom of the canal. The WRPC will be used to transmit surface runoff, seepage flow from the embankment internal drain and the trench drain systems. <br>  <br> WRPC spillway (S-403) is a 50 foot wide spillway which discharges to the intake canal with a crest elevation of 18 feet NAVD88 and a 1,100 cfs capacity. <br> The Eastern Reservoir Perimeter canal (ERPC) (C-400E) approximately 15,000 linear feet in length paralleling the eastern embankment of the reservoir.  The canal maintains a bottom width of 5 feet at an elevation of 12 feet NAVD88. The canal includes a 1.5 ft thick sand filter below normal water level along the side slopes and bottom of the canal. The ERPC is designed to convey runoff and seepage from the embankment internal drain and the trench drain system. The termination of the ERPC includes a drop-inlet drainage structure (S-419) to convey water from the ERPC to the Intake Canal. <br>  <br> The discharge canal conveys flows from the reservoir through the Distribution Canal (C-401N and C-401S) to the Eastern Storm Treatment Area (STA) Collection Canal (C-402E); note; only a portion of this canal will be built as part of this contract, which will be connected to a portion being constructed by others. The canal maintains a bottom width of 10 feet, a bottom elevation of 18.5 feet NAVD88, and a normal operating elevation of 28-29 feet NAVD88 with a design conveyance capacity of 1,100 cfs.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The USNS SUPPLY is currently in BAE Southeast's shipyard undergoing replacement of its Machinery Control System (MCS). The ship's new MCS will not be completely installed and tested by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) within BAE's original contract period of performance which ends 01 November 2014 (which includes a 15-day extension after exercise of a contract option). The OEM has stated that it will now take until 15 March 2015 to complete the MCS installation, which will be followed by dock and sea trial testing that will conservatively require an additional two weeks. Without an operational MCS, the ship cannot operate under its own power. It is impractical, costly, and risky to move the ship to another shipyard as doing so will require the ship to be towed. Changing shipyards would further delay and disrupt installation of the new MCS. Therefore, the current shipyard contract must be extended to ensure continuation of services until the MCS is installed and tested. The subject contract with BAE calls for the shipyard to conduct tests of the fully operational MCS system, which could take up to two weeks. Therefore, the continuation of services should account for this time period and extend until 31 March 2014.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 20, for the Puget Sound VA Medical Center

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
This is a request for Other than Full and Open Competition to enter into a new firm fixed price contract with Roche Diagnostics for on-site, full service maintenance and repair to ensure that the Benchmark Ultra Blood Stainers are kept in proper operating condition and ready for clinical testing. 

In accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
Purchase Request 663-15-1-213-0008 funds on-site, full service maintenance and repair to Benchmark Ultra Stainer Modules SN 312323 and 312324 located at the Puget Sound VA Medical Center. The equipment must be kept in proper operating condition and ready for clinical testing. This requirement includes all parts and service to properly provide preventative maintenance, diagnostics, phone support, on-site repairs, and software updates to ensure that all units are fully operational according to manufacturer specifications prior to departure.

The estimated value of the base year is $32,590.00. The estimated total contract value is $180,080.32 for a base and four option years contract. Estimated Period of Performance for the base year is December 1, 2014 through November 30, 2015.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  The statutory authority for restricting competition is Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and is implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(2):

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
Roche Diagnostics is the manufacturer of the Benchmark Ultra Stainer. Roche Diagnostics holds all licenses to the software and the unique ability and knowledge to support the Benchmark Ultra Stainers.
Per a proprietary letter from Michelle Noles of Roche Diagnostics, all maintenance of the equipment and any servicing must be performed by factory-trained engineers of Roche Diagnostics. This equipment is specialized and only the manufacturer is authorized to maintain the equipment.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
The contract specialist posted a special notice on FBO to publicize the VA's intent to solicit from a single source. The notice was available on October 31, 2014.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The Independent Government Cost estimate anticipates the cost to the government to be $180,080.32 for a base and four option years, however a quote provided by the Contractor on 10/17/2014 stated the actual contract price would be $171,076.30. Price reasonableness is based on a comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases of similar requirements.  VA260-14-F-1588 was awarded on February 24, 2014, for service on similar equipment, with a total contract value of $174,584.79. VA260-14-F-1588 and the current requirement both require full service maintenance on two pieces of blood analyzing equipment. Additionally, the Contractor's quote was very comparable to the Independent Government Estimate of $180,080.32. If the Government was to forgo a preventative maintenance contract, individual repairs, parts and maintenance of the equipment could be higher than the yearly cost of the service agreement. The cost to the Government is considered fair and reasonable based on a comparison of prices found reasonable on previous purchases. 


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
a)	No agency inventories have been identified that have this requirement on hand.
b)	A search for "Stainers" did not return any results through UNICOR.
c)	A search for "Stainers" proved Ability One is not able to provide this requirement at this time.
d)	GSA Advantage! did not located vendors that could provide the service. Roche Diagnostics does have a GSA contract however services are not included on the contract.
e)	A small business search under NAICS code 811219 returned 3,362 results. However, after narrowing the search to include Key Word "Stainer", the search returned no results. 
f)	A VetBiz search under NAICS 811219 and Key Word "Stainer" returned zero Veteran-Owned Small businesses. 
g)	Michelle Noles of Roche Diagnostics provided a sole source letter on October 13, 2014, indicating that Roche Diagnostics' factory trained technicians are the only ones certified to perform maintenance and repair for the Ventana/Roche Systems. 



9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
No other facts beyond what have been described above are available to support restricting competition.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
No vendors have expressed interest in writing at this time.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
Before awarding any subsequent actions, market research will be conducted to determine if outside vendors are then able to provide the required service.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

However, an ordering activity must justify its action<br />when restricting consideration in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section-<br />(a) Orders or BPAs exceeding the micro-purchase threshold based on a limited sources<br />justification.<br />(1) Circumstances justifying limiting the source.<br />(i) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the micropurchase<br />threshold not placed or established in accordance with the procedures in<br />8.405-1, 8.405-2, or 8.405-3, the only circumstances that may justify the action<br />are-<br />(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services<br />required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services<br />are unique or highly specialized;<br />1. The Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />This requirement is for the purchase of eight (8) Mobile Defensive Fighting Position (MDFP)<br />Shields and casters. The MDFP Shields shall be designed with at least Level IV ballistic<br />coverage to protect Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) officers in locations where the<br />highest level of threat exists, to include terrorist activity and the use of armor piercing<br />ammunition<br />2.
