*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Inductively Coupled Plasma  Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). ***

Background:  

The Materials and Construction Research Division (MCRD) within the Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) performs research on the chemical and physical properties of infrastructural materials.  Material characterization techniques are needed to determine the elemental composition of aqueous solutions that are in thermodynamic equilibrium with various infrastructural materials.  

The study of infrastructural materials involves a number of complexities:  Corrosion of steel elements within infrastructural materials is a major national problem, so the instrumentation must be capable of detecting halogens.  For some studies, the quantity of solution extraction is very small, so the instrumentation must be able to obtain the entire emission spectrum with relatively few images.  Infrastructural materials are large-volume commodity products having a large number of elements, so optical properties and spectral resolution are important.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: One (1) Inductively Coupled Plasma  Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometer (Halogen capable):

If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offerors FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are more important than price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements.

The primary specifications stated in the specifications document are minimum specifications.  A quoted system must meet or exceed all of those to be considered for award.

As noted in the specifications, stronger consideration will be given to a system that meets the following secondary specifications:

6.	Truly simultaneous measurement of all wavelengths of interest, regardless of wavelengths or intensities (if CCD, capability for user to force simultaneity through software setting)
7.	Spectrometer purging system that does not require a continuous supply of gas (e.g., recirculating system)
8.	Software selectable dual-view (axial and radial)
9.	Support for qualitative analysis to identify unknown sample components
10.	Software aids for identifying potential spectral interferences using NIST and/or other recognized wavelength databases
11.	Optical (FWHM) resolution better than 8.5 pm at 200 nm
12.	Capability to vary optical resolution by changing slit widths or other means
13.	Automatic scheduled startup and plasma ignition
14.	Inclusion of software upgrades for at least 5 years at no additional cost to the Government
15.	Uninterrupable power supply (UPS) sufficient to maintain full electrical power to spectrometer for no less than 3 minutes upon total loss of electrical power.

A quoted system that fails to meet the secondary specifications will not be deemed technically unacceptable.  

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Dix Corporation, W912BV-10-C-1013<br><br>As part of Operations and Maintenance Army, Recovery Act, this modification is issued to Dix Corporation to perform the following work: The drum will be removed from the crane and shipped to the shop for repairs and further inspections.  The gear will be removed and both drum ends will be cut out from the drum shell.  Once the drum ends have been removed the inside of the drum shell will be NDT inspected for cracks where the diaphragms were attached.  If no further cracks are found new designed double diaphragms with shaft assembly will be installed and welded into the drum ends and the government will receive a credit back for the replacemnet cost of the drum.  If cracks are found on the drum shell, a complete replacement of the drum will be necessary.  For replacement, a new drum will be fabricated and machined in the shop to the original drum shell specifications with new designed double diaphragms and shaft assembly installed.  The hoist pinion gear will be removed from the reducer with the pinion shaft and shipped to the shop on the shaft for inspection.  The bull gear will be removed from the crane with the drum and shipped to the shop on the drum.   Both the pinion and bull gears will be thoroughly inspected in the shop and a report will be submitted to determine if the gears can be reused by flipping around, or would need to be replaced completely.  If re-used, the gears will be completely cleaned of all old grease and rust.  The pinion will be pulled from the pinion shaft, turned around 180 degrees, and pressed back on to the shaft.  The bull gear will be pulled from the drum, turned around 180 degrees, and pressed back onto the drum and the government will receive a credit for the replacement cost of the gears.  If new gears are necessary, then new gears will be manufactured like existing, with the gear manufactures recommended material and hardness for this application.  The new pinion gear will be pressed onto the shaft in the shop, and then shipped to site for installation.  The new bull gear will be pressed onto the drum in the shop, and shipped back to site for installation.  Once the pinion shaft and drum are re-installed on the crane, the gears will need to be re-aligned to the manufactures recommendations.  A testing of the gear alignment will also be conducted during load testing under full load.  <BR>
