<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 and Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number DG133R-05-RP-1183 is issued as a request for proposals and is solicited under full and open competition. The NAICS Code is 541330. 

The DOC/NOAA, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) is seeking research and design  engineering and fabrication services for the NOAA scientific Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) system for installation on the NOAA vessel(formerly known as the U.S.N.S. Capable.)  This requires the design, fabrication and installation of the ROV.  The government has budgeted $3,000,000.00 for 24 months.

The ROV design characteristics should support scientific missions of exploration and research similar to those already undertaken by NOAA/OAR.

The project area is located in T.9N, R.3W., P.M.M., Sections 31, 32 and 33 - Jefferson County, Montana, near the town of Clancy, Montana. A Site Visit has been scheduled for Tuesday, October 18, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. Participants will meet at:  Legal Tender Restaurant Parking Lot just off Interstate 15 west of the Clancy off ramp.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract for the development and implementation of the National Biosafety and Biocontainment Training Program (NBBTP). The NBBTP provides post-graduate professional training in biosafety and biocontainment of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease agents and agents that may be used intentionally to cause public health or economic harm.  The NBBTP was established specifically to support the United States civilian biodefense research initiative by providing highly trained and qualified biosafety professionals to oversee and manage the conduct of research with these agents.  NBBTP provides two-year training fellowships to meet this critical need. The following tasks are to be included under this requirement: 1). Develop a working model of the program; 2). Develop a comprehensive curriculum organized around the central concepts of biosafety and high-level biocontainment; 3). Implement a training and education paradigm that will provide the training and education necessary for biosafety professionals to manage and operate high level biocontainment laboratories;  4). Develop and implement an administrative structure and organization; and, 5). Develop and implement a program oversight and evaluation strategy to ensure the highest levels of training and performance. Services will be procured on a sole source basis from the Frontline Healthcare Workers Safety Foundation, a not-for-profit educational foundation. The Frontline Healthcare Workers Foundation is the only not-for-profit educational and research institution in the United States administering and conducting a professional biosafety and biocontainment training program. Currently, there is no other training resource available in the US that can provide comprehensive, two-year instruction on biosafety practice and the design, operation and management of biocontainment laboratories.  The Foundation is currently providing these services and has developed a curriculum that will be enhanced to meet the NIAID requirements. Their current and previous efforts have provided them with unique abilities and experience to complete this requirement.  The continuance and expansion of the NBBTP is critically needed in support of the national and regional biodefense laboratory network. For these reasons, the Government believes that no other offerors have the capability to provide these services. Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed to Michele DiNatale at (301) 402-5644 or dinatalem@niaid.nih.gov before the synopsis closing date of September 12, 2005. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is seeking to identify all responsible sources capable of providing RFID systems for tracking, locating, and identifying express shipments of medical isotopes.  Firms that have the prerequisite background knowledge, experience, and capability to be able to successfully meet or exceed the requirements described herein are invited to participate in a two phase demonstration of their technology.  This is not a request for bids, but an invitation to participate in a demonstration that is targeted to lead to the deployment of an operational system to track and monitor radiological sources in commerce.  Vendors must provide full product line literature and available documentation of equipment and interfaces for their proposed products.  Vendors must also provide product line samples as appropriate and requested.  All expenses related to literature reproduction and dissemination; provision of product line samples, product line and services demonstrations; demonstration support; marketing; and appropriate in-service education related to the referenced two phase demonstration must be at no charge to the government.  Multiple vendors will be utilized in this demonstration.

ORNL desires to evaluate the use of RFID systems to monitor express air and truck shipments of medical radioisotopes.  Vendors are being sought to provide a solution that will monitor the shipments while in transit using passive, active, or hybrid RFID tags or a combination thereof.  ORNL intends to demonstrate RFID systems, typically consisting of a “tag” and a “reader” component, appropriate for the express air and truck shipping environment.  Result of the demonstration will be published.

USA Department of Transportation (DOT) Type A packages are used for shipping small quantities of medical radioisotopes.  This packaging conforms to condition and limitations specified in 49 CRR 173.4 for radioactive materials.  The Type A package is made up of a cardboard box (~15 in.x15 in.), a Styrofoam insert for impact and penetration protection, a lead pot for shielding and a vial containing the medical isotope.  The Styrofoam insert may also contain dry ice.  The tag portion of the system will be embedded internally in the Type A package, external to the lead pot.  The reader portion of the system will be placed at multiple locations along the expected route of the shipment.  Commonly used medical radioisotopes will be shipped from two suppliers in Boston, Mass. to ORNL in Oak Ridge, Tenn. using two commercial air express carriers.  
	
The demonstration will include two phases:  a laboratory evaluation phase and a live express shipping environment phase.  The laboratory phase will be scenario-specific to address procedures and protocols needed to conduct the live express shipping environment phase.  In addition, the laboratory phase will include radiation exposure tests to demonstrate the tag’s ability to function properly in gamma and neutron radiation fields for the lifetime claimed by the tag’s manufacturer.  

Requirements:  Interested parties should provide tags with omnidirectional read distances up to 50 feet at a frequency available worldwide.  The reader must be able to recognize the tags when transported in metal trailers traveling at speeds up to 30 mph.  The reader must be able to recognize tags in the presence of other tags.  Readers will be needed to read tags at eight locations:  one at each medical isotope supplier in Boston, Mass., one at each air express terminal at Logan International Airport in Boston, Mass, one at each air express terminal at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tenn., and two at ORNL in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Tags may be subjected to any and all weather conditions and normal shipping and handling conditions.  The systems should have a lifespan of seven years without maintenance.  The systems should have an application programming interface (API) providing programmatic access to tag data including, at a minimum, the tag ID and a timestamp of when it is seen by a reader.

Parties interested in providing their equipment for test are requested to address any specification issues, provide product information and identify Internet Web sites containing relevant information.  The POC for technical issues is Mr. Randy Walker, (865) 574-5522, e-mail walkerrm1@ornl.gov.  An information meeting for prospective vendors will be held in Knoxville, Tenn. on Monday, October 24, 2005 at 1:00PM.  Interested vendors should contact Ms. Tracy Warren, (865) 241-5989, e-mail warrenta@ornl.gov.  A statement of qualifications, including references for past and present RFID technology deployments, and a catalog of commercially available equipment should be submitted before c.o.b. November 1, 2005 to Ms. Tracy Warren, 1 Bethel Valley Road, P.O. Box 2008, MS 6418, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6418.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division, AAC/XRS, intends to solicit and award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Ellwood National Forge Company, Irvine, PA to produce 20 BLU-121/B warhead cases from Eglin Steel (ES-1C).  This requirement can only be met by Ellwood National Forge Company because they are the only producer of ES-1C steel that consistently meets the Government’s requirements and that can machine the BLU-121/B bomb case in accordance with the applicable drawing.  The Contractor will qualify the steel material for each warhead case by conducting a suite of mechanical property tests on heat-treated specimens obtained from the case material and providing the results to the Government.  If multiple cases come from a single ingot, all cases from that ingot can be qualified from a single suite of mechanical property specimens.

The test specimens should be prepared as follows:  heat-treat a minimum of one qualification sample from each forged ingot.  These samples will be heat-treated in the same furnace that is used to heat-treat the warhead.  Two pieces of steel, each approximating the mass of a BLU-121/B warhead, should be heat-treated along with the qualification samples to simulate a typical heat-treat load.  The Contractor will test three tensile and six Charpy impact specimens from each ingot and provide the results to AAC/XRS.  

The Government reserves the right to conduct its own suite of property tests to validate samples taken.

The required properties to be obtained from the specimen tests are listed below.  The “Single Test Minimum” refers to the minimum properties for any single test specimen.  The “Average” refers to the minimum average of at least three test specimens from any single qualification sample.

Qualification Test Properties:  Single Test Minimum/Average (of at least 3) - - Ultimate Tensile Strength:  min Yu = 240 ksi/avg Yu = 244ksi;  Static Yield Strength: min Ys = 188 ksi/avg Ys = 192 ksi; % Strain to Failure: min Sf  = 12.0%/avg Sf  = 13.0%; Charpy Impact (at -40ºF): min CI = 16 ft-lbs/avg CI = 19 ft-lbs. 

The AF Contracting Officer, or her representative, will notify the contractor of any  ingot or bomb case failing to meet minimum properties and unacceptable under this contract.   

The contractor shall measure the mass and center of gravity of each warhead in both unassembled and fully-assembled states and deliver the resulting data.  Weight limits should fall within the acceptable CG limits of a MK-84.  Cases are to be delivered to the government NLT 15 July 2006.

The technical data package is undergoing revisions and is not available at this time.  The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.  The AAC Ombudsman is Col Susan Mashiko, AAC/DC(S), 101 West “D” Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL  32542, (850) 882-0662, susan.mashiko@eglin.af.mil.  The Alternate Ombudsman is Mr. Dennis Love, AAC/XP, 101 West “D” Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL  32542, (850) 882-0312, jdennis.love@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is seeking to identify all responsible sources capable of providing RFID systems for tracking, locating, and identifying express shipments of medical isotopes.  Firms that have the prerequisite background knowledge, experience, and capability to be able to successfully meet or exceed the requirements described herein are invited to participate in a two phase demonstration of their technology.  This is not a request for bids, but an invitation to participate in a demonstration that is targeted to lead to the deployment of an operational system to track and monitor radiological sources in commerce.  Vendors must provide full product line literature and available documentation of equipment and interfaces for their proposed products.  Vendors must also provide product line samples as appropriate and requested.  All expenses related to literature reproduction and dissemination; provision of product line samples, product line and services demonstrations; demonstration support; marketing; and appropriate in-service education related to the referenced two phase demonstration must be at no charge to the government.  Multiple vendors will be utilized in this demonstration.

ORNL desires to evaluate the use of RFID systems to monitor express air and truck shipments of medical radioisotopes.  Vendors are being sought to provide a solution that will monitor the shipments while in transit using passive, active, or hybrid RFID tags or a combination thereof.  ORNL intends to demonstrate RFID systems, typically consisting of a “tag” and a “reader” component, appropriate for the express air and truck shipping environment.  Result of the demonstration will be published.

USA Department of Transportation (DOT) Type A packages are used for shipping small quantities of medical radioisotopes.  This packaging conforms to condition and limitations specified in 49 CRR 173.4 for radioactive materials.  The Type A package is made up of a cardboard box (~15 in.x15 in.), a Styrofoam insert for impact and penetration protection, a lead pot for shielding and a vial containing the medical isotope.  The Styrofoam insert may also contain dry ice.  The tag portion of the system will be embedded internally in the Type A package, external to the lead pot.  The reader portion of the system will be placed at multiple locations along the expected route of the shipment.  Commonly used medical radioisotopes will be shipped from two suppliers in Boston, Mass. to ORNL in Oak Ridge, Tenn. using two commercial air express carriers.  
	
The demonstration will include two phases:  a laboratory evaluation phase and a live express shipping environment phase.  The laboratory phase will be scenario-specific to address procedures and protocols needed to conduct the live express shipping environment phase.  In addition, the laboratory phase will include radiation exposure tests to demonstrate the tag’s ability to function properly in gamma and neutron radiation fields for the lifetime claimed by the tag’s manufacturer.  

Requirements:  Interested parties should provide tags with omnidirectional read distances up to 50 feet at a frequency available worldwide.  The reader must be able to recognize the tags when transported in metal trailers traveling at speeds up to 30 mph.  The reader must be able to recognize tags in the presence of other tags.  Readers will be needed to read tags at eight locations:  one at each medical isotope supplier in Boston, Mass., one at each air express terminal at Logan International Airport in Boston, Mass, one at each air express terminal at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tenn., and two at ORNL in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Tags may be subjected to any and all weather conditions and normal shipping and handling conditions.  The systems should have a lifespan of seven years without maintenance.  The systems should have an application programming interface (API) providing programmatic access to tag data including, at a minimum, the tag ID and a timestamp of when it is seen by a reader.

Parties interested in providing their equipment for test are requested to address any specification issues, provide product information and identify Internet Web sites containing relevant information.  The POC for technical issues is Mr. Randy Walker, (865) 574-5522, e-mail walkerrm1@ornl.gov.  An information meeting for prospective vendors will be held in Knoxville, Tenn. on Monday, October 24, 2005 at 8:00AM.  Interested vendors should contact Ms. Tracy Warren, (865) 241-5989, e-mail warrenta@ornl.gov.  A statement of qualifications, including references for past and present RFID technology deployments, and a catalog of commercially available equipment should be submitted before c.o.b. November 1, 2005 to Ms. Tracy Warren, 1 Bethel Valley Road, P.O. Box 2008, MS 6418, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6418.  Electronic notifications of material being sent are welcome and should be sent to Ms. Tracy Warren, warrenta@ornl.gov.  Responses should be in original copy and format with a signature and date.

<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541690 with an associated size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes a good portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541690 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes the majority of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541513 with an associated size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.

<DESC>The Prescott National Forest plans to secure Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple year contracts for professional surveying services as required for administration of National Forest System Lands in Northern Arizona.  The work will primarily involve surveying and marking property boundaries of land within the Prescott National Forest Proclamation Boundary, but may also include projects on the adjacent Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. 
The Forest Service anticipates award of approximately two IDIQ contracts with task orders issued estimated at approximately $5,000.00 to $30,000.00 with an estimated contract maximum of $150,000.00 per contract over the life of the contract.  An Arizona Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the state in of Arizona will be considered.
Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys that will require the results of survey to be recorded in the public record. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. A map of the general work area (Northern Arizona) is available for ftp download by contacting rjjackson@fs.fed.us. 
Estimated award date is on or about November 1, 2005.  Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
PURSUANT TO FAR 15.202(e)


INTRODUCTION 

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is developing its requirements for filing of paper reports. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the SEC in formulating its requirements, and identify qualified quoters who are able to meet our requirements.  

The SEC is open to alternative ideas.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help the SEC better define its requirements and obtain a contract management solution that meets its needs.  

BACKGROUND

For most of its 72 year history, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required the filing of paper reports.  Since the 1980s, the very same paper reports are filed in electronic form, but the information remains static.  Beginning this year, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission is encouraging the submission of unofficial financial statements and other reports using interactive data.

By using computer codes to "tag" different kinds of data in financial reports, the information companies file with the Commission can be made much easier to find and analyze. For example, specific items in a financial statement, such as net income or gross sales, are given computer-readable labels.  At the same time, the task of preparing the reports can be automated for the companies who file them.

Interactive data relies on standard definitions to "tag" various kinds of information, turning SEC financial reports that have previously been text-only into documents that can be retrieved through computer searches, and analyzed in a variety of spreadsheet programs and analytical software.  The data can also be more readily used to compare companies’ financial performance, and better identify “outliers” that could represent attractive investment opportunities – or increased risk of misstatements or fraud.

The use of interactive data, if widely adopted, could dramatically enhance the usefulness of reported financial information.  Consumers of the data would be able to use it more easily and effectively.  Potentially, computer-tagged data could provide real-time operational information for business managers.  And its instant availability could dramatically streamline and accelerate the collection and reporting of that same financial information to the SEC and the public.   

For now, this is a voluntary program, to allow filers, the SEC, and the users of SEC reports to test the process.  For filers, this means an opportunity to assess the benefits and costs of using interactive data.  For the SEC, it means evaluating the Commission's ability to process and store documents in Extensible Business Reporting language, or XBRL -- the computer language used in the SEC pilot program that makes interactive data possible.  For users of SEC reports, it will afford an opportunity to consider the value added from interactive data, as well as to pilot various software applications to take advantage of the new flexibility in using the information.

The current program was inaugurated a few months ago, on February 3, 2005, when the SEC adopted rule amendments formally establishing the XBRL Voluntary Program.  This new program allows for the voluntary submission of XBRL documents as exhibits to certain periodic reports and investment company act filings. 

PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is assessing whether the use of tagged data in SEC filings would provide a better means to obtain and analyze necessary information from registrants. Concept Release 33-8417, http://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/33-8497.htm. In furtherance of that effort, on February 3, 2005, the SEC adopted rule amendments establishing the XBRL Voluntary Filing Program on EDGAR, which allows for the voluntary submission of XBRL-formatted exhibits with certain periodic reports. Final Release 33-8529, http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-8529.htm. The XBRL Voluntary Filing Program was established to allow:

•	the filing community to test the submission of XBRL documents,
•	the SEC to examine the processing and storage of XBRL documents,
•	the dissemination community to receive XBRL documents and to consider or pilot value added services,
•	the investing community to download XBRL documents and explore their use, and
•	the SEC staff to investigate and pilot various mechanisms to view and analyze the XBRL-tagged information.
 
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to help the SEC meet the original goals of the Voluntary Filing Program, and in particular to assist the SEC staff to identify and assess mechanisms for viewing and analyzing submitted data. We are using the RFI to gather additional information to help the SEC to understand the capabilities of XBRL and related software packages and to identify qualified vendors who might be able to meet our future requirements.  

While this RFI focuses on XBRL, the SEC remains open to alternative ideas and considerations, as the Concept Release indicated.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information, about XBRL or alternative methodologies that can help the SEC better understand the potential of using tagged data formats and assess whether solutions exist that might meet its needs.  

DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth in the Potential Requirements Table attached hereto are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the product’s capabilities as against the potential requirements, the product’s system requirements, the product’s integration specification (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the SEC’s understanding of the information submitted. Also, vendors with a GSA schedule should provide the contract number of that schedule.

Respondents should also complete the Potential Requirements Table which contains provisional requirements for the SEC’s XBRL and tagged data initiative. We recognize that not all requirements may be met by a single software system. Please indicate in your response which capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software versus custom developed solutions. For requirements that are met by commercial off the shelf software, please also include the product name, release number and release date of the software.

DISCLAIMER 

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must comply with the SEC’s confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. 

HOW TO RESPOND

Please submit your response to this RFI via email to Amy Alvarey at alvareya@sec.gov, phone 202.551.7313, by Friday, December 2, 2005, at 10:00 A.M. EST.

<DESC>The United States Army Kwajalein Atoll/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS) is seeking industry capabilities for meteorological support services (MSS).  USAKA/RTS is located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) approximately 2,100 nautical miles wes t-southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, 9 degrees north latitude and 167 degrees east longitude, approximately 700 miles north of the equator, in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  USAKA/RTS is located west of the international dateline resulting in a nor mal government workweek of Tuesday through Saturday, which corresponds with the Continental United States Monday through Friday workweek.  USAKA/RTS is home for approximately 2,500 U.S. Government civilian, military, and contractor personnel who perform v arious roles in support of the missions of USAKA/RTS.  USAKA/RTS provides substandard unaccompanied housing and limited family housing, limited dental and medical facilities, schools (preschool  12), dining facilities, department and grocery stores with l imited choices, recreational activities and most of the amenities of a small town of comparable size.  The primary mode of transportation is bicycle with no privately owned motor vehicles allowed.  As a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), RTS is re quired to provide meteorology support as part of its test support capability.  Consequently, RTS has a continuing need for MSS to support operations by collecting, processing, and interpreting meteorological data; providing specialized weather forecasts; a nd providing meteorological consultation services.  Additionally, MSS are needed to perform the normal duties of a weather forecast office and meteorological observatory.  A Top Secret facility clearance will be required for this effort.  It is anticipated  that foreign participation will not be allowed at the prime or subcontract level.  Interested firms are requested to provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions (see numbere d note 25).  Information should be provided to the Contract Specialist via e-mail at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil no later than October 18, 2005.

<SUBJECT>--FAMILY OF MEDIUM TACTICAL VEHICLES POWERTRAIN SUPPORT MARKET SURVEY
<DESC>Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, experience, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) Powertrain Supp ort Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program.   IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness, inc reased reliability, enhanced logistics response times, enhanced deployment support, enhanced wartime support, reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.    Under this PBL contract, the contractor will be responsible for the management of the FMTV (A0, A1, A1R) powertrain (engine/transmission) to insure future supply and maintenance support. The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.   Some considerations of the proposed PBL approach will include, but not be limited to the following: 1.	Acknowledge initial feedback to customer request within 24hrs.  Establishment of repair times. 2.	Establishment of supply points and repair facilities in both CONUS/OCONUS. 3.	Remove, replace, repair capability 4.	Movement of vehicles/components from customer site to repair facility and back 5.	This is not intended to manage configuration control of the power train.  Configuration will still flow through the ECP process. 6.	Maintain SA/Readiness levels of 90%  e.g. repair floats used 7.	Establishment of a funding/requisition process 8.	Reporting/documentation of program accountability 9.	Utilization of current Government assets in this CLS program 10. Reliability goals 11. Wartime vs. peacetime operations In addition further useful information from the contractor would include: 1.	What additional resources would be required to support the PBL concept described? 2.	What timeframe would be required to ramp-up resources needed to fully support the requirement?  PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price long-term contract.  Length to be determined.   Goal: Our goal is to structure a contract, which will incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  Operational readiness 90% or better.  Enhanced Logistics response times.  Enhanced deployment.  Reduced Logistics Footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times.  Reduced Logistics costs.  Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Operational Readiness - Standard Army readiness reporting will be used to the maximum extent possible.  Also, we will measure mission start and completion performance.  (Vehicle starts and completes mission XX% of time)  Logistics Response Time  The period of time from when a failure/malfunction is detected and validated by the maintainer to the time the failure/malfunction has been resolved.  This includes all related time to order, ship and deliver parts and perform mai ntenance.  Reduced Logistics Footprint  Measurable reduction in number of tools reqd  (special and common).  Measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair   and troubleshooting tasks. Measurable reduction of training required.  Measurable increase in fuel economy.  Any other reduction in the size or presence of logistics support required to deploy, sustain and move the Tactical Wheeled Vehicle fleet. Cost per Mile  Total Operating Costs divided by the total number of miles driven. See Appendix B for Materiel System Description. PBL MARKET SURVEY  QUESTIONAIRE 1.   Name of Firm       Address       City, State, Zip Code       Point of Contact Name       Telephone Number       Email Address       Website Address 2.  What would be your business approach to meeting these responsibilities for managing the FMTV powertrain support? 3.  What potential constraints or boundaries do you see with one contractor having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under this component specific PBL arrangement? 4.  Do you have any further suggestions, beyond those listed in the Proposed Measurements paragraph above, for measuring performance of the PBL, particularly supply support, reliability, training and maintenance?   6.  What would you recommend as the approach to supply chain management in support of the vehicle fleets? 7.  How would you approach performance of sustainment maintenance and reduce vehicle maintenance, both scheduled and unscheduled? 8. Would you be willing to provide this type of support under a long-term contract?    What length of contract would you need in order to make this a viable proposition? 9. What would you do differently in support of deployment contingency (wartime vs peacetime) operations? Response to this market research survey questionnaire should be sent via email to albrechc@tacom.army.mil.  You can respond in total or to any part of this questionnaire. Any product literature that cannot be emailed may be sent to: 	U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command 	Attn: SFAE-CSS-TV-S (C. Albrecht), M/S 500 	6501 E. Eleven Mile Rd.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES

The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

A.	INTRODUCTION

The Senior Military Advisor PSC will play a lead role in development of the new Office of Military Affairs (OMA), developing systems for integrating USAID and DOD planning and operations, and overseeing the placement, structure and successful start-up of senior development advisors to be stationed in combatant commands.  In the absence of the Division Chief, Planning, the PSC will serve as head of the OMA planning function and the creation of planning systems.  His/her function is critical to the successful evaluation and development of sound reconstruction and stabilization programs based on lessons learned from recent major civil-military actions, and the creation of effective coordination mechanisms between USAID and the US military.

B.	BACKGROUND

The USAID Office of Military Affairs (OMA) was created as of March 2005.  It is housed within the USAID Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA Bureau, also home to the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), Food for Peace (FFP), Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Democracy and Governance (DG) Offices), but its responsibilities are Agency-wide.  Its objective is to help USAID and the military define, evaluate and develop programs and coordination mechanisms that address areas of common interest between the U.S. defense and development communities, including but not limited to the U.S. National Security Strategy.  

To accomplish this objective, the following tasks will be undertaken:

1.  Evaluate and develop joint and parallel planning and programs focused on regional and field missions supported through USAID regional bureaus and DOD combatant commands (COCOMs).  

2.  Develop mutually acceptable guidance, policy and doctrine as needed for effective program development and coordination.  

3.  Implement training, education and operational programs designed to build understanding and operational efficiency between the two organizations.

Areas of common interest will include humanitarian assistance, the global war on terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, and transformational development.  

The office will serve as the Agency-wide unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship.  This responsibility includes program planning and implementation needed for effective operations involving USAID and the military, and the development of operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The office will consist of two divisions, one for planning and one for operations.  The functions of the planning division  is to serve as the overall coordination unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship, and for planning, program development/management needed for effective future joint and parallel operations involving USAID and the military (U.S. and others).  The operations division will serve as the lead unit to develop operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  As noted, the Senior Military Advisor will help oversee both divisions.  

A key aspect of OMA operations will be liaison with key units of DOD.  USAID will have one or two officers who work directly within the Pentagon, one reporting to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (OSD/SOLIC), which coordinates Special Operations, Humanitarian Assistance and Civil Affairs in DOD, and another reporting to the Joint Staff.  In addition, the locus of informed and enhanced field operations within the US military resides in the combatant commands, both regional and functional.  The key regional commands of specific interest to USAID are as follows:

CENTCOM, or Central Command.  Located at McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, CENTCOM is responsible for field operations throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.  This command covers Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Central Asia, making it the most important and active command at this point in time.

EUCOM, or the European Command.  Located in Stuttgart, Germany, EUCOM is responsible for North, West and Southern Africa, the Caucuses, Europe and Russia.  Africa is now its most strategically important territory.  

PACOM, or the Pacific Command.  Located at Camp Smith in Honolulu, HI, PACOM is responsible for Asia and the Pacific up to the border of Pakistan.  While northern Asia (China, Japan and Korea) are key areas of focus, Southeast and South Asia are increasingly important in the Global War on Terror.  Indonesia and the Philippines are of particular importance.  

SOUTHCOM, or the Southern Command.  Located in Miami, FL, SOUTHCOM is responsible for South and Central America.  Although natural disaster and counter-narcotics responses have been the major focus of civ-mil operations in the recent past, there is a growing list of countries of concern and joint interest on the development front in the region.  

SOCOM, or the Special Operations Command.  Located in McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, SOCOM oversees Special Forces of all services, Information Operations and Civil Affairs.  SOCOM is considered the lead command for the Global War on Terror.  Civil Affairs is a key interlocutor with USAID in most countries on humanitarian and development assistance, and will likely look to a more collaborative relationship with USAID under emerging stability operations programs under DOD.

OMA will be placing a selected number of senior development advisors within the regional and functional commands.  All of the senior development advisors will report to the Senior Military Advisor.   

C. 	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) will serve as USAID’s senior military advisor within the Office of Military Affairs (DCHA/OMA).  The overall objective will be to successfully start up the Office, its links with the military, and its development of joint DOD/USAID planning and operations systems, including new and modified programs of mutual interest.  The PSC must have significant military and USAID experience, which is deemed essential to the starting up of the new Office of Military Affairs and the development of appropriate systems and relationships.

(25%)

2.  The PSC will coordinate and advise DCHA, the Military Policy Board, and various regional bureaus in USAID, and DOD, on the evaluation and development of programs and activities that may lie outside of Theater Security Cooperation Plans.

Building on the development of regional and functional command interagency structures, the PSC will help create organizational structures and interface systems that accommodate new programs and institutional linkages.  (10%)

3.  The PSC will lead the development and operation of structures and systems that link and inform field missions, regional bureaus and DOD command structures facilitated by the USAID senior development officers in regional and functional commands.  This will include the development and management of complex emergency response systems that involve the U.S. military.  (20%)  

4.  The PSC will create, foster and formalize a network of working relationships between USAID and the US military, with a focus on leaders throughout the Pentagon to include Joint Staff and OSD, leaders of the various regional and functional commands, key service institutions involved in training and deployment, USAID regional bureaus and the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (PPC), key USAID contractors and grantees working on programs of mutual interest, Washington decision-makers, other key donors and partners, and lead non-US military groups  such as NATO and other country services.  Represent USAID interests in the development of the relationship with DOD with respect to the Agency’s development agenda, its status as an independent Agency, and its code of conduct.  The relationship should be formalized through proposed details and sharing agreements, establishment of routine procedures, meetings and events that tie the organizations together, and recommended structural changes within the organizations that may be deemed appropriate over time to enhance cooperation.  (15%)  

5.  Lead the development, conduct and evaluation of training, exercises and joint activities that strengthen USAID-military cooperation.  This includes cooperation with the State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) and with the Joint Forces Command as these two organizations continue the development of future structures for interagency coordination with the US military and multinational organizations.  (15%)

6.  The PSC will work with the Office Director, OMA, in the development of the new Office.  These duties will include review and development of new staff positions, oversight of budget processes, the development of new grant and contracts deemed necessary to support and enhance OMA’s role, the establishment of key office systems for effective management and expansion, and the development of training programs for office staff.  The PSC will work with the USAID Management Bureau Office of Information Resources Management (M/IRM), DOD and others to build up a communications and information sharing network, including classified systems needed to improve interagency and civil-military planning and operations for complex emergency responses.
