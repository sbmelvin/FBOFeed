<p>The contractor shall work through the drafting and clearance of each proposed regulation (clearance will be authorized by CVM Senior Management, the Policy and Regulation Group, and the Office of Chief Counsel prior to publication). The contractor shall also participate in the review of comments and the drafting and clearance of final rules. To draft these regulations, the contractor must have in-depth knowledge and experience of the new animal drug approval process and the requirements that are imposed post approval. The contractor shall be completely familiar with the FD&amp;C Act and MUMS Act, and the implementing regulations.

<p>&bull; The contractor shall author and update two (2) guidance documents for industry regarding significant programs (Designation and Indexing) affecting minor species and minor use drugs. This will require the contractor to have a complete understanding of the MUMS Act and implementing regulations. The contractor shall have experience in writing regulations/guidance in this subject area. The contractor also shall submit regulation/guidance documents to the clearance process, respond to public comments on the draft, and write the final version of the guidance documents.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor shall also comment on and review proposed revisions to the Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The contractor shall review public comments and assist in the writing of the final version of the regulations and shall review and comment on the associated Agency-level guidance document(s).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor shall also be responsible for review of the description of manufacturing process for drugs seeking addition to the Index. This requires the contractor to have some experience with the chemistry and systems associated with the manufacture of new animal drugs.</p>
<p>Communications</p>
<p>The contractor shall engage in communication across offices within CVM, across the agency, and with numerous external stakeholders including consumers and the regulated industry.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor shall attend pre-submission conferences for minor use projects to present MUMS options to sponsors when requested. This requires the contractor to have an in-depth understanding of available incentives including user fee waivers, conditional approval, designation, and research partnerships with outside public and private entities. This also requires the contractor to have contacts in such research settings.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor shall participate in development of agreements between agencies on issues of jurisdiction and harmonization of policies. The contractor shall have knowledge of statutes governing other agencies, such as Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).</p>
