<p>The Natick Contracting Division (NCD) located at 13501 Ingenuity Drive, Suite 200, Orlando, FL 32826 hereby issues the following synopsis W911QY-13-R-0007 as a Small Business Set-aside for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management, unclassified items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 5.1, 15.201 and 19.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.</p>
<p>The solicitation document will incorporate provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. The associated NAICS code is 611512 Flight Training and the Small Business size standard is $25.5 M. Proposals shall be good for 180 calendar days after close of proposal period. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is applicable, with an assigned rating of DO-A1. A Sources Sought Notice was published in the FedBizOpps on 1 March 2012, where more than two small businesses responded that were judged to be able to meet the requirements. Based on this and other Market Research, a determination was made to set the effort aside 100% for Small Business. Therefore, only qualified Small Business offerors may submit their Proposals for the anticipated Solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for Training, Logistics Support, and Technical / Program Management for a full spectrum of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) and Parts required to support the SUAS Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, and its domestic and foreign customers. The Army has a requirement to sustain/maintain the 1798 RQ-11B and 325 RQ-20A systems currently fielded, and alternative medium and long range systems procured in the future.</p>
<p>The objective of the SUAS Support Program is to support the Warfighters as well as other Governmental<br />Agencies (OGAs) and Non-Governmental Agencies users' SUAS-related sustainment needs. These needs<br />primarily include SUAS training, maintenance, repairs, and engineering services. Additionally, the SUAS PdO will require various non-SETA logistics, technical management, and program management services to support its SUAS customers. The approximate percentage of effort in each area of focus is: Flight Training - 60%, Contractor Logistics - 35%, Technical/Program Management - 5%.</p>
<p>Complete individual instructor flight packets shall be submitted as part of the offeror's proposal for evaluation by the PM UAS GFR. Instructor flight packets will include the following four items: two DD forms 1821 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 4, AR 95-20); Crewmember resume; two DD Forms 2627 (one each for RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma, IAW Attachment 3, AR 95-20); FAA Medical Certification (Class 33 or higher). Note: Offerors shall provide with their proposal no less than fourteen (14) Individual Instructor Flight Packets for proposed GFR Certified instructors. The resume portion of the packet shall indicate if the person is a current employee or a contingency hire upon award.</p>
<p>SUAS Trainers shall be certified on all SUAS products available from the Army inventory (currently RQ-11B Raven and RQ-20A Puma). While the below table is not a training schedule, it provides the minimum workforce required in the post-award period. The offerors shall be able to show its ability to reach these workforce levels. For example, 14 GFR-certified Puma trainers will be required for various training missions in MAY 2013 (6 in OEF, 8 in CONUS). In JUNE 2013, the required Puma trainers will increase from 14 to18, and 10 Raven trainers will also be required. This escalation continues until 22 Puma trainers, and 22 Raven trainers are available to conduct the anticipated maximum training density (total of 44 interchangeable trainers). <br />Note: actual training schedules will be published as a formal requirement in subsequent Task Orders, post-IDIQ award. The below table is not to be interpreted as a schedule, and as such it is not guaranteed that the maximum training density will be required in August or September, etc.</p>

<p><br />A Single award, Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is most appropriate to support this effort. The contract Period of Performance (PoP) is five years with a Base Period of three years, and 2 one-year option periods with CLINS 0001-00XX are applicable to the Base Period, CLINS 1001-10XX will apply to the first option period, and CLINS 2001-20XX will apply to the last option period.

<p>The first delivery order is due 120 days after the date of award. The destination is Pendergrass, GA (VSTQ).</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside that will result in a firm fixed price contract, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity Type Contract. This is a Best Value acquisition with Source Selection Procedures. The following factors will be utilized in descending order of importance: Production Demonstration Model (PDM) and Past Performance-Performance Confidence Assessment. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the number of most highly-rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range will exceed the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. The Contracting Officer may conduct the technical evaluation using a two-phase process pursuant to provision 52.215-9PC1, as contained in the Addendum to provision 52.212-2, Additional Source Selection Evaluation Procedures (applicable to Commercial Item Acquisitions only) or Section M (applicable to other than Commercial Item Acquisitions only). During the first phase of this evaluation process, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Past performance is not being considered in the first phase. Those offerors who have submitted PDMs that are most highly rated and who have submitted price proposals that are realistic and competitive with other offerors who have submitted most highly rated PDMs will then be evaluated in the second phase of this evaluation process for the remaining technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>All materials used in the fabrication of the end item are to be furnished by the contractor with the exception of the basic fabric which will be provided as Government Furnish Material (GFM). The Government does not intend to use FAR part 12 for this acquisition. Reference Numbered Notes 1, 9, and 26.</p>

Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>
<p>CAUTION NOTICE: CLAUSE 52.215-9023 REVERSE AUCTION (AUG 2011) DLAD is being included in the solicitation to permit the Contracting Officer to utilize this on-line reverse auctioning technique as a means of conducting price discussions if deemed advantageous to the government.

Offerors will be trained via a simulated auction to familiarize themselves with the system, prior to the auction taking place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />CAUTION NOTICE -- TWO-PHASE TECHNICAL/PRICE EVALUATION <br />(AUG 2007) DSCP</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that numerous offerors will submit proposals on solicitation. In the event that eight or more proposals are received, the Government may use a two-phase evaluation process, which allows the Contracting Officer to conduct a preliminary evaluation of all offers, in order to determine which offers are the least likely to be candidates for further consideration. During this preliminary evaluation, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Certain offerors may be excluded from further consideration at this point, if their PDM ratings and/or offered prices are not competitive when compared with PDM ratings and prices proposed by other offerors. The remaining offers will then be evaluated for the remaining technical evaluation factors. After the completion of this review, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to establish a competitive range and enter into negotiations, or to award without discussions. This process is set forth in provision 52.215-9P23, Two-Phase Technical/Price Evaluation (DPACS # A00E28) contained in solicitation.<br /><br />Please contact Rachel Garcia for inquires on this solicitation at Rachel.Garcia@dla.mil.</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME</strong>.<br /><br />The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the <strong>standardization of Foley and Urethral Catheter Kits &amp; Trays on or about January 2013,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to 45 business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br /><strong>Examples of items</strong> being solicited could include, but are not limited to Foley and Urethral Catheter Kits &amp; Trays to include: Foley Catheter Kit/Tray with 16FR Silicone Catheter, Foley Catheter Kit/Tray with 18FR Silicone Catheter, Urethral Catheter Kit/Tray with 14FR Red Rubber Catheter and Urethral Catheter Kit/Tray with 14FR Vinyl Catheter. <strong>The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $1,087,942.39 annually.</strong>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.</span></strong> Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection, and enforcement of its requirements. The NRC's headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and there are a number of other offices around the United States.
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform Design Engineering Inspections. In accordance with the baseline inspection portion of the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP), the NRC inspects the design and operation of nuclear power reactor plants. These inspections sometimes require contractor technical support.</p>
<p>Component Design Bases Inspections (CDBIs) are the primary inspection under this contract. They verify that design bases have been correctly implemented for the selected risk-significant components and that operating procedures and operator actions are consistent with design and licensing bases. This ensures that selected components are capable of performing their safety functions.</p>
<p>In addition to CDBIs, contract technical support may be required for other inspections of design and operations including (but not limited to): fire protection; plant modifications; supplemental inspections at plants which experience degraded performance; reactive inspections (such as augmented inspection teams and special Inspections); independent design verification programs; and integrated design inspections.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the NRC has had various design engineering inspection programs that required contractor assistance to supplement staff resources. These have included integrated design inspections (IDIs), safety system functional inspections (SSFIs), electrical distribution system functional inspections (EDSFIs), service water system operational performance inspections, safety systems design and performance capability (SSDPC), fire protection inspections, and CDBIs.</p>
<p>The NRC has found it beneficial to form inspection teams including contractors with current nuclear plant experience. These inspections usually start with design requirements, and follow the plant implementation through plant operations and maintenance practices.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. The expected period of performance is a base period of three years with two additional one-year periods.</p>

<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia intends to award a five-year contract to a U.S. 8(a) firm and/or local Ethiopian firm by issuing a Request for Proposal for the Local Capacity Development (LCD) Project in Ethiopia. The purpose of the LCD is to provide capacity building to local Ethiopian NGOs that are the recipients of the Fostering Local Capacity By Working with New Development Partners (FLCWNDP) program so that they are better able to meet USAID's financial and programmatic reporting requirements, thereby increasing their likelihood of being awarded future grants as envisioned by USAID Forward reforms.<br />The Contractor must build the capacity of up to 20 NGOs in their understanding of and adherence to USAID systems by selecting areas of focus on a tiered system of priorities. If the Contractor deems one area to have been developed/strengthened, it can then move on to the next tier. The work is to be performed in Ethiopia and will require engaging local staff and/or having both English and Amharic capability. The Contractor will also have to obtain a license by registering with the Government of Ethiopia.<br />The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to alert U.S. 8(a) firms and local Ethiopian firms of USAID/Ethiopia's intention to issue a request for proposals and to give these firms the opportunity to organize a proposal preparation team. This will be a competitive award.<br />Interested organizations are requested to provide electronically a brief 1-3 page capability statement describing the organizations capabilities and experience in building the capacity of small to mid-size organizations. In particular, their abilities and experience developing:
<p>&bull; Financial systems: Develop and strengthen the financial systems of targeted NGO's in the general category of planning, organizing, reporting, controlling and monitoring resources.<br />&bull; Project Management Systems: Develop and strengthen NGO's in planning, organizing, reporting controlling and monitoring projects, standards in service delivery and developing monitoring and evaluation plans.<br />&bull; Administrative Management Systems: Develop and strengthen NGO's management of payroll, personnel an automated an IT systems.<br />&bull; Funding: Identify and strengthen areas of sustainable funding, particularly in assisting organizations in identifying diverse funding sources.</p>
<p>Capabilities statements should be emailed to Girma Debelu (gdebelu@usaid.gov) and Gregory Taitt (gtaitt@usaid.gov) before 12 November 2012.<br />The Request for Proposals (RFP) for the LCD project is projected to be issued around December 2012 on www.fedbizopps.gov. USAID will not entertain questions until after the RFP is issued. When the RFP is issued, any amendments thereof will be posted at: www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.<br />The anticipated award will be cost plus fixed-fee. <br />Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to the availability of funds. This pre-solicitation notice in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to modify contract N00039-10-C-0069 with General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S) of Scottsdale, AZ.  This modification will require GDC4S to perform software development and enhancements necessary for the DMR to be interoperable with the Mobile User Object System (MUOS) satellite constellation, provide integrated waveform (IW) capability and allow for additional software and hardware enhancements to ensure the continued viability of the DMR system in meeting the Navy's current and future needs.  This modification will contain Fixed Price (FP) and Cost-Plus (CP) line items.
The addition of these capabilities will address and increase DMR's communications capacity to U.S. Naval ship and submarine platforms and remedy future obsolescence issues.  This work requires the vendor to have detailed knowledge of and extensive experience with the DMR's operator interfaces and software design, including the existing DMR software source code.  As the sole designer and proprietary technical data rights holder for the DMR, GDC4S possesses the requisite knowledge and ability to satisfactorily perform the requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GDC4S as follows:  Manny Serrato at 480-441-0715 or manny.serrato@gdc4s.com.

<DESC>The purpose of this initial market research is to identify potential sources possessing the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for the design, development, test, production, integration, installation, and sustainment of the KC-46 MTS. The KC-46 MTS acquisition strategy focuses on fielding an optimized training system by integrating various forms of media into a "blended" training solution. This blended solution includes the appropriate mix of hardware and software, high-fidelity Maintenance Training Devices (MTDs), Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), along with available KC-46A aircraft. The KC-46 MTS will provide classroom instruction in KC-46A aircraft/maintenance theory, procedures, and systems knowledge utilizing highly interactive IMI viewed in 3-D realistic environments, along with a suite of hardware MTDs augmented with IMI capabilities. Inherent in the KC-46 MTS strategy is to off-load as much training as possible from the KC-46A aircraft to other KC-46 maintenance training media. All facilities, classrooms, training devices, and the training system support center shall be networked to facilitate software updates and access to shared multimedia data throughout the training facilities. Additionally, the training network shall be configurable for collaborative training across classrooms and MTDs based on the curriculum and instructor's needs. The KC-46 MTS will also have interfaces into Air Education and Training Command and Air Mobility Command training management systems. Comprehensive maintenance training shall be provided by Government instructors to support initial qualification, transition, and continuation training for KC-46A maintenance personnel. The KC-46 MTS shall introduce required knowledge and skills to allow the students to become proficient in servicing and maintaining the aircraft, performing operational checks, and troubleshooting aircraft systems. Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) that will benefit from the KC-46 MTS are: 2A5X1-Aerospace Maintenance Specialty (Crew Chief), 2A5X3A-Communication/Navigation/Missions Systems, 2A5X3B-Instrument and Flight Control Systems, 2A5X3C-Electronic Warfare Systems, 2A6X1-Aerospace Propulsion, 2A6X4-Aircraft Fuel Systems, 2A6X5-Aircraft Hydraulic Systems, and 2A6X6- Aircraft Electrical and Environmental Systems. The KC-46 MTS shall use common software to simulate aircraft functions and shall enable the student to interact with simulated aircraft systems in real-time as they would with the actual aircraft. The MTDs shall be augmented with IMI capabilities to help students locate components, perform maintenance procedures, observe internal systems responses, and provide a physical interface for hands-on hardware related tasks. The KC-46 MTS IMI shall be interfaced to real-time aircraft systems simulation and produce high quality interactive graphics. IMI products shall be provided utilizing MIL-HDBK-29612-3A, Development of Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) (Part 3 of 5 Parts) specifications/guidance. IMI products shall include Interactive Courseware (ICW) and the software management tools used in support of instructional programs, and be compliant with the latest version of DoD Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) Technical Standards. The KC-46 MTS courseware shall also be accessible in a self-paced, anytime, anywhere distributed learning capability via the internet. Additional consideration is being investigated regarding 1) "touch screen" technologies for HW simulation and 2) the portability and access of the IMI capability on commercially available hand-held devices. At this time the Government anticipates procuring the following types of KC-46 MTDs: Avionics/Cockpit Maintenance (MX) Trainers, Flight Controls MX Trainers, Boom Trainers, Engine/APU MX Trainers, Fuels Systems Trainers, and Landing Gear Trainers. The number(s) of devices required will be based on throughput estimates that are currently in work. KC-46 MTDs shall be installed at Air Force Active Duty KC-46A Main Operating Bases (MOBs) at CONUS locations to be determined through the Air Force basing process. The KC-46 MTS Contractor shall also be responsible for the following sustainment requirements: operation and maintenance support for all MTDs and IMI to include reliability and availability; the staffing and operation of a Training System Support Center; and Change Management (to include concurrency, obsolescence, technical refresh, and process improvement for the KC-46 MTS). The anticipated acquisition strategy for the KC-46 MTS will include a seven year contract (basic year plus six option years) commencing in CY2015 with expected first deliveries by March 2017.

<CONTACT>Vanessa Colquitt, Contract Specialist , Phone 7812255456, Email vanessa.colquitt@hanscom.af.mil - Ray R. Erne, Contracting Officer, Phone 7812255393, Email ray.erne@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Synopsis: Air Force AN/TMS-2 Portable Doppler Radar (PDR) Contractor Logistic Support
<p>1. GENERAL INFORMATION:<br />For planning and information purposes, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is seeking potential sources for Contractor Logistic Support of the Air Force AN/TMS-2 Portable Doppler Radar. AN/TMS-2s sustainment must be operationally accepted by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). A contractor shall provide supplies and services required to plan, manage, execute engineering, integration, logistics, and operational support tasks; including all software/hardware modifications/upgrades and merchandise purchase options for the current fielded systems.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND: <br />AN/TMS-2 is a Portable Doppler Radar system that detects, collects, makes data available locally, and delivers weather data information to the reach back organization via the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). The JET system combines information with other weather data as part of a comprehensive and ongoing environmental analysis and mission impact assessment which produces weather warnings, watches, advisories, and other mission-essential weather products that are delivered to support air and ground operators. The AN/TMS-2 system enables interoperability to provide consistent and relevant radar analysis information to joint decision makers. AN/TMS-2 will generate radar products using volume scan technology that greatly reduces man-intensive analysis and automates radar control. The AN/TMS-2 system operates at the UNCLASSIFIED security/classification level on DoD-provided common-user communications networks. The United States Air Force has approximately 20 systems at various locations worldwide which can be re-located to other locations within days.</p>
<p>The sustainment effort described herein must be performed such that a common hardware and software configuration baseline is maintained. A common AN/TMS-2 hardware and software configuration baseline is critical to ensure form, fit, and function commonality to concurrently support the AN/TMS-2 mission and its interface with the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET), as well as maintain commonality in operations, maintenance, and logistics among all AN/TMS-2 sites.</p>
<p>3. REQUESTED CAPABILITY<br />The procurement contract is ending and sustainment will begin at the end of that contract. The radar must be maintained and spares supplied. The contractor must fully understand and show prior experience with maintaining radar systems, providing spare parts, and help desk support.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) was established in 1974, and in 1992 it became part of the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. NIDA's mission is to "...lead the Nation in bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction." NIDA supports over 85 percent of the world's research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. NIDA-supported science addresses the most fundamental and essential questions about drug abuse, ranging from the molecule to managed care, and from DNA to community outreach research.<br /><br />NIDA is currently seeking capability statements from qualified Small Businesses having the capability to act as a centralized laboratory to carry out validated quantitative and/or qualitative assays for a variety of compounds in biological specimens collected from preclinical and clinical studies.   The data obtained will be used by NIDA to support the development of new medications for the treatment of drug addiction.  The lab must be able to perform the tasks listed below:
<p>1.  Quantitative assay for samples collected from metabolic, pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies:</p>
<p>The lab must be able to perform quantitative assays for samples collected from preclinical metabolic and pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies, as well as samples collected from all phases of clinical studies.  The analytes include, but are not limited to, potential therapeutic compounds and/their metabolites, abused drugs and/their metabolites, concomitant medications/compounds, and endogenous substances (e.g. proteins, enzymes etc).  Sample matrices include biological fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, etc) and tissues (liver, brain, hair etc).  The analytical lab must be able to develop and validate new assay methods for drugs/metabolites for which established assays do not exist. The analytes may appear in biological matrices at concentrations of low ng/mL or subnanogram/mL and therefore require the use of state of the art analytical methods including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass Spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) and immunoassays.</p>
<p>2. Assay for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers (protein, enzymes, etc):</p>
<p>The lab must be able to perform assays for surrogate outcome measures and/molecular biomarkers for the assessment of efficacy and safety of study medications in clinical trials.  Monitoring of abused drugs in biological fluids serves as a surrogate outcome measure for assessing drug use in clinical trials.  The abused drugs include, but are not limited to, cocaine/benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite), methamphetamine, amphetamine, morphine (or morphine-glucuronide), cannabinoids, and benzodiazepines.  Automated qualitative/semi-quantitative immunoassays are general used for screening of abused drugs in biological fluids, primarily in urine.  Validated quantitative methods using GC-MS or LC-MS are generally required for confirmatory/quantitative assay for samples which showed positive for screening.   Immunoassays are generally required for quantitative assay of molecular biomarkers.</p>
<p>3. Sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices:</p>
<p>The lab is required to supply clinical sites with sample collection and shipping containers, as well as on-site test devices for screening of abused drugs.</p>
<p>The methods for quantitative assays must be validated for reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the concentration ranges required for the preclinical and clinical studies. Appropriate FDA guidance regarding assay validation must be followed.  The assay must be carried out in compliance with pertinent current Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The analytical laboratory must have automated equipment for handling sample preparation and injection as well as computer software for data acquisition and report generation.  The lab must have sufficient resources to ensure high throughput of samples.  The lab must provide secured facilities appropriate for storing biological samples and analytical data as well as computerized systems for tracking samples.</p>
<p>In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Registration for Chemical Analysis or a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT:</p>
<p>The established NAICS code is 541712. Information sent should be relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  (1) Experience: An outline of previous similar projects and work in the field of drug abuse; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists and/or technical personnel who may be assigned as project director and other key positions; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of facilities and equipment required to conduct this type of work.

<DESC>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice is being issued as a Request For Information (RFI). The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (U&amp;W), Precision Strike Weapons Program (PMA-201) is seeking information from industry on innovative concepts for evolutionary improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 electronic tail fuze. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This RFI is intended to be used for market research and technology survey purposes to assist PMA-201 in developing an acquisition strategy for potential future competition. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. <br /><br /><strong>General Description:</strong>The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139 is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to evaluate technologies and identify potential technology insertion opportunities to facilitate an FMU-139 fuze upgrade process through an evolutionary upgrade approach. As a result of this RFI, the Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources in the form of a concept summary paper containing a description of technical data defining proposed upgrade concepts. The concept summary paper shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the concept and development methodology could satisfy below stated requirements. Each concept summary paper should include a top level description of the proposed upgrade concepts, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, scope of development effort, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed concepts including key subsystems, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for the proposed concepts. FMU-139 Fuze upgrade concepts shall address ability to maintain current integration capability with the F/A-18A+/C/D/E/F and the AV-8B fixed wing aircraft. Desired upgrade concepts include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Hardened target capability (threshold = 5,000 PSI target, Objective = 15,000 PSI target). <br />&bull; Serial Data Interface (SDI) technology to enable communication between fuze and aircraft Operational Flight Program.<br />&bull; An in-line or other electronic design. Of special interest would be a design to minimize the number of moving parts and electro-explosive devices in the fuze. Reduction in overall part and assembly counts in the fuze structure and circuit card assemblies with the desired result of improved fuze producability and reliability. <br />&bull; Replacement of current retard and impact sensors with any number of low power sensors including, but not limited to, piezoelectric sensors, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, rolleron devices, and investigation of the sensor designs currently used in the automotive industry. Of special interest would be the speed and consistency of detection timing, as well as producability and reliability improvements.<br />&bull; Detonator Improvements, including the use of a possible replacement material for both the Lead Azide and Lead Styphnate ultimately leading to the qualification of a lead-free detonator.<br />&bull; Front panel switch improvement or replacement, to improve upon the producability, reliability, and aging concerns that have been experienced.<br />&bull; Post-impact intelligent fuzing, allowing for fuze reaction to terminal impact conditions.<br />&bull; Variable output fuzing for initiation of selectable output weapons.<br />&bull; Environmental Sensing concept to prevent fuze detonation until external conditions are consistent with the intended arming environment conditions. <br />&bull; Fuzes that can respond to post-release instructions from the aircraft. Of interest would be a fuze that could disarm, disable, or self-destruct after it has already armed based on input from the aircraft or other external source. <br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons.

<p>The General Service Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gather information from commercial organizations, educational institutions and non-profit organizations on new sustainable building technologies and practices in support of its Green Proving Ground (GPG) initiative.</p>
<p>The GPG leverages GSA's real estate portfolio as a "proving ground" to evaluate emerging building technologies and practices that promise to improve the environmental performance of GSA's portfolio while reducing operational costs.  More specifically, the GPG program aims to identify technologies with the greatest potential to help meet GSA's mandated sustainability goals, particularly those contained in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009, "Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance", and assess their performance in the in the real world context of operating buildings.  Notable findings from all projects will support the evolution of performance specifications for the GSA portfolio and will inform decision making at GSA, other federal agencies, and the industry in deploying the technologies studied.</p>
<p>Commercial entities, educational institutions and non-profit organizations  wishing to participate in GSA's GPG 2013 Program, including those who have previously submitted information for past years' programs, must complete the questionnaire at: [http://www.clicktools.com/dashboard/survey/response.jsp]. The GPG Program may review and consider submitted technologies for enhanced Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) as part of the 2013 program.  To be selected, innovative products can be (1) gifted (unconditionally) or (2) provided to GSA for testing through the use of an agreement and a payment of a fee to GSA.  Additional information may subsequently be requested.<br /> <br />Questions about this announcement should be directed to gpg_2013@gsa.gov.  This announcement will remain open until midnight ET on Wednesday, October 31, 2012.   <br />&emsp;<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). Responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form an agreement or binding contract of any nature.

<p>1. STONE MATERIALS SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>a. Each stone piece shall meet the following test requirements for quality:</p>
<p>Test Requirement</p>
<p>(1) Specific Gravity (BSSD) 2.60 minimum.<br />(ASTM C127-88(2001) (CRD-C 107)</p>
<p>(2) Absorption Not more than 3 percent<br />(ASTM C127-88(2001) (CRD-C 107)</p>
<p>(3) Abrasion Not more than 20 percent loss<br />(ASTM C131-96) (CRD-C 117)</p>
<p>(4) Accelerated Expansion<br />(CRD-C 148) Not more than 10 percent breakdown</p>
<p>(5) Magnesium Sulfate Soundness, 5 cycles<br />(ASTM C88-99a) (CRD-C 137) Not more than 10 percent loss</p>
<p>(6) Drop Test No breakage or cracking</p>
<p>b. Laboratory Stone Testing. Previous test results may be requested to verify quality. The following represent test procedures specified recently on Corps projects to determine quality:</p>
<p>(1) Specific Gravity and Absorption: Weight per cubic foot will be determined by multiplying the bulk-saturated-surface-dry specific gravity (BSSD) times 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. Specific gravity and absorption will be determined in accordance with ASTM C127 (Corps of Engineers Testing Procedure CRD-C 107), modified as follows: The test sample will consist of about 5,000 grams of generally cubical pieces of stone passing the 2-inch and retained on the 1-1/2 inch standard square mesh sieve sizes. Test pieces will be laboratory prepared by jaw crushing and chipping. Test method permits a variance in reproduction of test results of 0.02 in BSSD specific gravity and 0.05 percent in percentage of absorption. This variance in specific gravity is equivalent to a variance of plus-or-minus 1.2 pounds per cubic foot in unit weights computed from the specific gravity.</p>
<p>(2) Abrasion: Abrasion loss will be determined in accordance with ASTM C131 (Corps of Engineers Testing Procedure CRD-C 117), modified as follows: Test sample will be of the same size and gradation as that described above for use in determination of specific gravity and absorption, the abrasive charge used will comply with that used in Grading "A", and the test sample will be subjected to 500 revolutions. The standard test method designated ASTM C535 (CRD-C 145) shall not be substituted for ASTM C131.</p>
<p>(3) Accelerated Expansion (15 Days): The test sample will be tested in accordance with Corps of Engineers Testing Procedure CRD-C 148, except as herein specified. Testing procedure for sample size in CRD-C 148 will be modified as follows: The test sample will be from 4,950 grams (10.83 pounds) to 5,050 grams (11.05 pounds) of 1-1/2 inch to 2 inch pieces. Test results will be computed by dividing the number of pieces that breakdown by the number of pieces in the original test sample. Failure or breakdown is defined as any piece separating into two or more pieces or losing sufficient surface material to allow it to pass through the 1-112 inch sieve. Maximum allowable breakdown is 10 percent over a period of 15 days. Weight loss based on the original oven dry weight will be recorded.</p>
<p>(4) Magnesium Sulfate Soundness: The test is based upon ASTM C88 (CRD-C 137). Test sample will be similar to that described above for use in determination of specific gravity and absorption. This test, which will be conducted through five cycles, which requires 2 to 3 weeks time for completion.</p>
<p>c. Physical Stone Testing by Drop Test. A drop test provides an immediate evaluation of the durability of very large stones during handling of the stone including placement into a structure. If requested, several representative test stones shall be dropped from a bucket or by other means from a height of not less than half the average diameter of the stone onto a rigid surface or second stone of comparable size. Dumping from a truck is not acceptable. The stone shall be examined carefully before as well as after the completion of the test. Failure criteria are the development of new cracks, opening of old cracks, and the loss of a piece from the surface of the stone. Each stone that is to be tested shall be dropped a total of five times for evaluation purposes with examination after each drop. The Contractor shall provide all necessary equipment and operating personnel to help perform the testing. Drop tests shall be conducted by the Contractor under the supervision of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>d. Quarry Operations. Quarry operations shall be conducted by the Contractor in a manner that shall produce stone conforming to the requirements specified and may involve selected quarrying, handling, processing, blending, and loading as necessary. Blasting and handling of rock shall be controlled by the Contractor to produce rock of the size ranges and quality specified. Techniques such as the use of proper hole diameter, hole depth, hole angle, burden, and spacing distances, types and distribution of explosives, delay intervals and sequence, removal of muck piles between each shot, and special handling techniques are required as necessary to produce the specified materials. All aspects of blasting operations shall be specifically designed so that the end product is not damaged from the blasting technique and that the stone is suitable for the intended purpose.</p>

<CONTACT>John R. Travers, Contract Specialist, Phone 2523356933, Email john.r.travers@uscg.mil
<DESC>BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates fourteen HC-144A aircraft. The HC-144A is manufactured by Airbus Military (formerly EADS CASA) based in Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN-235M aircraft provides the foundation for the HC-144A. Changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft. End state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. Certain structures of the aircraft are constructed from glass fiber, reinforced plastic, Aramid Fiber, carbon fiber, honeycomb sections, and poly vinyl protection films such as TEDALAR&reg;. In addition non-carbon panels are protected from lightening strikes utilizing a wire embedded mesh, or the application of anti-static paint.
<p>These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in that they support the Coast Guard Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, as well as surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. USCG HC-144A missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.</p>

<DESC><p>The decision to use a Sole-Source contract to Tremco Incorporated to meet this requirement was based on the fact that Tremco Incorporated is the Contractor who performed the initial roof construction and who owns the current maintenance and material warranty for building 722 and 1284. The amount of the storm damage is out of scope of the work covered by the maintenance warranty, and the warranty would be voided if another contractor works on the two facilities. Additionally, voided warranties are an average cost of $50K per roof. Based on the above findings, it is decided that it would be in the best interest of the Government to sole source this requirement to Tremco Incorporated.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to issue a sole source purchase order using Simplified<br />Acquisition Procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 to Joyce Dayton Corporation for a Bowl Jack Assembly. The Bowl Jack Assembly must match the existing system that is now in place. Joyce Dayton Corp is the manufacture of the other two systems and all parts and must be interchangeable in order for this system to work correctly. It would not be cost prohibitive for the government to redesign this system.<br />Any purchase order will be awarded under other than full and open competition as authorized by FAR 13.106-1(b) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). This is not a request for offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements. Telephone requests or inquiries WILL NOT be accepted.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7025-00-NIB-0004<br />Name:		Mouse, Optical Sensor, Black and Grey, Ergonomic shaped<br />Description:	Hard-wired mouse connects to USB port. Mouse is black with optical sensor and 3 buttons (two navigation buttons and rubber scroll button). UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7025-00-NIB-0004<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	Kensington ProFit 72355</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 6, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Jamaica Bay Science and Resilience Center City of New York and National Park Service Request for Expressions of Interest 
Q&A 	October 10, 2012
Please note that responses are due by 5:00 pm on November 2, 2012. Responses and further questions should be submitted to JamaicaBayRFEI@HappoldConsulting.com. 

Q:  How will this effort be connected to the other projects underway for the Jamaica Bay parklands?  
A: Several other projects are under consideration for the Jamaica Bay parklands, at a similar stage of envisioning as the science center; we are developing ideas, evaluating partners, and considering feasibility. Many of these possible future projects are being assessed through the National Park Service's General Management Plan (GMP) process. Unlike the science and resilience center - which can be established under the existing GMP - many of the other potential projects, such as a wetlands education center, will not proceed until the new GMP is finalized by fall of 2013. The partners selected to develop and operate the science center will be made aware of any opportunities for future collaborations (such as the wetlands education center) and other projects as they move forward. 

Q:  When will the RFP be released?  
A: A decision about an RFP will be made based upon an evaluation of the proposals. A formal RFP may or may not be released, depending on the responses received during the RFEI process.  NPS and the City will evaluate the groups that express interest, and evaluate potential partnerships among respondents.  After responses have been reviewed, NPS and the City will make a decision on whether to issue a formal RFP or engage in more informal conversations with one or more potential partners.  Therefore, we strongly encourage all parties interested in developing and coordinating all or portions of the new center to submit Proposals in response to this RFEI.

Q:  In considering our responses to the RFEI, are you looking for more emphasis on what skills the partners would provide, or what research questions we would prioritize, or how much funding we would bring to the institute?  
A: A wide variety of expertise and resources will be required in the establishment of the new science and resilience center. We will review all submissions against the evaluation criteria, including but not limited to financial support, expertise in appropriate research areas, institutional expertise and management capacity in developing and coordinating all or portions of the new center. The RFEI is purposely open-ended to allow respondents to identify their own strengths, and let us know what they would be able to bring to a potential partnership. 

Q:  Should responses include proposed budgets?  
A:  As noted in the RFEI, responses should include a list of potential funding sources that would support the proposed partnership structure, including assumptions, precedents, and financial comparables as applicable. In addition, these projections should indicate what support, if any, your organization would ask of the public agency partners and what direct support you will be able to provide.

Q: Can you share the list of participants for the September site visit?
A: Yes, the names are provided below as a means of examining potential partnerships in order to establish the new center as a collaborative, world class institution.  We believe it is likely that the entity which ultimately operates the new center will include some combination of different institutions that bring different specializations to the effort.

Q&A 	September 10, 2012

Q:  What types of partnerships are envisioned, and what kind of roles would these partners undertake? 
A: The creation of the new center will ultimately incorporate partners who collectively bring a range of expertise in a variety of complementary areas, including (but not limited to) management and organizational expertise, marine and estuary research capabilities, wetlands ecosystem restoration experience/expertise, and climate change and resilience research and modeling. At the outset we are looking for institutions or groups which have strong track records in one or more of these areas and can work together under the umbrella of the center.  

Q: Can different functions, for example education and community engagement, be split among different parties? 
A: Yes; it is possible that different organizations will undertake different specialties, or multiple organizations could divide these responsibilities based on the expertise and experience of each. As a hypothetical example, a successful team might consist of an institution of higher education that has existing international expertise with marine research in other parts of the world and a local civic organization with an existing network of "citizen scientists" in New York City. Even as different components of the partnership may bring different functional strengths, it is expected that those efforts will be fused into a cohesive and mutually-supportive program. 

Q:  Is it anticipated that partners would bring their own project-specific resources to work at the new center? 
A: One premise of the center is that as the federal and city governments are the sponsoring organizations, both would endeavor to channel and better coordinate their existing research and restoration initiatives via the center. A similar premise would apply to other entities involved in the partnership: that they would see mutual benefit in bringing existing projects and related resources to the center.  Clearly, significant additional resources will be required, and it is expected that partner institutions will be responsible for identifying and securing funding streams to support their research and programming. At this time, no government funding has been identified for this project.  However a number of potential philanthropic donors have expressed interest in the ongoing work around the Bay.   

Q:  Once the partner(s) are selected and an organization is established, how quickly can research activities and other programming begin?  
A: It is anticipated that research activities can begin once a legal contractual relationship exists.   

Q:  Would the new science institute be housed in an existing structure near the Bay, or would a new facility be constructed specifically for the Science and Resilience Center and its partners? 
A:  Existing structures at Floyd Bennett Field and/or Fort Tilden could be rehabilitated for use.  New construction is also a possibility.  

Q&A 	August 10, 2012


 Organizational structure: 
Q: Are you looking for someone to set up logistics and coordinate others' research, or to initiate its own research? 
A: We are looking for all of the above, and are open to a variety of organizational structures.

Q: How much analytical research is expected to be done entirely on site, or, conversely, to what extent could this Center function as a "field" station for an institution whose major labs and highly specialized technical equipment are located elsewhere?
A: We are open to any type of operational structure and invite creative proposals.

Q: Has a scientific advisory board or group been established? 
A: No scientific advisory board has been established. However, we would anticipate exploring the creation of a board with the new partner entity.

Q: Will existing research in the bay continue independently, or be integrated into the work of the new entity? 
A: We make no assumptions as to existing research. While we do not anticipate that all organizations and individuals currently working in the bay will participate in the activities of the center, the goal of the center is to monitor, track and coordinate efforts to the greatest extent possible in order to maximize funding and leverage available opportunities.

Q: In the RFEI, what entities are considered 'public' and 'private' sector? Does 'public' refer to government (City, Federal) only? I work at a 'public' university. I'm thinking, given the examples for partnership structures that we would be considered part of the 'private' sector. (Scripps is connected to a public university, for example.)
A: The public sector refers to the public agencies involved in the creation of the institute. The "private partner" could be, among others, a private or public educational institution or a non-profit organization, as well as individuals, and private or public companies.

1.	Financial: 
Q: What is the budget/funding stream for the center?
A: Funding for the center will likely come from a variety of sources, including grants and philanthropic contributions. We have been approached by funders who are interested in potentially contributing to the establishment and ongoing support of the center, but who do not have the capacity to operate the institution. In addition to any resources provided by a private or non-profit partner, because most research being done today is grant-supported we assume that will continue; however we are exploring other public funding mechanisms.  One premise of the center is its ability to better leverage the significant public and academic expenditures already being made in the basin today. In addition, the NPS is expecting to fund some staff and administrative support for educational activities and community outreach related to the research and science program.

Q: Is there a pre-determined/preferred business model? (long-term grant funding, public-private partnership, other?) 
A: All business models will be considered.

Q: What is being spent on research, monitoring and restoration in Jamaica Bay now by all parties?
A: Since 2002, the Bloomberg Administration has invested over one billion dollars to improve water quality, enhance parklands, and restore natural areas in the Jamaica Bay area. In the next ten years, the City is poised to invest an additional half billion dollars to continue to improve the environmental quality of the Bay. 
In the last five years, the Army Corps of Engineers has managed and provided the majority of funding for a series of wetland restoration projects in Jamaica Bay at Gerritsen Creek in Marine Park and at the salt marsh islands of Elders East and West, Yellow Bar, Black Wall, and Rulers Bar. These projects, totaling nearly $60 million, have been conducted in collaboration with and utilizing funding from the City, NPS, the State Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Port Authority. More specifically, in Jamaica Bay during 2012, about $20 million is being spent on restoration, $6 million is being spent on monitoring, and about $1 million is being spent on research.  
More than 99% of the restoration funding comes from government agencies.  Monitoring is funded about 60% by government agencies, 30% by grants through universities, and 10% from volunteered time by amateurs and professionals.   Research is funded about 30% by government agencies, 65% by grants through universities, and 5% by volunteer professionals.

Q: Will the existing Jamaica Bay Institute budget still be available to support this new center?
A: See the first response in 2 above; this reflects the current NPS Jamaica Bay Institute budget. 

2.	Project Logistics: 
Q: What is the timeline expected for post-RFEI and the establishment of the organization?
A: Timing depends on the nature of responses and interest.

3.	Science and research: 
Q: What are the research projects currently underway in Jamaica Bay? 
A:  A wide range of scientists and academics are conducting research projects in Jamaica Bay. Examples of projects underway include: Sediment nitrogen cycling (Baruch College CUNY); sea level rise (NPS, the NYC Mayor's Office, & Columbia University); eelgrass and oyster experimental restoration (NYCDEP, Cornell Cooperative Extension & NPS); bathymetry of Jamaica Bay (Stony Brook SUNY); and use of ribbed mussels for water quality enhancement, converting algae to biofuel, and building green infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff and reduce combined sewer overflows (NYCDECP).
Monitoring projects presently underway in Jamaica Bay include: Water circulation and retention modeling (NYCDEP); salt marsh restoration monitoring (USACE & NPS); effects of contaminants on fishes and invertebrates (Stony Brook SUNY & College of Staten Island CUNY); triggers of phytoplankton blooms (Stony Brook SUNY); Horseshoe Crab nesting areas (NYSDEC, NPS, & Cornell University); Harbor Herons nest colonies (NYC Audubon & NPS); and Diamondback Terrapins (Hofstra University & NPS).
Information about research projects by NPS, other government agencies, and academic institutions can be found at the Jamaica Bay Research and Management Information Network at: http://nbii-nin.ciesin.columbia.edu/jamaicabay/index.jsp. Additional background materials and presentations on ongoing studies are available at the website for the October 2011 State of the Bay symposium at: http://www.nps.gov/gate/naturescience/stateofthebaysymposium.htm In addition, descriptions of a broad variety of pilot project can be found in the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's Jamaica Bay Watershed Protection Plan Update at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/jamaica_bay/jbwpp_update_10012010.pdf. 

Q: In particular what are the efforts pertaining to nitrogen reduction? 
A: The City is seeking to reduce the nitrogen discharged into Jamaica Bay by nearly 50% over the next 10 years. In February 2010, the City reached an agreement with State DEC, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and other environmental groups to invest $100 million to install new nitrogen control technologies at certain wastewater treatment plants in Jamaica Bay and another $15 million for marshland restoration projects (some of which has already been invested in the Yellow Bar, Black Wall, and Rulers Bar restoration projects). These investments, made in concert with $95 million the City had already committed for nitrogen control upgrades in Jamaica Bay, will significantly improve the health of one of New York City's most valuable ecological areas. 

Q: Is the whole basin a combined sewer area, and how big is the "sewer shed"? 
A: The Jamaica Bay Watershed is 142 square miles, and includes parts of Kings, Queens, and Nassau Counties. The "sewer shed" is only several percent larger. More than two-thirds of the NPS Jamaica Bay Unit is estuarine water and saltmarshes; the other third is uplands. In the past three centuries, urbanization caused Jamaica Bay to lose more than 90% of its saltmarshes and more than 95% of its freshwater wetlands.
Multiple CSO outfalls flow into Jamaica Bay from the combined sewer areas of Paerdegat Basin, Bergen and Thurston Basins, and Jamaica Bay & Tributaries. For CSO area maps, see PlaNYC (page 67 of http://bit.ly/eFy6Xf) and the NYC Green Infrastructure Plan (starting on page 65 of http://on.nyc.gov/9U8ZnY). The areas directly upland from the Bay, including most of the Rockaway Peninsula, are served by separate sewers or direct discharge stormwater infrastructure.  For a map of the wastewater treatment plant drainage areas, see page 16 of the NYC Green Infrastructure Plan. 

Q: Is the EPA involved in this effort?
A: Yes, EPA has been involved in several of the meetings leading up to the issuance of this RFEI. 

Q: Will there be a citizen-scientist program? 
A: We would actively encourage the formation of such a program. 

Q: Is there an interest in supporting basic, process level studies? 
A: Yes, but particularly if these studies contribute to the core research agenda defined for the center and also provide the basis for further applied science research and solutions.

Q: What are the expected proportions of: i.	Original research ii.	Monitoring of existing conditions iii.	Outreach and education?
A: The institute's initial emphasis is envisioned to be on research and monitoring in the Bay, with less emphasis on education and outreach. No proportions have been set and we invite creative proposals.
                                                                           END OF ANNOUNCEMENT

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<br />High Frequency (HF) communications systems and radars are in widespread use <br />around the world. Accurate stand-off geolocation and characterization of <br />these sources is difficult because of ionospheric variations, the high noise <br />environment that exists at these frequencies, and ionospheric polarization <br />rotation, multipath induced signal fading, and simultaneous multiple <br />angles-of-arrival.
<p><br />Recent advances in high dynamic range receivers, antenna techniques, <br />adaptive signal processing, and ionospheric ray path prediction, along with <br />improved measurement and modeling techniques suggest a dramatic improvement <br />in HF reception and geolocation is possible.</p>
<p>The HFGeo Program aims to dramatically improve the ability to geolocate and <br />characterize HF emitters. Required technical innovations include 1) the <br />ability to accurately resolve multiple angles-of-arrival and polarization <br />states through novel antenna concepts , 2) the ability to enhance <br />signal-to-noise ratio and signal detection through the use of <br />multi-dimensional adaptive signal processing, 3) the ability to accurately <br />determine the state of the ionosphere and 4) integration of these component <br />technologies into geolocation and source characterization applications. If <br />successful, HFGeo will deliver rigorously tested technology capable of <br />accurately geolocating and characterizing HF sources.</p>
<p>This BAA is for Phase 1A only to develop new concepts for advanced sensors <br />and signal processing. Subsequent phases may address future challenges, <br />such as ionospheric modeling, integration of these technologies into a <br />prototype system, real-time processing and field demonstrations.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

N00244L332, UNIT PRICES (OCT 2001) (FISC SAN DIEGO)
Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, will be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without further notice to the contractor submitter.  If the Contractor takes issue with the release, it should submit its proposal data with the appropriate legends and explain in detail why such data cannot be released as a public record under the Freedom of Information Act.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors.
 The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Ability to perform per the statement of work
(ii)	Provide the service for the stated period of performance 
(iii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.
 Under this factor, the Government will rate the vendorâ€™s ability to perform per the statement of work as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factor (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate the vendorâ€™s availability to provide the service for the stated period of performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award.
 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.  Ability to perform per the statement of work and provide the service for the stated period of performance, when combined, are equal to price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) The Governmentâ€™s statement of work is attached.  Ability to meet the statement of work shall be demonstrated by the offerorâ€™s submission of a Word document that addresses how they will accomplish all applicable objectives, tasks and guidelines.
  Please submit no more than a 2 page Word document, font size 12, double spaced.      
(c) The Governmentâ€™s period of performance is clearly defined above.  Ability to meet the period of performance shall be demonstrated by the offerorâ€™s submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required date and terms.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerâ€™s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
This announcement will close at 1 PM PST on 26 October 2012.  Submit offers via email to Shannon La Com who can be reached at (T) 619.556.9096 or email Shannon.lacom@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/  .

Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System 
Scope of Work


The Pest Control Service Provider, referred to henceforth as Contractors, agrees to provide the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS), with services stated herein.
GENERAL:
1.	 These specifications cover all labor, material, equipment, and certification necessary to accomplish pest control and eradication in and around the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS), in a pest free environment using a comprehensive integrated pest management (IPM) program.  IPM is a process for achieving long-term, environmentally sound pest suppression through the use of a variety of management practices.  These practices include structural and procedural modifications that reduce pest access, food, moistures and harborage with The SLVHCS.  Chemical methods are applied only on an "as needed" basis.  Need is determined by pest population monitoring and control products are placed where they are inaccessible to patrons, volunteers, and staff of the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SLVHCS).

2.	 Pest to be controlled within the scope of these specifications are, but are not limited to:  cockroaches, ants, flies, bedbugs, fleas(inside), crickets, silverfish, ground beetles, spiders (including black widow) mites, wasps, millipedes, centipedes, caterpillars, rodent, mosquitoes gnats, and other stored product type pest.  The primary focus of this specification is on the exclusion of pests with non-chemical strategies.  The Contractor shall employ the maximum use of EPA approved pesticides ensuring strict compliance with label directions.  The contractor will review all labels on an annual basis and ensure all personnel are trained in their content and application.  

3.	Rodent control shall include the effective control of mice and rats necessary to maintain complete sanitary standards in and around the center parameter.

These materials used in accessible areas shall be confined to EPA approved tamper resistant bait stations that conform to all existing guidelines for construction and installation.

4.	Contractor shall leave copies of label of those pesticides used with the appropriate maintenance designee in case someone is sensitive to the pesticide sprayed.

Contractor personnel must understand current practices in the field and be able to make judgment regarding eradication and application of pesticides.

Copy of license(s) for each shall be furnished with bid submission.

6.	Contractors shall establish treatment schedules for all building and areas to be monitored and strictly adhere to those schedules.  In the event a schedule cannot be met:  8 hours notice will be given and the maintenance designee will be coordinated with to set up as a new date and time.  Secure areas to be entered area to be scheduled through maintenance and times established for treatment shall be followed.  Note:  should a call back be required for treatment not performed in a satisfactory manner it will be at no cost to the SLVHCS.

7.	All services shall be performed during normal work hours, unless special treatments are required.  Should any area require special treatment or evacuation for treatment, a schedule will be coordinated with the maintenance designee and adhered to.  Normal working hours for the majority of the SLVHCS are 0730 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday; however, it is the responsibility of the contract vendor to verify what is the "normal" working hours for the center area for which they have been awarded and to coordinate with the maintenance designee as to the dates/times times that he/she needs to have the services conducted.

1.	 Contractor shall make a thorough initial inspection of the buildings and surrounding grounds to evaluate the pest control needs of each premise.  The Contractor shall identify problem areas and any equipment, structural features or practices that are contributing to pest infestations.
2.	Contractor will set up a pest monitoring program in those areas that contain one or more of the following:  active pest infestation, pest evidence or conducive conditions.  Pest Sighting/Pesticide Application logbook will be established and kept with the COR as part of the monitoring program.
3.	List of proposed materials and equipment:  The Contractor shall provide current labels and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all pesticide products to be used.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation number is SOL-NC-13-00004 and is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP) using FAR Part 15 Negotiated Acquisition Procedures.  This effort will support the US EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: 334511- Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, which has a Small Business Size Standard of 750 employees. The United State Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a contract for the Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED) within NHEERL. Background:  EPA?s Mid-Continent Ecology Division (MED), Duluth MN, of the Office of Research and Development has developed a strategic approach for monitoring the US nearshore of the Great Lakes using towed in situ sensors undulated through the water column and towed parallel to shore along a constant depth contou r for entire lake wide reaches of shoreline.  The towed sensor sampling, presently conducted in late summer, provides high-resolution depiction of the nearshore. MED intends to compliment the towed sensor strategy through the use of Slocum-type glider technology.  The application of this technology will provide high-resolution, regularly repeated grid/transect sampling in selected shallow waters of the Great Lakes.   The glider will be used use to conduct sampling from very nearshore (<20 m depth)  and will focus on waters up to 50 m, but occasionally will be used to sample to at least 200 m water depth.  Sampling will focus on areas directly off river mouths, and will be used to detect and define zones of dilution and mixing of tributary outflow into the Great Lakes and potential biological responses to advection and mixing of waters into the lake.  The EPA desires to use small, relatively portable glider/sensor sensor suites that can be deployed from 20-26 foot vessels, as  well as a larger vessel like the EPA?s  90 foot R/V Lake Explorer. Although glider/sensor technology has not yet been used in this way in the Great Lakes, the EPA expects to deploy it to run repeated regular high?resolution (spatial and temporal) sampling tracks in nearshore plume/receiving areas and couple the nearshore information with watershed export data on flow of water and materials.  PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS/MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SLOCUM GLIDER AND ACCESSORIES: 1)Slocum style glider suitable for the Great Lakes with capability of working in freshwater systems of depths of <20m up to 200m or potentially greater. 2)Sensor payload array consisting of Low power conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) pumped sensor system to support Slocum Glider payload, with additional low power sensors to provide dissolved organic matter (CDOM; 370/460 excitation/emission wavelengths), chlorophyll-a (470/695 excitation/emission wavelengths), particulate matter from backscatter (700 n m), and oxygen (solid state optical detector). 3) Standard Battery pack (Alkaline or equivalent), capable of powering system for extended periods (days to weeks with above sensor suite). 4)Software control system should allow the operator to pre-program and alter the path/flight of the glider. 5)Communications package capable of providing shore based remote control and data download. 6) Handling/Recovery/retrieval system (e.g. cradles/handling attachments, night lights/strobes) should be capable of retrieval under low light/night conditions in addition enable the deployment/retrieval from vessels which have working decks several meters above waterline. 7) Operator/Slocum Pilot training for 1 individual. DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES: 1) Slocum glider and all accessories are due within 6 months of award. The equipment shall be delivered to the EPA Duluth, MN. 2) Operator/Slocum pilot training are due within 12 months of award. The training will be held at the Contra ctor?s facility.

<p>"Registered in the SAM database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>

<p>(2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.</p>
<p>(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.</p>

<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.<br />"Registered in the SAM database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; <br />(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and <br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.<br />"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p><br />252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction applies only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>This Request for Information is being amended as follows:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing date is hereby extended until 4:30PM EST, 03 January 2012.<br />2.&nbsp; Unclassified information available upon request includes: the FMU-139C/B Performance Spec PMA201-03-003A and the FMU-139C/B Fuze Design Control Drawing 3179AS971.<br />3.&nbsp; To provide clarifications and responses to questions received via Attachment 0001 to this posting.<br /><br />Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice is being issued as a Request For Information (RFI). The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (U&amp;W), Precision Strike Weapons Program (PMA-201) is seeking information from industry on innovative concepts for evolutionary improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 electronic tail fuze. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This RFI is intended to be used for market research and technology survey purposes to assist PMA-201 in developing an acquisition strategy for potential future competition. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. <br /><br /><strong>General Description:</strong>The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139 is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to evaluate technologies and identify potential technology insertion opportunities to facilitate an FMU-139 fuze upgrade process through an evolutionary upgrade approach. As a result of this RFI, the Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources in the form of a concept summary paper containing a description of technical data defining proposed upgrade concepts. The concept summary paper shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the concept and development methodology could satisfy below stated requirements. Each concept summary paper should include a top level description of the proposed upgrade concepts, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, scope of development effort, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed concepts including key subsystems, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for the proposed concepts. FMU-139 Fuze upgrade concepts shall address ability to maintain current integration capability with the F/A-18A+/C/D/E/F and the AV-8B fixed wing aircraft. Desired upgrade concepts include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Hardened target capability (threshold = 5,000 PSI target, Objective = 15,000 PSI target). <br />&bull; Serial Data Interface (SDI) technology to enable communication between fuze and aircraft Operational Flight Program.<br />&bull; An in-line or other electronic design. Of special interest would be a design to minimize the number of moving parts and electro-explosive devices in the fuze. Reduction in overall part and assembly counts in the fuze structure and circuit card assemblies with the desired result of improved fuze producability and reliability. <br />&bull; Replacement of current retard and impact sensors with any number of low power sensors including, but not limited to, piezoelectric sensors, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, rolleron devices, and investigation of the sensor designs currently used in the automotive industry. Of special interest would be the speed and consistency of detection timing, as well as producability and reliability improvements.<br />&bull; Detonator Improvements, including the use of a possible replacement material for both the Lead Azide and Lead Styphnate ultimately leading to the qualification of a lead-free detonator.<br />&bull; Front panel switch improvement or replacement, to improve upon the producability, reliability, and aging concerns that have been experienced.<br />&bull; Post-impact intelligent fuzing, allowing for fuze reaction to terminal impact conditions.<br />&bull; Variable output fuzing for initiation of selectable output weapons.<br />&bull; Environmental Sensing concept to prevent fuze detonation until external conditions are consistent with the intended arming environment conditions. <br />&bull; Fuzes that can respond to post-release instructions from the aircraft. Of interest would be a fuze that could disarm, disable, or self-destruct after it has already armed based on input from the aircraft or other external source. <br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons.

The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Executive Office (PEO) Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (U&amp;W), Precision Strike Weapons Program (PMA-201) is seeking information from industry on innovative concepts for evolutionary improvements to the performance characteristics of the FMU-139 electronic tail fuze. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This RFI is intended to be used for market research and technology survey purposes to assist PMA-201 in developing an acquisition strategy for potential future competition. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by responders to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract. <br /><br /><strong>General Description:</strong>The FMU-139 fuze provides warhead initiation for general purpose bomb bodies used in freefall and guided weapons. The FMU-139 is an in-service electro-mechanical fuze with instantaneous and delayed fuze functions. The requirements for FMU-139 fuze capabilities are expanding and many of the technologies utilized in the current FMU-139 configuration are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence and manufacturability. The intent of this effort is to evaluate technologies and identify potential technology insertion opportunities to facilitate an FMU-139 fuze upgrade process through an evolutionary upgrade approach. As a result of this RFI, the Government expects to receive responses from interested, capable and qualified sources in the form of a concept summary paper containing a description of technical data defining proposed upgrade concepts. The concept summary paper shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the concept and development methodology could satisfy below stated requirements. Each concept summary paper should include a top level description of the proposed upgrade concepts, a detailed list of anticipated end product physical and performance characteristics, scope of development effort, anticipated reliability and maintainability characteristics, weapon/aircraft integration/interface concept, design provisions to support incremental upgrades, technology insertion opportunities, an assessment of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed concepts including key subsystems, and a description of the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for the proposed concepts. FMU-139 Fuze upgrade concepts shall address ability to maintain current integration capability with the F/A-18A+/C/D/E/F and the AV-8B fixed wing aircraft. Desired upgrade concepts include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; Hardened target capability (threshold = 5,000 PSI target, Objective = 15,000 PSI target). <br />&bull; Serial Data Interface (SDI) technology to enable communication between fuze and aircraft Operational Flight Program.<br />&bull; An in-line or other electronic design. Of special interest would be a design to minimize the number of moving parts and electro-explosive devices in the fuze. Reduction in overall part and assembly counts in the fuze structure and circuit card assemblies with the desired result of improved fuze producability and reliability. <br />&bull; Replacement of current retard and impact sensors with any number of low power sensors including, but not limited to, piezoelectric sensors, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices, rolleron devices, and investigation of the sensor designs currently used in the automotive industry. Of special interest would be the speed and consistency of detection timing, as well as producability and reliability improvements.<br />&bull; Detonator Improvements, including the use of a possible replacement material for both the Lead Azide and Lead Styphnate ultimately leading to the qualification of a lead-free detonator.<br />&bull; Front panel switch improvement or replacement, to improve upon the producability, reliability, and aging concerns that have been experienced.<br />&bull; Post-impact intelligent fuzing, allowing for fuze reaction to terminal impact conditions.<br />&bull; Variable output fuzing for initiation of selectable output weapons.<br />&bull; Environmental Sensing concept to prevent fuze detonation until external conditions are consistent with the intended arming environment conditions. <br />&bull; Fuzes that can respond to post-release instructions from the aircraft. Of interest would be a fuze that could disarm, disable, or self-destruct after it has already armed based on input from the aircraft or other external source. <br />&bull; FZU-48 alternatives such as higher reliability alternators, alternate airflow systems and release signal generation systems could result in a design more suitable to current and future extended time of fall, high altitude release, and precision guided weapons.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection, and enforcement of its requirements. The NRC's headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and there are a number of other offices around the United States.
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform Design Engineering Inspections. In accordance with the baseline inspection portion of the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP), the NRC inspects the design and operation of nuclear power reactor plants. These inspections sometimes require contractor technical support.</p>
<p>Component Design Bases Inspections (CDBIs) are the primary inspection under this contract. They verify that design bases have been correctly implemented for the selected risk-significant components and that operating procedures and operator actions are consistent with design and licensing bases. This ensures that selected components are capable of performing their safety functions.</p>
<p>In addition to CDBIs, contract technical support may be required for other inspections of design and operations including (but not limited to): fire protection; plant modifications; supplemental inspections at plants which experience degraded performance; reactive inspections (such as augmented inspection teams and special Inspections); independent design verification programs; and integrated design inspections.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the NRC has had various design engineering inspection programs that required contractor assistance to supplement staff resources. These have included integrated design inspections (IDIs), safety system functional inspections (SSFIs), electrical distribution system functional inspections (EDSFIs), service water system operational performance inspections, safety systems design and performance capability (SSDPC), fire protection inspections, and CDBIs.</p>
<p>The NRC has found it beneficial to form inspection teams including contractors with current nuclear plant experience. These inspections usually start with design requirements, and follow the plant implementation through plant operations and maintenance practices.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract. The expected period of performance is a base period of three years with two additional one-year periods.&nbsp; This is a total small business set aside.</p>

The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north.<br /><br />A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length. <br /><br />The BCR relocation scope consists of:<br />Roadway construction, including overpass<br />Tie-in to BCR eastern section<br />Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road<br />Steel casing for future duct bank crossing<br />Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains)<br />Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.)<br />Signs and pavement marking<br />Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs<br />Signalization, as determined by a study<br /><br />Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road. The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side. Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.<br /><br />This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br /><br />NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237310 with a size standard of $33,500,000. <br /><br />PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS: Offerors will be invited to submit a proposal subject to Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements (a PLA proposal), a proposal not subject to PLA requirements, or both.

It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of all potential offerors to monitor the FBO website for any amendments, updates, responses to questions and answers, etc. as the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list. <br /><br />The project location has special security requirements that will be identified in the solicitation.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION TO THE BELOW REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR PROPOSALS TO 3 PM EST NOVEMBER 2, 2012.  

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for Commercial Services.  No proposals are requested by this announcement; all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor. All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned.

Background

The Leadership Veterans Affairs (LVA) 2012 is a year-long corporate leadership development program to develop high-performing leaders. As part of the program, the LVA Innovation Project, a VA-centric pilot program, provides participants with a unique opportunity to define and shape leadership expectations.  As problem solvers of the 21st century, LVA 2012 participants are called upon to utilize innovation and communicate a vision that drives change.  To support organization-wide initiatives LVA 2012 will lay the foundation to participate in the VA's Innovation Initiative (VAi2). 

The VA's Innovation Initiative (VAi2) is a flagship program designed to tap the talent and expertise of individuals both inside and outside government to contribute new ideas that ultimately produce new, innovative solutions that advance VA's ability to meet the challenges of becoming a 21st-century organization.

The LVA  2012 Innovation Task Force on Budget is proposing the development of an interactive Simulated Learning system focused on the Veterans Health Administration budget and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) process that will engage and excite staff at all levels of the organization.  Through this educational tool, VHA staff will develop a better understanding of factors that contribute to a healthier budget and build business acumen based on their Medical Center's strengths and opportunities.  Additional information on the VERA process can be found in the attached "VERA 2012 Patient Class Handbook" (attachment 0001).

Much of the VHA workforce is naÃ¯ve to the complexities of the budget process. While training exists, it is usually targeted only at those staff with direct responsibility for budget and planning.  However, lack of understanding can result in costly but common process errors, such as missed opportunities in vesting, poor documentation, inaccurate coding, and billing errors. The Simulated Budget tool will enable staff in various functions in the organization to simulate actions that impact budget and the VERA allocation process, and experience the outcomes of their decisions through an interactive process, much like a sophisticated video game.  

Requirements

The scope of this work effort is the development, operations, and maintenance of a Simulated Learning tool that addresses the VERA budget allocation process with support for continued enhancements to the application, as determined and approved by the Government.  Please see the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation 2014 Patient Classification Handbook posted.  Additionally, there may be future requirements to address the Veterans Benefit Administration and National Cemetery Administration budget allocation processes.  The Contractor shall perform all activities needed to develop and support the program including: Project Management, application administration and maintenance (to include, but not limited to, defect repairs and regulatory updates to examination templates), end user support, documentation development, and DM&E.  Additionally, the Contractor shall provide support as needed to VA in response to mandates or requirements set forth by the Administration and Congress, specifically related to the tasks referenced below.  

This effort will provide the Department of Veterans Affairs, particularly the VHA, with an interactive training simulator that educates staff on building healthy VHA budgets initially focused on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) process.  Additionally, it will provide immediate feedback on the results from their decisions on the long term ramifications to their VERA budget.   Specifically, this effort will:

"	Develop a translational educational tool for providers and administrative staff using a simulated learning methodology provided on an interactive, electronic "game like" platform.  
"	Develop a Simulated Budget tool will be versatile as both an educational and operational planning tool, and will include modules for clinical, administrative and leadership staff.
"	The Simulated Learning platform will be flexible enough to replicate for any Medical Center Setting, and a variety of other VA environments. 
"	The simulator will be designed in phases as future modules may be developed to address the Veterans Benefit Administration and the National Cemetery Administration budget allocation processes.

Written responses should address the following:

1.	It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above requirement.  In response to this RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information via email to Carol Phelan (carol.phelan@va.gov) by 3PM EST NOVEMBER 2, 2012. 
 
2.	Capabilities/Qualifications - Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possess to perform the work.  

3.	Teaming Arrangements - Description of Teaming Partners, Joint Ventures that your company would consider to perform the work.

If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners certified in VA's VetBiz (www.vip.vetbiz.gov) repository?

5.	Price information - Provide your commercial price history and rough order of magnitude for the same or similar products/solutions.  

6.	Other Market Information - Provide any other relative information, however this information must be included within the 10 page limitation.

This is a request for information and does not obligate the Government in any way, nor does it commit the Government to any specific course of action.  Please address any inquiries in reference to this effort to Carol Phelan (carol.phelan@va.gov) (732-440-9725).

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY<br />Procwing Office: Operational Contracting Division, AFTC/PZIOB, Eglin AFB, FL 32542.<br />Procuring Contracting Officer: Ms. Juanita Paci.<br />Purchase Request Number: FITTAJ2262AOOI<br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br />The purpose of this action is to procure a 400-Hertz Frequency Converter for the Pod Mobile Test Facility (MTF). A new<br />Firm Fixed Price (FFP), single award, contract will be awarded to Unitron LP, 10925 Miller Road, Dallas, TX 75238 (214)<br />340-8600. This procurement is considered an "Urgent and Compelling" need. Due to the long lead time (typically 90 days<br />ARO) this contract must be awarded as soon as possible. The 53 EWG has a critical test that requires the use of the Pod<br />MTF in Jan 2013. This frequency converter must be built, delivered, integrated into the MTF, and fully tested before the<br />MTF can depart for the off-Eglin test site.<br />Ill. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS<br />Under the contemplated contract, Unitron will provide:<br />One (1) each Model No: GFC 37FA, 37.5 kVA vertical mount UFC Series FlatPak 400Hz frequency converter, rated as<br />follows:<br />Input: 208V, 3 phase, 60 Hz with maximum Full Load input current at 99 Amps<br />Output: 11 5/200V, wye, 3 phase, 400 Hz<br />Including the following options:<br />&bull; AP-I Analog Control Panel<br />&bull; B-1 Built-in Maintenance Diagnostic System<br />- S-2 AC Input Safety Disconnect Contactor<br />&bull; T-3 (LV) Alternate AC Input Voltage (208, 220, 240)<br />&bull; TBO Terminal Block Output<br />Frequency converter manual; warranty WPO 1 one-year warranty, parts and labor; and all freight costs (FOB Egli1_1 AFB, FL)<br />IY. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302 (FAR 6.302-l(a)(2)(ii)). Only one responsible source.<br />V&bull; DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE<br />ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF<br />AUTHORITY)<br />As directed by AFI 10-703, the 53d Electronic Warfare Group (53 EWG) performs mission data (MD) reprogramming and<br />testing for the electronic warfare (EW) systems on all Combat Air Forces (CAF) aircraft. That mission includes laboratory,<br />ground-mount, and flight testing. Ground mount testing provides the only capability to perform EW systems' effectiveness<br />testing short of very expensive flight tests. To conduct that portion of the 53 EWG's mission, we operate and maintain a fleet<br />of 5 Mobile Test Facilities (MTFs) that are deployed from Eglin AFB, FL to various test sites throughout the country. These<br />MTFs must be self-sufficient including their own power and environmental control systems. Besides that, each one is<br />uniquely configured to support the EW systems for particular aircraft platfonns. The current 400 Hz frequency converter in<br />the Pod MTF (which is used to support the A-10, F-15, and F-16 EW systems) is inoperative and beyond economical repair.<br />The 53 EWG has recently been directed to conduct an off-site test in Jan 2013 that must use the Pod MTF. Due to the typical<br />90-day lead time for a replace~ent frequency converter, this contract must be awarded as soon as possible. In accordance<br />with FAR 6.302-2, the following issues constitute the determination of exceptional circumstances. Since we use Unitron<br />frequency converters in our test labs and our other MTFs, we require the frequency converter in the Pod MTF to be replaced<br />with the same type so we can maintain commonality. This precludes specialized training for each vendor's equipment and<br />provides interchangeable shop replaceable units (SRUs) that reduce life cycle sustainment costs of all the labs and MTFs.<br />This commonality is crucial since AFI I 0-703 directs that we comply with urgent or emergency MD reprogramming actions<br />within 24-72 hours. A failure of a frequency converter without being able to use parts from another could mean we would<br />not be able to accomplish that mission.<br />VL DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY<br />POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE<br />Procurement procedures identified in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13 will be used. This requirement<br />was not synopsized in FBO lAW 6.302-2 .<br />VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE<br />GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE<br />The Contracting Officer, by signature on the cover page, has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair<br />and reasonable<br />VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS. OR A S'[ATEMENT<br />OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED<br />Alternatives will be aggressively evaluated as they arise. Any new or additional requirements for this type of service will be<br />reviewed for full and open competition.<br />IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN<br />COMfETITION<br />Only one viable source (Unitron LP) is available for this requirement. Per FAR 6.302-l(a}(2)(ii) and 6.302-2, this<br />supply/service required by the Government is available from only one responsible source and no other type of supply/service<br />will satisfy the Government's requirements. Award to any other source would result in:<br />(I) Substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and<br />(2) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements; and<br />(3) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.<br />X. LIS'[ OF SOURCES. IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACOUISITION<br />See Section VI above.<br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS. IF ANY. THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME<br />ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUfPLIES<br />OR SERVICES REQUIRED<br />A separate market survey will be conducted before future acquisitions to determine if other sources have developed or<br />acquired the capability to provide the required services. In the interim, continuing market research will be on-going to<br />monitor other contractor's ability to support this requirement.<br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this<br />document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.<br />~ ~<br />Xm. T.BCBNICALIREOUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel<br />have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, Is both accurate and complete lAW<br />FAR 6.303-2Cb),
