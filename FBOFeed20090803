<DESC><p>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.201(b)(1).</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15. The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Florida State University (FSU). The purpose of the requirement is to determine optimal parameter settings for the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) and the optimal usage of its inline tracer capability for transport and dispersion modeling. The WRF model was developed by various agencies and universities (e.g., the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Penn State University and is considered the United States meteorological community mesoscale model. This research and development will consist of sensitivity studies of both WRF with its tracer capability, and WRF using other transport and dispersion models for comparison. The anticipated period of performance is 24 months from date of award. FSU is the only source known to be capable of fulfilling the government's requirement. FSU has unique experience in long range transport issues, having participated in seven National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) airborne field projects involving the global transport of air pollutants. Locations of those field projects include numerous regions within both hemispheres. This vast experience in performing and analyzing numerical model simulations over various regions of the world is critical to accomplishment of this requirement. This research will answer questions that are very similar to those encountered during the NASA research. FSU prepared various T&amp;D products for each project using a variety of meteorological model output ranging from global models down to the locally run Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5). By viewing the trajectories and comparing them with airborne in situ data, FSU has obtained vast experience in assessing the quality of trajectories and other T&amp;D parameters. Other research projects have given FSU extensive experience in sensitivity studies of additional mesoscale models (e.g., the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) and their applicability to transport and dispersion analyses. FSU has extensive experience with both mesoscale and transport and dispersion models. Finally, the FSU personnel can consult (at no cost) with other inhouse meteorological faculty who also are experts in running the WRF model. The solicitation for this requirement will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP). It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712, with a size standard of 500. Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil). It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling DUN &amp; Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505). This Presolicitation Notice is not a request for competitive quotations. Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Postal Service is seeking Qualification Statements from Design Build Entities wishing to be to be placed on a list of prequalified Design Build Entities for Energy Conservation Projects within the Great Lakes Area of the United States Postal Service. The USPS reserves the right to utilize the prequalification list for projects located anywhere in the geographic boundaries of the Great Lakes Area which includes portions of the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Missouri.  Each specific project will include any energy conservation project for an existing Postal Facility in the range of approximately $200,000 to $5 million.   Only the most qualified Design Build Entities will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of 5 years experience and must have completed a minimum of five comparable design/build projects in the area over the past 5 years. Comparable projects for this solicitation are defined as any Lighting or HVAC system upgrades to commercial or industrial buildings with a construction value of $500,000 or more.  The Design/Build Entitys Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria listed in order of importance: experience (including design) and references, organization, and safety.  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are: background information, backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility, and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue a solicitation (RFP) for each specific project to prequalified firms.  The list of prequalified firms will be based upon project type and location for each specific project.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal. Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations.  The Postal Service retains the right to: (1) Delete from the prequalified list any firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the current Postal Service purchasing policies.  (2)  Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be repaired or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.  (3) Issue open market solicitations for specific projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  The list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review annually.  Qualification Statement packages are available now and may be obtained by sending an email request to USPS Great Lakes Facilities Service Office, Attn: Michelle Rajzer  via email at  michelle.a.rajzer @ usps.gov.   Qualification statements are due by Monday, September 1, 2009 at 3:00 PM CDT if you intend to deliver in person.  If tendering by mail, postmarks no later than September 1, 2009 will be accepted.  The completed Qualification Statement should be delivered via one of the many services provided by the Postal Service or hand delivered to Great Lakes Facilities Service Office, Attn:  Carolynn Arndt, 62 Stratford Drive, Bloomingdale, IL 60117-7000. Qualification statements will not be returned.

The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for Central Alarm monitoring Systems.  
9.  	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:
Rugged ConstructionGreeces Electrical Grid Though Greece has come a long way in upgrading its electrical network, the grid still has significant problems.  The system is no longer isolated, and problems in neighboring developing counties spill over into Greece, such as on July 25, 2007 when problems with the power grid in Balkan countries caused a widespread electricity blackout in Greece.  Additionally, internal network problems are long-standing as shown by the 2004 blackout during the Olympic Games.   Even with the introduction of new power plants to increase production capacity, the existing electrical network is inadequate to absorb the energy being produced.    Embassy residential properties (leased and owned) regularly experience jolts that blow out light bulbs and damage electrical equipment.
The AES 5100 Alarm system is specifically designed for use in countries where there are electrical grid problems.  Each unit includes a super heavy-duty power supply to protect it from the irregular current found in Greece.    The power supply can operate on a wide range of voltages and survive extremes of power fluxuation.  They also include uninterrupted power supplies so the systems stay operational during frequent, one to three hour blackouts.
Compatibility
The AES 5100 integrates seamlessly with the AES 3015 Central Alarm Monitoring Station (CAMS).  AES has over thirty years experience with residential alarms and a proven track record of ensuring compatibility of future models with previous ones, lowering overall costs as components can be recycled between current and future systems.
Other alarm systems may or may not be compatible with the AES CAMS, or with other model CAMS.  A failure of this years model CAMS (regardless of make) may therefore, in the out years, result in the loss of the entire network.  A breakdown of the core system for protecting the Embassys Soft Target residences would place personnel at undue risk in a post rated High for Terrorism, where attacks by domestic terrorist organizations is an almost daily occurrence.   With AES, based upon their history, a CAMS purchase three to six years from now will seamlessly integrate into the overall system reducing costs and decreasing critical system down time.<BR><BR>Standardizing
Standardizing the residential alarm systems used at US Embassy Athens will allow for interchangeable parts, reducing the need to purchase new equipment through cannibalization.  It will reduce training costs as technicians and users can focus on a single system, and reduce storage space costs/requirements as multiple systems will not need to be stored to provide repair parts for multiple alarms.
Company Longevity
One of the primary reasons why the US Embassy in Athens is upgrading all of its alarms is due to the use of three residential alarm systems in the current inventory.  One of these systems, only about five years old, comprises a third of the approximate 195 residences.  However, that system is no longer manufactured and its parts are not compatible with the two other alarm systems.  The problem is reaching crisis levels.  The alarm system is the central protective system for Soft Target residences and the safety of our personnel and their families.  Though the system was purchased in good faith with the belief that the manufacturer would produce it or a like, compatible product in the future, that was just not the case.  AES has been producing quality residential alarm systems for over thirty years.  The longevity of AES indicates it is more likely to be around in ten years so that component parts, or new backward integrating parts, continue to be available.
Upgradeability
The AES-patented InteliNet system creates an integrated, multi-path radio network for alarm signals to reach the CAMS without the need for costly rental or purchase of repeater stations.  Each unit acts as its own repeater.  The signal is passed from one unit to the next along the most direct route back to the CAMS.  If a route is blocked, the system leverages other alarm systems to restructure the communication path so the signal reaches the CAMS.
The InteliNet system works when the telephone lines and internet lines do not.  This is vitally important in an active earthquake zone.  It will continue to work during major security events (such as a building being blown up, a plane crashing, etc) even if the telephone lines are blocked by overstrain on the telephone network.  The InteliNet system is an extremely flexible, self-correcting communication system. 
Post has not obtained the necessary frequency for use of the IntelliNet system but it is RSOs goal to move to a wireless communication alarm system once the frequency hurdle is overcome.  Both the AES CAMS and AES 5100 alarms can be quickly upgraded to provide InteliNet capacity.41 USC 253 (c )(1), FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. AES is the manufacturer of the AES alarm systems, which makes them implicitly qualified and capable of selling their products and explaining how the products work.<BR><BR>

The programelement is entitled, ESSP Venture-class Science Investigations: Earth Venture-1.  Forboth prior postings, the title of the NAIS announcements should have read, Recovery Act- Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences- 2009 and the proper CFDA Numberfor each should have been stated as 43.AAA. All other information provided in the twoESSP Venture-class Science Investigations: Earth Venture-1 announcements (other thanthe NRA/solicitation numbering issue that follows) remains unchanged. All parties areadvised that the electronic posting system used to post NAIS and FBO announcementsrequires that a slight change be made to the ROSES NRA Solicitation Number in order toadd ARRA funded program elements. The ARRA ROSES NRA Solicitation Number isNNH09ZDA001N-1. All Appendices soliciting proposals that will be ARRA funded will beidentified using the number NNH09ZDA001N-1. As such, the new program element ESSPVenture-class Science Investigations: Earth Venture-1 will be added as Amendment #9,Appendix A.39, under NNH09ZDA001N-1.  The Solicitation Number for the original (non-ARRA Funded) ROSES NRA remains asNNH09ZDA001N.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG); plans to procure Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of lung cancer in Genetics and Environment in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, with University of Southern California; Keck School of Medicine; 1441 Eastlake Ave., NOR6420; Los Angeles, CA  90089.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12  Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)(ii) to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial buy.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12.0M.

The purpose of this requirement is to conduct methylation analysis of lung cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples using Illumina Infinium technology allowing over 27,000 CpG measurements per sample for over 14,000 genes.  NCI conducted the EAGLE study to identify the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer with the ultimate goal of improving the prevention and treatment strategies for this fatal disease.  EAGLE includes over 2,100 primary lung cancer cases and 2,100 population-based age-, sex- and residence-matched controls.   This study was designed to include an integrative approach of environmental, genetic, clinical, and behavioral analyses necessary to impact one of the greatest public health problems. 

The University of Southern California and the laboratory of Dr. Ite Laird-Offringa has established expertise in gene hypermethylation analyses, in particular as they occur in different types of lung cancer.  The USC has been conducting DNA hypermethylation assays for over nine years and has developed a process for using paraffin-embedded DNA on the Illumina Infinium platform; the ability to interrogate paraffin-embedded material on the Illumina Infinium platform opens the possibility of obtaining DNA methylation data from large sample collections consisting of paraffin-embedded tissue, as those collected for the EAGLE study.  In addition, the USC has many years of experience in MethyLight analysis, and has developed a  quality control steps preceding Illumina Infinium analysis. The USC is the only source known to the NCI that can provide gene hypermethylation, methylation, and MethyLight analysis from paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed samples for the EAGLE study.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with University of Utah; 75 South 2000 East, 2nd Floor; Salt Lake City, UT 84112-8930 for services regarding assays of telomere length, ribosomal DNA copy number, and mitochondrial DNA / nuclear DNA ratios in molecular epidemiologic studies

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.501. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard $13.5M 

Period of performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.

Telomere Length and ribosomal DNA

Recent studies have demonstrated associations between telomere length and various cancers among which carcinomas of the head and neck, kidney, bladder, lung and NHL. Most of these studies have been small due to throughput limitations of the assays (e.g. southern blod) and relied on relatively large quantities of DNA. However, recently a valid and reliable PCR method has been developed that has a high throughput and requires only small amounts of DNA. This development has opened the way to evaluate the possible relation between telomere length and future cancer risk in several NCI studies to confirm the previous observations and to explore in more detail the relations between exposure, telomere shortening and future cancer risk.  

Telomeres may interact with rDNA in maintaining cell division capability.  High rDNA copy number combined with high telomere length was associated with the highest cancer mortality rate in a Utah population. A hypothesis is that high rDNA copy number facilitates more rapid growth and cell division rates, and longer telomeres allow cells to go through more divisions before cell senescence or apoptosis is triggered, blocking tumor progression. 

Mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA ratio

Mitochondria are the eukaryotic organelles responsible for energy production through the synthesis of ATP. In normal cells, mitochondria have 2-10 copies of their genomes (mtDNA). mtDNA is a circular molecule that lacks introns and protective histones. As a consequence, the mutation rate for mtDNA is 10 times greater than that of nuclear genomic DNA. Further, mitochondria have limited DNA repair capacity and compensate for damage by increasing the number of mtDNA copies, thus mitochondria are more susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS), an important determinant of cancer risk. One functional consequence of ROS damage is the disruption of cellular structural elements, including the lipid membranes of mitochondria. ROS affect mitochondrial function by damaging mtDNA and impairing electron chain transport.  Because mtDNA is in close proximity to the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where electron chain transport occurs, direct oxidative damage to mtDNA is greater than to nuclear DNA. In addition to defenses that scavenge ROS, mitochondria respond to oxidative stress by increasing mtDNA copy number. The ratio fo mtDNA to nuclear DNA (nDNA) has important implications for cancer risk, as individuals with great mtDNA/nDNA ratios have great oxidative damage repair capacities. To date, no epidemiological study has evaluated the ratio of mtDNA/nDNA.

The University of Utah is the only laboratory that currently has operating telomere length, rDNA copy number, and mtDNA/nDNA ratio assays capable of measuring average telomere length, rDNA, and mtDNA/nDNA in DNA using limited amounts of DNA with high-throughput to analyze the needed number of samples. 

Samples will be analyzed in the same lab used for the ATBC study (HHSN261200800649P) since comparability and continuity of scientific results is necessary to complete the mission of the NCI. For these reasons, the University of Utah is the only source known to the NCI to complete the tasks outlined within the procurement.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure on a sole source basis Oncotype Dx Testing Service for TAILORx Trial in Breast Cancer with Genomic Health, Inc. (GHI), 301 Penobscot Drive, Redwood City, CA 94063   <br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)  using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325412 and the business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for one base year with one (1) twelve month option period.</p>
<p>The NCI DCTD provides support to the Clinical Cooperative Groups to conduct a large trial of patients with early stage breast cancer.  The trials will test whether patients with a Recurrence Score between 11-25 as determined by the Oncotype Dx assay will benefit from addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy.  The The Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx) was initiated in late 2005 and has been rapidly accruing patients.  The contractor shall provide Oncotype Dx assay on approximately 4000 patients required to complete enrollment in this important trial.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following:<br />1.   OncotypeDx on all patients who are pre-registered to the TAILORx trial.  The test will be ordered by the treating physician using standard GHI ordering procedure and forms. TAILORx is designed to use the OncotypeDx to select lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients for treatment that will be tailored according to their risk of recurrence, as measured by the test.  There is no other equivalent test.  GHI is the only  CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988) certified laboratory performing the test.Genomic Health, Inc. has carried out the Oncotype Dx Assay on all patients enrolled in the TAILORx Trial to date.  They are the only source for the performance of the Oncotype Dx Assay which they perform in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988) certified laboratory.  GHI's performance has been excellent.  They have achieved assay results on greater than 99% of the patients specimens provided to them.  They have also provided the data back to the physician enrolling the patient on the trial rapidly so that the patients can receive proper treatment in a timely fashion.  <br />The Oncotype Dx assay is a proprietary assay of GHI.  They spent years developing and technically and clinically validating the assay.  The have proprietary nucleic acid probes, reagents and analytical algorithms for determining the risk of node negative breast cancer patients of disease progression.  This is not an off the self assay.  Assays that are being used to make decisions about patient treatment must be technically and clinically validated and must be run in a CLIA certified laboratory.  Only laboratories that have demonstrated proficiency with the assay can perform it in the context of patient management.  Since this is a proprietary assay, no on else can perform the Oncotype Dx assay.</p>
<p>Without support for the performance of the Oncotype Dx Assay by GHI the TAILORx trial with have to be terminated far short of its accrual goals.  Termination of this high profile clinical trial would result in a failure to realize the benefit from the significant investment already made in the trial.  Termination at this time would leave significant uncertainty about the appropriate clinical use of the Oncotype Dx Assay.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This acquisition will be processed
in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part
13.106-1 (b)(1).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The North American Industry
Classification System code for this acquisition is 334516 and the business size
standard is 500 employees.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Laboratory of Pathology,
NCI produces and analyzes tissue microarrays (TMAs). An element of this work is
the performance of immunohistochemical (IHC) assays on TMAs. The application of
automation improves throughput as well as reproducibility of the IHC assay. Acquisition
of an open system automated IHC instrument with customer controlled and defined
bar-codes and high capacity will enable both throughput and tracking. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The salient characteristics for
the required system are as follows: 1. Immuno-histochemical Stainer Robot that
is an Open System - including the following features: a. User programmable, b.
flexibility of reagent choice, c. Does not require the use of liquid over-slip
technology (an issue with TMA staining); 2. Barcode reading enabled with the
following features: a. 2-D bar codes, b. Reads bar codes provided by user
(compared to defined by manufacturer), c. Included bar code reading and
tracking of both slides and reagents, d. 48 slide capacity.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dako North America is the
only company known to the NCI that offers an instrument that meets the above
specifications. Unique elements are the bar-code technologies allowing
integration of user-defined barcoding on specimens and the open platform for
the use of any reagents. The system is such that other assays, including in
situ hybridizations and assays on protein and antibody arrays can be programmed
on the instrument. This system also has continuity and shared platform of
consumables with existing instrument in the NCI laboratory at current time.<span>&nbsp; </span>For consistency of the ongoing research
studies, it is critical that the laboratory maintain its current methodologies
and reagents.<span>&nbsp; </span>The instrument must be
"open", allowing the NCI to use any specified reagents in the current
assays. &nbsp;Any instrument that requires specific reagents for operation does
not provide the capacity to move current assays on to a new system. Any change
in reagents or methods could significantly interfere with ongoing projects, and
potentially require the restaining and analysis of thousands of slides at a
significant expense to the government. </span></p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis analysis to measure genomic  global DNA hypomethylation with Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center; 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21231.
 	
The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $13.5M.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. Period of performance shall be at award through 12 months. 

The purpose of this requirement is to study and evaluate genomic global DNA hypomethylation in relation to colorectal cancer risk measuring LINE 1 promoter hypomethylation.  Recent studies have measured LINE 1 hypomethylation status in genomic DNA using peripheral blood, and correlated hypomethylation status with increased cancer risk.  It is important to confirm or refute previous case-control findings using pre-diagnostic samples such as those collected in the PLCO Trial.

Johns Hopkins University, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center is the only known source, to the NCI, that developed and validated the COMPARE (Combination of methylated DNA precipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes) assay.  This is a highly amenable to high-throughput, 96-well plate analysis and can be used to rapidly determine the quantitative methylation patters and require relatively small amount of input genomic DNA.  This method is required for consistency regarding the ongoing study at JHU.  At the present time, there is no other known laboratory that is equivalent for reasons of assay validity and DNA resource prevention.

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding Oral Bacteria and Risk of Esophageal Squamous Dysplasia with The Forsyth Institute; 140 The Fenway; Boston, MA 02115.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $13.5M.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. Period of performance shall be at award through 11 months. 

The purpose of this requirement is to obtain data on oral bacteria in the esophagus.  Contractor shall measure the presence and relative abundance of oral bacteria species in 850 DNA samples, to assess the association between these species and the risk of esophageal squamous dysplasia, the precursor lesion for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC.  NCI has demonstrated in multiple studies that poor oral health/tooth loss is associated with increased risk of cancers in epidemiologic studies.  The Cytology Sampling Study 2, CSS2, offers a study with appropriate biological samples for the assessment of this potential link.  This study recruited subjects from the general population of Linxian, China, who are at high risk for developing esophageal cancer, and collected questionnaire data and biological samples, including esophageal cell samples.  

The CSS2 study provides one of the only analytical epidemiologic studies of esophageal squamous dysplasia that collected an appropriate biological sample for the estimation of oral bacterial species in the esophagus.  The Forsyth Institute has developed a valid high-throughput method for measuring the presence and relative abundance of oral bacterial species in DNA samples, namely the (Human Oral Microbial Identification Microarray).  Using the HOMIM method, Forsyth can determine the presence and relative abundance of >250 species or strains of oral bacteria in a single DNA aliquot.  This method is required for consistency of the current study in progress.  Forsyth Institute is the only known source that has developed this method required by the NCI study.

<p class="MsoNormal">The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer
Control and Population Services (DCCPS), Health Services and Economics Branch
(HSEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis testing the specimen retrieval system
with Kaiser Permanente Northwest; 1800 Harrison
St., FL 16; Oakland, California 94612-3433.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This acquisition will be processed in accordance with
simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The
North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 the business size
standard is $7.0 Million.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It has been</span> determined by NCI that a large number of clinically
annotated specimens are required for the evaluation of markers and assays for
clinical decision-making, but it is generally not possible to anticipate the
specific needs of the research community, and it is very costly to set up
specimen banks for all the different possible needs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Harvard University has developed a system to
locate and retrieve specimens and pertinent clinical and outcome data on an as
needed (just-in-time) basis from community health care settings and preliminary
performance testing of system has been conducted at Harvard hospitals and two
health maintenance organizations, including Kaiser Permanente Northwest, of the
Kaiser Foundation Research Institute (KPNW/KFRI).<span>&nbsp; </span>Further testing of this system is required to
determine that it can reliably &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; <span>all personal health data (PHI) identifiers while
maintaining usable data extracted from medical records.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>There are several tasks to be performed to accomplish this.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first involves a scaling up of the number
of cases to be analyzed for scrubber performance from 10-50 to 500-1000.<span>&nbsp; </span>A software modification made by the Harvard
programming team in the reports produced by the scrubbing will allow both
individual and summary reports of the items of PHI that have been encountered
in the test.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Problems of
&ldquo;over-scrubbing&rdquo; can then be tabulated and presented for correction if needed,
with a minimum of manual inspection required. The ultimate test of the entire
system &ndash; from defining the search, obtaining records and gathering slides and
blocks to verify that the search produced the correct material and that the
material was usable for laboratory investigators &ndash; will be the principle
activity of the final part of the project.<span>&nbsp; </span>Testing shall be completed within four (4) months from date of award. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">KPNW/KFRI is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort
because of its organization as an HMO and its participation in the Cancer
Research Network (CRN) of the NCI.<span>&nbsp; </span>Additionally, KPNW/KFRI has extensive computerization of its health
records and considerable pathologic resources.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although other members of the CRN have collections of archival specimens
and electronic health records, KPNW/KFRI&rsquo;s will permit the NCI and Harvard to
refine the Specimen Retrieval System.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other sites use different electronic systems so that any difficulties in
expansion might be related to factors other than local record structures.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, the pathology procedures at other
CRN sites had not uniformly used the recommended standard tissue processing.</p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetics Epidemiology Branch (GEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, with Roche Diagnostics Corporation; 9115 Hague Rd.; Indianapolis, IN 46250-0414 for services regarding sample labeling, quality control, C014 hybridization, array scans, data extraction, and segmentation analysis on DNA samples extracted from blood of subjects in melanoma- prone families.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 the business size standard is 500 employees.

The NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetics Epidemiology Branch (GEB) is currently investigating the relation of the CDNK2A gene and its relation as a high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene as identified to date. Although germline CDKN2A mutations are associated with high risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), the penetration of this gene is incomplete and varies by age and geographic location. Further, phenotypic manifestations, such as age at diagnosis, presence/number of dyspiastic nevi (DN), number of melanomas, and co-segregation of pancreatic cancer, vary significantly among mutation carriers even within a single family. 

The period of performance shall be 6 months from the date of award.
The Contractor will compare the copy number changes among mutation carriers to those identified among CMM cases and unaffected family members in CMM-prone families without  known mutations.  Specifically, the lab will perform studies of C011 on whole-genome arrays CHOI 8 Cal 3x720K WO axon-focused to identify copy number changes that segregate with disease traits in CMM families with CDKN2A mutations.  More specifically, genetic DNA including blood samples of 120 subjects from 25 families with CDKN2A mutations to be analyzed for arrayCOH to identify disease-related CNVs. 
Roche Diagnostics Corporation offers the highest resolution array CGH platfoini on the market for analysis of DNA copy number. Unique features of Roche Diagnostics arrays include ultrahigh density and long oligonucleotide probes that provide superior performance and data quality. The tiling-path designs provide comprehensive coverage of both genic and intergenic, regions and are not limited to loci represented by singular nucleopeptide (SNP) arrays. These unique features allow ultra-high resolution detection of small deletions and amplifications as well as breakpoint mapping to gene-level resolution, even in complex regions such as segmental duplication loci. The enhanced sensitivity of long oligonucleotide probes enables better signal-to-noise ratios compared to short probes. Long probes also provide a greater specificity and tolerance for mismatches to detect copy number changes in polymorphic regions of the genome. 
Roche Diagnostics possesses the unique array platform which specifically fits the study design necessary to complete the objectives in this procurement. For these reasons, including the quality products and proprietary data, Roche Diagnostics is the only source known to the NCI to provide the GEB with the necessary supplies and support to complete the studies outlined in this acquisition.

<DESC><p>TITLE:
<p>RECOVERY - IN COMPLICANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMISISTRATION (NOAA), EASTERN REGION ACQUISITION DIVISION (ERAD) IS SEEKING QUOTES FROM A ROOFING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR EXPERIENCED IN VERTICAL WATERPROOFING AND PROPER JOINT REPAIRS TO REPAIR WATER LEAKS, AND PERFORM A TOTAL ROOF AND WALL JOINT INSPECTION TO IDENTIFY AND REPAIR POTENTIAL MOISTURE INFILTRATION AREAS TO PREVENT FUTURE WATER LEAKS CAUSED BY WIND DRIVEN RAIN, MELTING SNOW, AND ANY OTHER FORMS OF POSSIBLE MOISTURE INFILTRATION AT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE (NWS) WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE (WFO) LOCATED AT 6930 SAND LAKE ROAD, ANCHORGE ALASKA 99502.</p>
<p>Work to be performed will consist of the following:</p>
<p>1.0 PURPOSE</p>
<p>RECOVERY- To obtain an independent roofing construction contractor experienced in vertical waterproofing and proper joint repairs to repair water leaks; and perform a total roof and wall joint inspection to identify and repair potential moisture infiltration areas to prevent future water leaks caused by wind driven rain, melting snow, and any other forms of possible moisture infiltration.</p>
<p>2.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT</p>
<p>The Anchorage Weather Forecast Office/River Forecast Center (WFO/RFC) facility located at 6930 Sand Lake Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99502 has incurred water leaks during wind-blown rain events, melting snow, and during moderate to heavy rain events. The roof was surveyed and the field of the roof and the membrane itself do not appear to contribute to the leaks except for one area where a lightning cable penetration was installed after the roof was completed. Most leaks occur between the Exterior Insulation Finishing System (EIFS) and the roof joint and involve cracks around joints and sealant failure. The successful bidder will be expected to repair existing, identified leaks and inspect and repair other potential leak areas.</p>
<p>3.0 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The successful bidder will make repairs to the Anchorage WFO/RFC to fix the existing leaks and inspect the entire structure and repair any additional potential leak areas. The contractor shall confirm the repairs identified in the Anchorage WFO/RFC Roof Leak Investigation and provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI) which include:</p>
<p>1. Remove the insulation and pavers in the SW corner of the east roof and properly repair the damages around the lightning rod penetration. Then re-install the insulation and pavers.</p>
<p>2. Properly seal the EIFS-roof joints and adjacent holes. It is recommended that all EIFS-roof joints be sealed because the mesh and plastic are exposed in most areas. This includes the joint along both sides of the penthouse, the lower-roof and on the small roof above the west and south curtain walls as well.<br />3. Properly repair the cracks in the EIFS finish. A complete visual inspection should be done on the building and all cracks repaired at the same time. This will restore the exterior water-shedding ability of the EIFS to their original levels.</p>
<p>4. Properly repair the sealant joints on the building exterior. A complete visual inspection should be done on the building and all sealant joints repaired at the same time to restore the water-tightness of the building. This would include all metal to EIFS joints as shown in photos 14, 20, 22, and 24-26.</p>
<p>5. Repair the metal closure along the bottom of the curved metal roof by bending the metal back and crimping the edges.</p>
<p>6. Remove the metal fascia, scupper and cap on the west eyebrow roof over the entry and repair any deficiencies found. Reinstall or replace if required.</p>
<p>3.1 Proposal: The successful bidder will be selected based on experience, technical approach to making the repairs, and cost to complete the work.</p>
<p>3.2 Travel: Any costs for travel will be included in the proposal.<br />4.0 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Each potential contractor will be expected to:<br />1. Review the Anchorage WFO/RFC Roof Leak Investigation report and describe methods/processes they will use to make the repairs.<br />2. Provide a description of past projects with similar type repairs.<br />3. Describe the process they will use to inspect the joints and to evaluate other potential leak areas.<br />4. Provide a proposed cost to complete the repairs and do the inspection with a breakdown for each and estimate cost for additional repairs if identified.<br />5. Provide a timeline for when the repairs will be completed.</p>
<p>5.0 DELIVERABLES<br />The successful bidder will:<br />1. Make the repairs identified in the Anchorage WFO/RFC Roof Leak Investigation report.<br />2. Identify and make additional repairs required from their complete inspection.<br />3. Submit a short report once repairs are made including pictures of before and after.<br />4. Submit one invoice for payment upon completion of the work.</p>
<p>6.0 COMMENCEMENT, PROSECUTION AND COMPLETION:<br />The Contractor shall be required to (a) commence work under this task order within 10 days after the date the Contractor receives the notice to proceed, (b) prosecute the work diligently, and (c) complete the entire work ready for use not later than 30 calendar days from date of notice to proceed. The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises.</p>
<p>7.0 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: All work will be inspected by the Government for adherence to the Performance Work Statement. Acceptance will be made upon the Government's determination that all materials and installation passed the Government's inspection as stated above.</p>
<p>8.0 WAGE DETERMINATION: Department of Labor General Wage Determination Number MS20070055 is incorporated into this award. The workers who will be employed in the performance of this contract must be paid in accordance with the Wage Determination. This Determination is issued under the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act.</p>
<p>9.0 WARRANTY: Contractor shall supply a 2 year no-dollar limit (NDL) warranty for the work and all related components. Contractor shall inspect all parts of their work after the first year and make any necessary corrections.</p>
<p>10.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION<br />The contractor will have access to:<br />- National Weather Service, Anchorage Weather Forecast Office/River Forecast Center (WFO/RFC) Roof Leak Investigation<br />- WFO/RFC Anchorage As-Built Drawing</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Technology Maturation (TM) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as an unclassified solicitation to seek proposals for research in support of future development of electronic warfare capability from a tactical-size airborne stand-off/mod-escort platform. 

NGJ is a Department of Defense (DoD) pre-Milestone A (MS A) program to replace the aging ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS).  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to evaluate alternative material solutions completes in early 2010.  

Common Critical Technology Elements (CTEs) appear as building blocks across multiple AoA alternatives, however, many are at Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) less than 6.   The ability to mature these CTEs to TRL 6 (or higher) and integrate them together into a functional system is critical to NGJ's success.  The Government NGJ team desires to reduce future development risk through maturation of CTEs and integration into a relevant TJS concept design.  

In support of this risk reduction, the high-level objectives of this BAA are to:
1.  Provide a system-level Concept Demonstrator (CD) design
2.  Mature critical technologies and subsystems required to support the CD design

NAVAIR will only release the Solicitation, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet. NAVAIR will post the Solicitation on the NAVAIR home page. The Solicitation will not be posted on any other website. The NAVAIR Homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil and can be accessed using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer. To access the NGJ TM Solicitation, select "Doing Business With Us", and then "Open Solicitations" under the heading entitled "Selling Products and Services to NAVAIR." The NGJ TM Solicitation will be listed under N00019-09-R-0238.  Potential offerors are asked to submit comments or questions regarding N00019-09-R-0238 to Ms. Robyn Warner at Robyn.Warner@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>Payroll Modeling Application
<SOLNBR>RS-09-09-325
<CONTACT>Michael Mills, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 492-3621, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email michael.mills@nrc.gov
<DESC>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is seeking to replace its current Salaries and Benefits Payroll Model with a new, more advanced web-based payroll modeling system. The current Salaries and Benefits (S&B) model is operated and managed by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Division of Planning, Budget and Analysis (DPBA).  The NRC is required by the Federal Pay Reform Act to project its budget for the next fiscal year as well as up to five future years.  The budget projections are submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and ultimately to Congress.  Salaries and Benefits constitute more than fifty percent of the NRC Salaries and Expenses appropriation from Congress and approximately 80% of the Inspector General appropriation from Congress.  Errors in the formulation estimates or tracking of this function during budget execution can result in severe resource shortages for the agency.  Over projecting the Agencys S&B requirements can lead to unnecessarily higher fees for licensees and/or restrict the use of funds which could otherwise be applied to program needs.  

Thus, the NRC has a requirement for a more sophisticated, web-based salary and benefits system that would more accurately forecast the NRCs salary and benefit requirements. 

The new payroll modeling system must be able to interface two of NRCs existing systems: (1) PeopleSoft Human Resource Management System (HRMS), Time and Labor (T&L) module; and (2) the Payroll and Human resources modules of the Federal Personnel/Payroll System (FPPS) hosted by the Department of Interior/National Business Center (DOI/NBC).  

The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a comprehensive payroll modeling system to replace the existing Salaries and Benefits Model.  The new payroll modeling system shall be capable of detailed and summary level (Roster based) forecasts of salaries and benefits as well as FTE for current and future fiscal years (up to seven).  Forecasts shall be available daily and refresh bi-weekly when new payroll data becomes available.  The system shall have the ability to capture existing data from our payroll systems during the execution phase, perform forecasts for both formulation and execution purposes, provide statistical data for use in forecasting, and accommodate multiple changes in parameters for scenario analysis purposes.  The system shall allow the OCFO management to plan, modify, and accurately report on actual and projected expenditures for the current fiscal year and up to seven out years.    

This requirement will be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and it is anticipated that the award will be a labor-hour (time & materials) type purchase order.

The period of performance of the resultant purchase order will be three (3) months. The Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be available on or about August 13, 2009, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFQ. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFQ will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity

This proposed procurement is under 100% small business set aside.  The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of 25 million dollars over the past three years as set forth under NAICS 541511.  This requirement is also limited to interested parties that reside within a 50 mile radius of NRC Headquarters located at 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville MD, 20852.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety, Seismic Safety and Handicapped Accessibility.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to the following person and address in writing, via email, or via fax, and provide site address, size and offered square footage, date of space availability, expected rental rate per useable square foot fully-serviced and whether or not the quoted rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.</p>

<DESC>Description of Work for Vancouver Barracks:<BR><BR>Project Name and location: Vancouver Barracks, Vancouver, Washington.  Vancouver Barracks consists of 55.6 acres and is located approximately one-quarter mile north of the Columbia River and immediately east of Interstate 5 in Vancouver, Washington.<BR><BR>Scope of Current Request: The Vancouver Barracks project consists of two sites; the Columbia River Site and the Western Portion Site.   The Columbia River site was a Government pier for the Army from 1849 to 1948.  During WWII, this area was a large shipyard called the Kaiser shipyard.  During that time, munitions were dumped into the Columbia River.  No known unexploded ordnance (UXO) responses have been completed.  The Western Portion site has been used since the original settlement of Vancouver Barracks in the early 1800s, as a strategic military post.  UXO has been found on site during excavations of development and archaeological investigations.  A Closed, Transferring, and Transferred Range/Site Inventory Report and Historical Record Review were completed for the facility and a Site Investigation (SI) for these sites was planned in the Installation Action Plan.  <BR><BR>The primary objective of the Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) SI is to determine whether a project warrants further response action under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act - aka SuperFund) or not. The SI will need to collect the minimum amount of information necessary to make this determination, as well as it (i) determines the potential need for a time critical removal action (ii) collects or develops additional data, as appropriate, for Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and (iii) collects data, as appropriate, to characterize the release for effective and rapid initiation of the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS).  Additional objectives of the MMRP SI are to collect the additional data necessary to (i) complete the Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol (MRSPP); and (ii) develop a more refined cost-to-complete (CTC) estimate.<BR><BR>Key Design Resources Required:  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Safety Expert with underwater diving experience, and underwater geophysics expertise.<BR>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Request for Information</strong></p>
<p>The 827ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is requesting information on Internal Cargo Lighting for the KC-135 R/T model aircraft.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry for options of internal cargo lighting for the USAF KC-135 R/T aircraft.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic aero medical Evacuation (AE) missions. Cargo compartment lighting on this aircraft is inadequate for efficient patient care by AE crewmembers (AECM). Poor illumination, especially for litter patients, makes clinical assessment and treatment very difficult. A permanent, non-handheld light source capable of AE patient illumination by AECMs is required to ensure proper patient assessment and safe patient movement. Zone lighting that eliminates or reduces the potential disturbance of other patients is desired.</p>
<p>In addition, improved cargo compartment lighting should enhance safety, cargo loading/unloading operations (floor/pallet), and passenger carrying and aero-medical mission operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: </strong></p>
<p>The requirements listed below are viewed to be an integral part of any technical solution proposed in response to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All improvements, deviations, and modifications of these requirements should maintain the intent of the original requirement.</p>
<ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="1">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The lighting system should provide visible spectrum light of adequate intensity capable of illuminating the cargo area such that crew are able to fully visualize a litter patient without interfering with patient care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Night vision friendly mode is desirable, but not a requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Night vision compatibility should not significantly impact cost.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">The system will require no modification of main aircraft structure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ancillary structure may be used for hardware attachment.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Some testing required IAW MIL-STD-810 or DO-160.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specific areas of concern include explosive atmosphere, vibration, temperature and shock.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Based on previous light solution implementations, Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology is the preferred light solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fiber optic, incandescent, and fluorescent lighting have undesirable traits which lend these lighting types to be of secondary consideration.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Lighting color should be white with no tint or tinge of other color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is necessary to evaluate patient condition, i.e. body and wound discoloration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be advantageous to include other modes of color; however the primary mode must be pure white.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Light intensity is subjective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Light should be of adequate intensity to perform all mission operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any quantification or qualification of lighting should include foot candle measurement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>References should be included, i.e. OSHA, AMA, etc.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Lighting should be focused on cargo or pallet interior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Use of reflectors and diffusers should be documented as well as the impact on intensity.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Lighting solution should be a permanent installation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consideration should be given to ease of installation and maintenance.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Lighting equipment must not interfere with mission operations, i.e. cargo loading.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">The current aero medical mission utilizes three patient support pallets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A zone lighting concept is preferred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At a minimum, this should involve one zone per pallet and one zone for the boom area for a total of four zones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The entire cargo area should be covered by this area, beginning with the galley/latrine area and ending at the boom area.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Lighting controls should be easily accessed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lighting controls should be placed in the galley area and at the forward edge of each patient support pallet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The forward lighting control should be able to control each lighting zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This control should be able to turn all lights on and off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The lighting controls at each pallet should be able to turn the lights on and off for the corresponding pallet zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This allows patients at one pallet to rest while care is provided to patients on an adjacent pallet. </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">The light solution should provide a dimming feature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This should provide varying degrees of intensity from off to fully illuminated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dimming may be provided in steps or continuous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dimming control should be incorporated into lighting control at each pallet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">OPERATING ENVIRONMENT: </strong></p>
<p>The KC-135 cargo compartment operating temperatures range from below freezing to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. System must be explosion-proof, resistant to vibration, and approved for in-flight use.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS: </strong></p>
<p>Primary power source should be aircraft power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The KC-135 has 115/200 volts AC, 400-hertz, three-phase electrical power, single-phase 28VAC, and 28 VDC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lighting solution should include provisions for operating on the ground with no external or generator power available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The KC-135 has two 28 VDC batteries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dissipated power should be minimized to avoid complete battery discharge.</p>
<p>Lighting controls should be easily accessed and operated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Lighting that is compatible with night vision goggles is not required but is desirable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">TECHNICAL APPROACH:</strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed lighting system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system. If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged. Briefly address all potential risks. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Describe the type of training that will be required to operate the proposed system. Briefly summarize how personnel would operate the system.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>COMPATIBILITY </strong></p>
<p>Explain system compatibility. Describe any limitations.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING</strong></p>
<p>State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">COST</strong></p>
<p>Provide the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SSN99159KR

Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Implementation Technical Assistance


1.	 BACKGROUND

The process of implementing alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) into the general public requires a broad ability to educate and inform potential buyers; provide technical assistance to businesses involved in different aspects of vehicle use, fuel supply, or vehicle maintenance services; and identification and removal of roadblocks in the implementation and utilization processes. This must be accomplished while maintaining focus on the Department of Energy (DOE) objectives of reducing imported petroleum use and decreasing vehicle emissions. The National Renewable Energy Laboratorys (NRELs) objective is to maintain and enhance these capabilities through increased interaction with the AFV industry and interested parties.

In support of DOE and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), NREL provides technical expertise in the development and evaluation of existing and emerging alternative fuel vehicles and fueling infrastructure.  In addition, NREL arranges and conducts meetings of key AFV industry stakeholders that help motivate the implementation of alternative fuels and the infrastructure necessary to enhance the utilization of these fuels.

2.	OBJECTIVE

NREL seeks to identify potential sources that possess the technical expertise and ability to provide technical assistance to NREL in support of NRELs mission to assist with the deployment of alternative fuel vehicles.  The selected subcontractor will perform tasks that are related to the development, deployment, and support of alternative fuel vehicle and fueling infrastructure projects.

3.	POTENTIAL TASK AREAS

3.1	Codes and Standards (C&S) Participation  As authorized by NREL, a potential subcontractor would be required to participate in C&S committees to maintain existing and develop new standards that impact the utilization of alternative fuels in transportation vehicles and fueling stations. These C&S organizations may include:

	American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
	Canadian Standards Association (CSA)
	Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
	National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
	International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 

3.2	C&S Planning  A potential subcontractor would define a multi-year, coordinated effort to address C&S for alternative fuels.  Activities might require analyzing existing C&S, performing a gap analysis, and creating a plan to develop new C&S.  Additionally, the potential subcontractor would be responsible for updating the multi-year plan as the market for alternative fuels or related technology develops.

3.3	Natural Gas Transit Users Group (TUG) Meeting  A potential subcontractor would organize and implement approximately one meeting per calendar year of the Natural Gas Transit Users Group to be held at a transit agency site, in eastern or western U.S. locations.  NREL may authorize quarterly meetings to be conducted via webcast depending upon industry participation and demands.  In coordination with and subject to NRELs approval, activities might include scheduling the meeting agenda, inviting and preparing presenters, generating an invitee list, sending out invitations, arranging for meeting rooms, and identifying appropriate accommodations for out-of-town participants.  Attending the meetings in conjunction with the NREL Technical Monitor or other NREL designee would be required for non web-based meetings.  Preparation of summary reports of the meeting proceedings would also be required, submitted to NREL within 10 working days of each meeting.

3.4	TUG Newsletter  In conjunction with the NREL Technical Monitor, a potential subcontractor would prepare a quarterly Natural Gas Transit Users Group Newsletter to be distributed via email to the list of interested parties and transit stakeholders.

3.5	Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Forum (NGVTF) Meeting  A potential subcontractor would assist NREL with planning and facilitating meetings of the NGVTF, an organization that supports the development and deployment of commercially competitive natural gas engines, vehicles, and infrastructure, and provides input into the needs and milestones of NRELs natural gas vehicle technology programs. NGVTF meetings take place annually, but may be schedule for up to two times per year, as directed by the NREL Technical Monitor.

3.6	NGVTF and TUG Stakeholder Interaction  A potential subcontractor would interact with stakeholders and interested parties on a regular basis between formal meetings to maintain current information and track industry needs.

3.7	AFV Incident Investigation  A potential subcontractor would conduct on-site incident investigations involving AFVs.  Activities would range from coordinating investigation efforts with local authorities and involved parties, to evaluating incident data, analyzing and interpreting findings, constructing failure mode theories, and publishing results.

<DESC><p>Notice of Intent<br />Ref# 2009-Q-11627
<p><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, intents to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 6.302(1), using simplified acquisition procedures, to BaseCase GmbH, ATC Steinhof 4.OG, Bahnhofstrasse 28, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland for a period of 3 months.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform a formal cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective to establish the costs and health effects of the chest x-ray (CXR) component of the screening algorithm for active tuberculosis (TB), that is currently used by the isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) trial in Botswana and write a report with recommendations to BOTUSA, and submit a paper of this analysis to a high impact peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>This study will inform policy makers on the incremental costs and health effects of the addition of CXR screening to an IPT screening algorithm. Additional screening with CXR at the end of the current IPT screening algorithm is expected to result in a higher number of true positive findings of active TB. Excluding more patients with active TB (CXR true positives) from an IPT program will lead to cost savings within the IPT program and also lower rates of isoniazid (INH) resistant TB. Subsequent treatment of the additional active TB cases detected will result in lower morbidity and mortality. However, CXR screening also results in CXR false positives. Excluding these patients will lead to cost savings within IPT, but is also expected to lead to a higher incidence of TB (because of not being on IPT), that will in turn result in higher morbidity and mortality. Another consequence is that exclusion of patients from the IPT program, will decrease the probability of getting access to HIV care. Not starting IPT will also prevent INH adverse events.</p>
<p>BaseCase GmbH is a health economics consultancy firm, specialized in the field of infectious diseases. A cooperation with University of Groningen, Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy (GRIP), Groningen, Netherlands has existed since 2003, and has been strengthened in recent years with joint publications on the cost-effectiveness of Tipranavir (a protease inhibitor used in salvage HAART), the cost of HIV/AIDS care in Italy, universal infant pneumococcal vaccination in the Netherlands, and MRSA screening at hospital admission [2, 12-14]. An economic evaluation of the national IPT program of Botswana as part of the IPT evaluation panel has recently been performed. The overview of IPT resource use items produced as part of this evaluation will serve as a starting point for this study.</p>
<p>No Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Any interested companies are welcome to submit there credentials and ability to provide the services, via e-mail, ibi9@cdc.gov. Include reference number (2009-Q-11627). Send responses by Friday August 7, 2009.</p>
<p>This advertisement ends in 5 days accordance with FAR 5.203 (A) (1).</p>

<CONTACT>Gretchen T. Clohessy, Contracting Officer, Email eoddrfi@dtra.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Electronic Environmental and Device Characterization

The Combating Terrorism Division (RD-CXC) of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting government, industry, and academia for high quality, innovative, and relevant advanced technologies capable of providing electronic environment and device characterization to support and supplement the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) communitys Render Safe Procedure (RSP) protocols.

Objectives of Electronic Environmental and Device Characterization

There are situations where an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) may be in a place in which its detonation is unacceptable.  There are a range of novel technologies that may be useful in preventing the remote detonation of the device.  The objectives of this task are to understand the electrical nature of the device and its environment to allow EOD operators to make a rational decision on the next appropriate RSP action.  The most preferred approach is to passively detect, identify, and map the environment, electronic components and circuitry within and near the device without changing its state.

The objectives below relate to the effectiveness, selectivity, and understanding of passively and actively detecting and mapping the electronic environment and the circuitry within target devices:
1.	Develop technologies that passively characterize the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum from 6 MHz to 6 GHz.
2.	Develop technologies that passively detect and map an explosive device (with or without power applied to the devices circuitry) without changing its state.
3.	Develop technologies that actively detect and map an explosive device (with or without power applied to the devices circuitry) without changing its state.
4.	Develop technologies to do the above described characterization that are vehicle-portable or, preferably, man-portable.

Environmental and Device Characterization: Directly related to objectives 1 and 4, above.  EOD operators must accurately ascertain all relevant radiofrequency (RF) energy in the operational environment as well as all RF energy entering and being emitted from the device.  A successful proof of concept consists of a detailed RF spectrum analysis of: 1) the operational environment, and 2) the explosive device.  Environmental characterization requires technologies that deliver near perfect RF information about the environment and the device to include its internal components, their layout, and their status, i.e. charged, armed, etc.

Passive Electronic Circuit and Component Detection: Directly related to objectives 2 and 4, above.  RD-CXC seeks technologies capable of passively detecting, identifying, and mapping electronic components and circuitry within a target device without changing the state of the device.  The detection and mapping system should be transportable in a standard convoy escort vehicle or, preferably, man-portable.

Active Electronic Circuit and Component Detection: Directly related to objectives 3 and 4, above.  RD-CXC seeks technologies capable of actively detecting, identifying, and mapping electronic components and circuitry within a target device without changing the state of the device.  The detection and mapping system should be transportable in a standard convoy escort vehicle or, preferably, man-portable.

CXC is most interested in government, industry, or academic entities that will have and maintain responsibility for the design, development, and assembly and/or fabrication of relevant technologies.

Responders to the RFI may choose to address any or all of the listed objectives.  Additionally, the risk that related supporting technologies are immature or incapable of allowing successful demonstration and deployment should be addressed.  Approaches that require significant basic or applied research (i.e. RDT&E categories 6.1 and 6.2) are not desired.

Responses shall be limited to no more than 10 pages, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.  Responses should include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) technology concept(s) and associated performances, cost, and risk parameters; (b) respondents stated assumptions; (c) technology maturity and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs); (d) cost drivers (not Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), but activities identified to consume the majority of cost and labor resources), and (e) any other programmatic and technical information respondents deem necessary to aid the government in its program planning, decision making, and execution.  Also include information such as:  Company name, address, e-mail, telephone number, points of contact, CAGE code, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS).  

Upon review of all submissions in response to this RFI, DTRA may schedule individual meetings with any or all respondents to gain further understanding into their specific responses.

Responses shall be submitted no later than 5:00 PM EST on Friday, 2 October 2009 to DTRA, EOD Device Defeat at EODDRFI@DTRA.MIL  .  All responses shall be transmitted electronically.    Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft office software applications.

Additional Information: There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this RFI.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary.  This RFI is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available and requests for the same will be disregarded.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Notice for Request for Information (RFI) No. DOL099RI20762
<p>The United States Department of Labor is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement entitled "Site Exposure Matrices" (SEM) for the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC), Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), and Employment Standards Administration (ESA). This procurement will involve the maintenance and updating of a comprehensive relational database containing information on occupational exposures to toxic substances at all covered major DOE facilities and covered uranium sites. This database, called the Site Exposure Matrices (SEM) database, is used by Claims Examiners as a tool to evaluate causation for claims filed under Part E of the EEOICPA. The database also provides information to the public on the toxic substances found at the covered DOE and DOE contractor facilities.</p>
<p>The current SEM database must be maintained for the existing DOE sites and the uranium mines, mills, and ore transporters. New sources of information as they are identified must also be used to enhance existing SEM data such as occupations at covered DOE sites, building/area numbers (and site-specific aliases) where particular work processes were conducted and the toxic substances present at such sites relative to processes and labor categories. New information submitted via the public SEM database site must be comprehensively addressed and responded to in a timely fashion</p>
<p>A qualified Project Medical Consultant who has extensive knowledge of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Haz-Map database must be retained by the prospective contractor throughout the period of performance. The Project Medical Consultant shall evaluate the toxic substances of concern to the DEEOIC for inclusion in the NLM Haz-Map database. The SEM database must then be updated in a timely manner to include the new information and ensure the information contained in the SEM database remains consistent with the NLM Haz-Map database.</p>
<p>A qualified and experienced database administrator must ensure the security, secured access, and availability of the SEM databases used by DEEOIC personnel and the public. Software and hardware necessary to support the databases must be maintained and periodically evaluated for functionality and security.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or about September 15, 2009, and will be distributed solely to interested parties. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for registration is www.ccr.gov. All qualified vendors including small businesses are invited to participate in this Request for Information.</p>
<p>Interested contractors responding to this Request for Information (RFI No. DOL099RI20762) will be required to indicate their ability to fulfill the requirements that are stipulated below:</p>
<p>1. SEM Database Maintenance - maintain Government-provided hardware and software used to provide DEEOIC claims personnel with access to the SEM database for the purposes of developing claims and to provide information to the public.<br />2. SEM Database Security - ensure that the SEM database accessed by DEEOIC personnel is password protected, implements security features to ensure access only by authorized users, features self-diagnostics and automatic back ups, provides for a minimum of six month's data storage and saves 30 days worth of transactions for review if needed.<br />3. SEM Database Updates - perform updates to the SEM database when new information becomes available.<br />4. Retain a qualified Project Medical Consultant who has extensive knowledge of the NLM Haz-Map database and can evaluate the toxic substances of concern to the DEEOIC.<br />5. SEM Data Quality - implement and maintain a program for ensuring the quality of the data collected and uploaded to the SEM database.<br />6. Research - provide research support to DEEOIC for SEM-related matters, to include researching information required to respond to Governmental and public inquiries, drafting responses to inquiries, review of medical and scientific literature for changes that may have an impact on the SEM database, Industrial Hygiene (IH) review of toxic substance exposure as it relates to employment at covered DOE facilities.<br />7. SEM Training - conduct annual training on the use of the SEM database for DEEOIC claims personnel at six locations: the four District Offices, the National Office FAB, and other DEEOIC staff at the National Office<br />8. SEM Library - collect, maintain, and secure a library of the source documents collected for the SEM database.<br /><br />All interested parties who can provide the listed services are invited to submit in writing, no later than August 17, 2009, 11:00 a.m., eastern time, a package entitled, "Statement of Qualifications/Capabilities Statement" (which must include contractors' indication of their ability to fulfill requirements stated herein).

<DESC><p>Short Term Detention Project</p>
<p>Request for Information</p>
<p>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFTD) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI). This is not a solicitation announcement and no solicitation is currently available. This RFI does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing any submission in response to this notice. Travel costs will not be paid.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, OFDT may need the ability to provide short term detention facilities in support of law enforcement operations (both immigration and criminal) in any area of the country where existing detention space is either not available or appropriate. OFDT is conducting market research to determine what options exist for establishing, activating, and operating short term detention facilities. There is a reasonable probability that these facilities would need to be deactivated and dismantled after the operational need ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The number of detainees at facility could range from as few as 100 to as many as several thousand. Average detainee length of stay could vary from less than a week to six months or more. Advance notice for the establishment and activation of a facility could vary from a few weeks to a several months. The facility design would need to be matched to the detained population likely to be generated by the law enforcement operation. Detainees could be criminal or non-criminal administrative immigration cases, minimum to maximum security criminal cases or a combination of all.</p>
<p>The type of physical structures might include, but would not limited to, modular units made from a variety of materials, existing buildings that have been temporarily reconfigured, and stretched membrane structures. Infrastructure, including land and buildings, might be furnished by the government or might need to be provided by the vendor. Facilities would need to be established, activated and operated in compliance with appropriate OFDT and/or ICE performance based detention standards. Operators would need to have enough cleared and trained staff to activate facilities on potentially short notice. Innovative, cost effective solutions for addressing this need are encouraged as well as suggestions on what would be the most cost effective business model for the government.</p>
<p>Parties interested in responding to this notice may do so in writing or in person at an individual meeting. The contents of written submission and the results of in-person discussions will be kept confidential and will not be shared with other respondents.</p>
<p>Parties wishing to submit written responses should send them no later than September 25, 2009 to:</p>
<p>Gary Mead<br />Senior Advisor/OFDT<br />Suite 910<br />4601 North Fairfax Drive<br />Arlington, VA 20530</p>
<p>In-person meetings will be restricted to 2 representatives per company and will be limited to 2 hours. The meetings will be held September 28- October 2, 2009. Parties interested in scheduling a meeting should email Gary Mead no later than September 23, 2009 at gary.mead@usdoj.gov. Questions can also be submitted to him at the same email address.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to extend the current contracts (W911S0-04-D-0002 and W911S0-04-D-0003) with CALIBRE Systems, and PARSONS Infrastructure Technology, Inc on a sole source basis for a base period of seven months and three one month options.  These two contractors are supporting the integration and standardization of the Range and Training Land Program (RTLP) and the Integrated Training Area Management (ITAM) program and are used to integrate the facilities management, environmental management, munitions management, and safety programs to ensure sustained availability and accessibility of the Armys live-fire training ranges and maneuver training lands. The sole source extension will allow these two contractors to maintain the current support services across the various installations throughout the United States in order to maintain the availability and accessibility of the training ranges until the follow-on contracts are awarded.  These two contractors have established support at various training sites throughout the United States (i.e., Ft Bliss, TX; Ft Benning, GA; Ft Hood, TX; Ft Irwin, CA; Ft Eustis, VA; Ft Bragg, NC).  The contractors are currently providing services across the 50 states and maintain a level of integration between RTLP and ITAM that is necessary for smooth continuity of operations within the Sustainable Range Program.  No award will be made solely on the basis of this notice since a synopsis of intent to place an order cannot be considered a request for proposals/offers-- Responses to this notice will be used to determine whether bonafide competition exists and whether a request for proposal is appropriate.  No solicitation/quote documents exists and no telephone inquires will be accepted--written responses, if applicable, prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the requirement, must be received by this office within 6 calendar days after this notice -- If no affirmative responses are received within this time to determine that a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available, task orders will be placed with the above named vendors.  A request for proposal will not be considered an affirmative response.

<p>3) Conduct Phase II Assessment<br />The contractor shall conduct Phase II site assessment field work of the subject properties to determine the nature and extent of contamination. Sampling will be conducted as specified in the SQAP and TM direction. All sampling will be compliant with EPA Region 10 procedures.</p>
<p>4) Evaluation of Cleanup Options<br />If Phase II sampling indicates levels of contaminants that exceed the specified cleanup standards, the contractor should identify possible cleanup options and cost estimates for site remediation for those areas. This information will be included in the TBA report.</p>
<p>5) Report preparation. Prepare a TBA report. This task includes data management, GIS analysis and data validation. Respond to EPA comments on the report, and as appropriate, other stakeholders.

<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.

Although the Agency' s START contracts were awarded as ID/IQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p><br />1) Scoping/Planning<br />The contractor shall attend a scoping meeting and site visit, prepare a sampling strategy including a sampling diagram with proposed sampling locations; once approved, the contractor will then prepare a Sampling and Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) this is compliant with EPA Region 10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />2) Conduct Phase I Assessment <br />The contractor shall provide limited due diligence support to ensure that the Brownfields Environmental Assessment already conducted by the SITC conforms with EPA's "All Appropriate Inquiry" rule.</p>
<p><br />3) Conduct Phase II Assessment<br />The contractor shall conduct Phase II site assessment field work of the subject properties to determine the nature and extent of contamination. Sampling will be conducted as specified in the SQAP and TM direction. All sampling will be compliant with EPA Region 10 procedures.</p>
<p><br />4) Evaluation of Cleanup Options<br />If Phase II sampling indicates levels of contaminants that exceed the specified cleanup standards, the contractor should identify possible cleanup options and cost estimates for site remediation for those areas. This information will be included in the TBA report.</p>
<p><br />5) Report preparation. Prepare a TBA report. This task includes data management, GIS analysis and data validation. Respond to EPA comments on the report, and as appropriate, other stakeholders. The contractor should also be prepared to provide an advanced copy of the data in the form of data tables, sample location map and supporting information if requested to do so by EPA.</p>
<p><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency' s START contracts were awarded as ID/IQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Request for Information<br />HPCMP Network Services</p>
<p>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program Office (HPCMPO) is requesting information for obtaining state-of-the-art Wide Area Networking (WAN) services to support the Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) and users in various technical communities. This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes - - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The HPCMP is chartered to provide high bandwidth wide area networking (WAN) services to enable scientists and engineers at defense laboratories, test centers, universities, and industry sites throughout the United States to use HPCMP computing resources. The network also supports Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation communities throughout the Department of Defense, and other Federal Agencies. The network that links users and high performance systems together today is called the Defense Research &amp; Engineering Network (DREN). HPCMO is seeking the RFI information to assist them in preparing a re-compete requirements package.</p>
<p>Small businesses are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI, in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, competition and technical capability to provide the required services within the Small Business community. In addition, this information will also be used to assist DISA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan small business goal percentages.</p>
<p>The current contract provides for digital data transfer services between defined service delivery points (SDPs) that make up the DREN. SDPs are specified in terms of their bandwidth requirements and the physical and transport protocols that they must support. Today, DREN provides both asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and internet protocol (IP) services for video, audio, imaging, and digital data. The current network provides site access to the wide area network at bandwidths from DS3 through OC12. The HPCMP plans to continue to upgrade DREN as technology permits.</p>
<p>Additional information, including the statement of work pertaining to the current DREN is attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are invited to prepare a white paper to address the current DREN Statement of Work and RFI questions. The Government seeks industry comment on the SOW, the overall acquisition strategy, and recommendations for satisfying the HPCMP networking requirements in light of the fact that high-speed technologies are rapidly evolving. Although the Government still has residual investment in ATM, the Government will consider alternative cost-effective approaches for satisfying users and community of interest bandwidth and performance requirements.</p>
<p>Note the following information/instructions:</p>
<p>-- Responses are requested from those sources that can provide the total network or a substantive portion of it. If you cannot provide all network services, you should identify the aspects you can provide. <br />-- Information should be submitted in the form of a "white paper," limited to no more than 50 pages in length.<br />-- Responses shall follow the numbering format of the RFI questions (see below).<br />-- All responses shall include the Company Name, Street Address, City, State, Zip Code, Point of Contact (POC), POC Telephone and Facsimile Numbers, and E-mail address.<br />-- Respondents shall clearly identify sensitive or proprietary material.<br />-- Any material submitted, including the white paper, will not be returned.<br />-- The Government shall not assume any expenses incurred by any of the respondents to this RFI. <br />-- Responses to the RFI shall be submitted as indicated in Paragraph 3 of the Cover Page to this RFI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Request for Information Questions<br />HPCMP Network Services</p>
<p>A. General</p>
<p>A-1. Describe your view of emerging technology over the next 3, 5, and 10 years as it would relate to HPCMP's integrated voice and data, substantial bandwidth, and high performance requirements.</p>
<p>A-2. Do you think the technical approach taken in the referenced SOW is the best approach? If not, what would you propose? Would you propose an evolutionary approach? If so, how would you migrate to state-of-the-art technologies as the technologies become feasible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />B. Comments/Questions on Statement of Work (SOW)<br />Please comment and respond to the questions pertaining to each section of the existing SOW attached.<br />B-1.

<DESC>This is an announcement of a meeting to solicit industry comments; this is not a Request for Proposal. The purpose of the meeting is to determine interest and capabilities of sources for a potential contract to replace the Lower Monumental Downstream Navigation Lock Lift Gate. The Government will not reimburse any costs for participation in the meeting.  Any information submitted in response to this announcement is strictly voluntary.<BR><BR>The Walla Walla District, Walla Walla, Washington will use the meeting to help determine the acquisition strategy for the potential solicitation of the Lower Monumental Downstream Navigation Lock Lift Gate Replacement contract.  The estimated magnitude of construction is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.  Information is requested from sources that have the capability and financial means to perform the requirements of the potential contract.  <BR><BR>Lower Monumental Lock and Dam is located on Snake River approximately 44 miles from Walla Walla in Burbank, WA.  The requirement for Lower Monumental Downstream Navigation Lock Lift Gate Replacement includes steel fabrication of a new gate, demolition of the existing gate, installation of the new gate, and any onsite staging and construction efforts to perform the demolition and installation activities. <BR><BR>The existing Navigational Lock Lift Gate is approximately 88 feet tall and 84 feet wide and approximately 600 tons.  The new gate will have connections that are less prone to fatigue cracking and stringent quality control requirements for the material and fabrication.  The general layout of the gate will likely be similar to the Ice Harbor Lock Downstream Lift Gate with some minor improvements.  Additionally, the new gate will probably be slightly heavier than the existing gate (up to 10%).<BR><BR>As part of the Lift Gate Replacement, the Contractor would have to replace 24- 2  diameter by approximately 172 feet long wire ropes and make modifications to two 10 foot by 10 foot by 40 foot concrete counter weights. Resurfacing of the two gate guide bearing surfaces approximately 88 feet high by 1  feet on the navigation lock wall would also be required.  Access and staging at the site may be restricted due to water and surrounding conditions. <BR><BR> The contemplated contract will be a Firm Fixed Price Request for Proposal. The basic contract period may be 16 months, with three of those months being a major outage of the navigation lock at Lower Monumental for the demolition of the existing gate and installation of the new gate and other necessary features. Due to the large amount of fabrication involved in this project, this notice is being issued under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) codes 237990 and 332312.<BR><BR>There will be two parts to the meeting held by the Walla Walla District.  The first part will be a tour of the site at Lower Monumental Dam.  This will be followed by a general overview of the contemplated project with a brief question and answer period for all participants.  The areas of discussion are addressed on the attached document.  The minutes of the general meeting will be posted for all interested vendors through Federal Business Opportunities.   <BR><BR>Tour of the Site Meeting Date:  August 11, 2009, 12:30 PM to 1:45 PM followed by the General Meeting starting at 2:00 PM.<BR><BR>Location of the Meeting:  Lower Monumental Lock and Dam <BR>Snake River, River Mile 41.6, Washington<BR>United States <BR>Participants who choose to attend by teleconference may phone into the following conference number:<BR><BR>Teleconference number (for general overview meeting only):<BR><BR>Phone Number :	877-867-4413<BR>Participant Pass Code:	371600<BR>Teleconference Time:	2:00 PM (local time)<BR><BR>Access to the Site:<BR><BR>Participants will meet at Lower Monumental Dam, North shore, Guard Station.  <BR><BR>Those planning to attend must register for the site visit at the following website: http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/apps/csvr <BR><BR>Firms must register no later than the day before the site visit. <BR><BR>Site visit attendees must be prepared to give the following information:<BR>(1) Name of company being represented;  <BR>(2) Number of people in the party; and  <BR>(3) The name of each individual planning to attend.  <BR><BR>Each individual must have picture identification on his/her person while at the project site.

Background & Project Overview: 	    The Northern California Health Care System,Martinez Ca property is a combination of general office space, a modified high bay storage area, and a mixed content storage area. Per NFPA 13, occupancies, which are decidedly not Extra Hazard or Light Hazard, should be considered Ordinary Group 2. Extra Hazard occupancies provide the most severe fire conditions and challenges to sprinkler systems. EH occupancies include those utilizing hydraulic machinery, flammable and combustible liquids, or where gases or fine dust are present or being stored. Severe obstructions (non-structural) to ceiling sprinkler discharge, which may keep water from reaching all areas in the coverage region, also contributes to EH conditions. By classifying acceptable usage in this narrative, this facility could prevent and mitigate these types of occurrences and save on the design and material cost associated with having to meet Extra Hazard protection requirements. Intuitively, the facility appeared to be housing remedial and transient storage, thus causing it to not be classified as Light Hazard. Because of the unknown type, supervision and length of storage it appears that the greatest value to this facility is to classify it as Ordinary Hazard.B.	General Intent :  The intent of this project is to provide all labor, materials, equipment and services required for complete installation of a new fire protection sprinkler system in Building 29 at McClellan Park and other associated work. The NAICS Code for this construction project is 238220 with Small Business Size Standard of $33.5 million.  The magnitude of construction for this requirement is between $100,000 and $250,000.

<DESC>           The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with vendors on an open competition basis to procure thirty-eight (38) patternless edgers, one (1) pattern edger and eight (8) frame tracers on behalf of the United States Navy.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by August 17, 2009.  The technical documentation will be compared to the minimum essential characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below.  

Essential Characteristics:  

The requirement is for thirty-eight (38) dry cutting three-axis Patternless Edgers with the ability to process CR-39, Polycarbonate, Hi-Index, and Trivex lens materials.  The dry cutting is accomplished by blades that cut the lens instead of grinding, thereby allowing for a tighter fit and better interface with the groove of the frame.  The unit shall have a vacuum system to remove debris and shall not require the use of coolants which eliminates the need for environmental disposal.  The unit shall utilize a 20mm diameter cutter which provides superior bevel reproduction on high base curves which allows for accurate edging of many complex shapes.  The unit shall have an electric chucking system that can automatically adjust clamping pressure depending on the lens material and automatically move the lens into working position. The unit shall have a modular design that isolates the electronics and the cutter motor from the cutting chamber. The unit shall have an adjustable color flat panel LCD screen utilizing a PC-Based Windows like format for user-friendly interfacing with the machine. The unit shall be fully compliant with current OMA standards. The unit shall have an edger resident database which permits adding and editing frame information as well as the capability to download databases. The unit shall have a user-friendly interface that offers a help screen for maintenance functions and operating instructions. The unit shall be ergonomic with easy-access doors for maintenance. The unit shall be shipped complete with vacuum system and accessory kit.  The electrical requirements are 110-120VAC, 60 Hz.

The requirement is for a dry cutting pattern edger with the ability to process CR-39, Polycarbonate and Hi-Index lens materials.  The unit shall be capable of cutting all shapes, sizes and powers of lenses without changing cutters.  Dry cutting shall be accomplished by blades that cut the lens instead of grinding, thereby allowing for a tighter fit and better interface with the groove of the frame.  The unit shall have a vacuum system to remove debris and shall not require the use of coolants which eliminates the need for environmental disposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34. Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations supplement (DFARs) can be accessed on the Internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. This solicitation has no set-aside. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541614. This solicitation will end on 14 August 2009, at 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time.<BR><BR>Quotes shall reference solicitation # W9112J2-09-T-0004 and shall include pricing as follows: <BR>Period of Performance (POP): Will commence upon date of award and continue for 6-8 months. <BR><BR>The Wisconsin Army National Guard would like to increase accuracy and reduce labor costs related to their property book management process.  Although the initial focus is on IM Assets, the vendor solution will provide the infrastructure to support the entire property book. This is the first phase and baseline for inventory automation.<BR>NGWI currently uses a manual process to reconcile assets using the PBUSE system.  PBUSE is the Army's web-based, state-of-the-art, Combat Service Support property accountability system. PBUSE stands for Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced.  PBUSE tracks an assets location and serial number and keeps track of all the current assets owned by NGWI.  The current process involves reconciling using a hard copy spreadsheet of all assets and their location.  The hardcopy list is taken to each location and each asset is verified for that location.  The process is extremely time consuming and completed once per quarter.<BR>The selected vendor will propose a solution to automate our inventory management.  The solution must receive inventory data from PBUSE, report actual found inventory based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and reconciles the data to provide a report of missing assets, assets in incorrect locations, or assets not listed in the PBUSE data base.  <BR><BR>CLIN 0001<BR>RFID software and hardware including handheld readers, fixed readers and RFID inventory and location tags<BR><BR>CLIN 0002<BR>Program product that provides base software that provides a process and workflow backbone and is scalable to accommodate future expansion. This software will provide the foundation for the RFID Solution and provide the integration platform for all major components of the solution. This software will be procured under a license agreement with the vendor.<BR>The base software must be able to receive a feed from the PBUSE property book software, populate a database instance automatically from this data, and reconcile this data including location of all assets to actual inventory results.<BR>The base software must provide a browser-based GUI interface, which supports both Internet Explorer and Mozilla-based browsers running under Windows and linux workstation environments.   <BR>  <BR>CLIN 0003<BR>The program extensions to the base software to be included in this SOW are: <BR>1.	Entry-level Reconciliation:  This Extension is used to facilitate the reconciliation processing to provide the information necessary to quickly and efficiently update PBUSE.  Every single individual PBUSE record must be accounted for.   Reports must be provided showing all NGWI assets, and where they are in the reconciliation process.<BR>2.	RFID Inventory Reconciliation  This Extension will reconcile inputs from two sources:  PBUSE, and RFID-based inventory.  It will compare the 2 inputs and generate output which containing the full list of compared inventory items with their status and any resultant exception information.  The exceptions status details will be provided, identifying every asset in PBUSE as belonging to one of three categories:  <BR>"	In PBUSE but not in RFID database (not located during inventory)<BR>"	In RFID database but not in PBUSE (a new asset; PBUSE updates are lagging), and <BR>"	Location Different (the asset was located, but not where it was expected, and PBUSE needs to be updated accordingly). <BR>A WIARNG operator will be able to export reconciliation results in a .csv file for use in a spreadsheet or report.<BR>The inputs will be file-based output of PBUSE and the RFID inventory, and the outputs will be similarly file-based (.csv files).  However, the comparison operations should be handled accurately and quickly using a database comparison engine.  <BR><BR>CLIN 0004<BR>The labor required to install, implement, and integrate the Solution, including the RFID hardware and software, base workflow software, automated reconciliation and reporting extensions.<BR>The labor must be cleared to at least TS/SCI level for on-site PBUSE design, integration, and testing.  This includes the assigned IT architect, integration and coding skills, and follow-on support personnel on-site, and working with sensitive PBUSE records.  <BR><BR>CLIN 0005<BR>RFID Tags.  The following quantities will be provided as an estimate based on current information.   Additional quantities may be ordered or adjusted as needed.<BR>Tag Type	Tag Quantity<BR>	Phase 1	Phase 2<BR>ABS Encased Asset Tags for laptops, TV's Monitors (.75 in. x 3.0 in.)	750	2500<BR>ABS Small Asset Tags for blade servers, small laptops, telephones, etc	750	2500<BR>Rubber Stick Tag with adhesives for desktops, servers, and larger metal assets	500	1000<BR>Poly Label with foam backer adhesive for non-metal large assets 	150	700<BR>Location Tags for Metal jam, cinder block, wood or drywall doorways.  These tags are scanned for the location information of scanned inventory assets.  	100	500<BR><BR><BR>CLIN 0006<BR>RFID Readers<BR>Handheld = 21 Total to be distributed 1 per Bn, 1 per Bde HQ and as noted.  Range will be 4 feet or less.<BR>JFHQ		2<BR>DOM		1<BR>MATES	1<BR>USPFO	1<BR>426		1<BR>32d IBCT	7<BR>157 MEB	4<BR>64 TC		4<BR><BR>Fixed Readers	:  4 each.  The fixed-read zones will not require any motion or optical sensors, nor will they have any light stack, read out, or display triggered by the reader. Range will be less than 8 feet.<BR>The fixed readers must be integrated into the operation, so that if an item is moved past the fixed readers (such as when deploying a new PC from storage), the RFID-based inventory records for that piece are updated automatically, for later reconciliation with PBUSE.  <BR>A report of Fixed-Reader changes must be made available, as a .csv file, highlighting all of the fixed-reader inventory changes since the last reconciliation, so that a designated NGWI operator can assess PBUSE implications at anytime prior to the quarterly reconciliation efforts, and updated PBUSE in advance of the inventory based on the fixed-reader changes.  <BR><BR><BR>CLIN 0007<BR>Verification, configuration and installation.  We will select 20 items for testing.  10 critical and 10 secondary items to be tagged and tested to verify the system works as designed prior to installation.  RFID and supporting software will be configured to work with PBUSE, and on the WIARNG network prior to installation.  Installation will be a 3 phase operation with initial phase being at the JFHQ, Madison, WI to tag and identify all IT equipment within that HQ.  Phase II will encompass the DOM (including MATES and CSMS), the USPFO, 32d IBCT HQ at Camp Douglas and Fort McCoy.  Phase 3 will include all armories, AASFs, and FMS Shops in the WIARNG.  Cleared individuals of at least TS/SCI clearance will be available to assist with each phase of the deployment and testing.   <BR><BR>CLIN 0008<BR>During Solution Verification, vendor will train WIARNG on the operation and administration of the installed Solution.   This will be hands-on train the trainer training completed for each Phase for up to 3 management and 3 staff users, allowing WIARNG personnel to train others.  Training will include complete documentation and development of a Standing Operating Procedure that may be modified at the will of the WIARNG.<BR><BR>CLIN 0009<BR>Vendor will provide on-site technical support during the first inventory, with TS/SCI cleared individuals.  Vendor will review training with staff and management as needed, review the completed process, and document any issues or process changes that may be required.   This support will be provided at the end of each Phase of this Solution, and at the end of the installation.  Documentation of issues or process changes or of no issues or requirements for process changes will be provided.<BR>TS/SCI cleared vendor individuals will review .csv file reports with WIARNG Property Book personnel to confirm applicability to PBUSE updates.        <BR><BR>CLIN 0010<BR>Maintenance provides support for the following components of this Solution. <BR>1.	RFID Software  for 1 year  included in preliminary purchase price<BR>2.	Other Extension Software  for 1 year  also included in preliminary purchase price<BR>Beyond the first year, submitting pricing must include 3-years Service on the RFID Hand-Held Readers, provided by vendor or manufacturer.  This service includes normal wear and tear, as well as coverage for internal and external components damaged through accidental breakage.   The terms of this Service and incremental year-2/year-3 will be described in detail by the vendor.  <BR>This maintenance plan may be amended by mutual agreement between NGWI and vendor to cover additional WIARNG locations or functions that may be added to the Solution software by vendor and WIARNG agreement.<BR>The software support covered under this maintenance includes problem identification and resolution, responses to customer questions, and correction of code defects.<BR><BR>CLIN 0011<BR>Additional Training.  Vendor will provide a price for additional 2-day education sessions for WIARNG personnel.  Training will include all hardcopy delivered materials, and hands-on training with the system, to bridge from manual-inventory Property Book methods, to the new RFID-based Property Book system.  <BR>Training must be available on-site at WIARNG facilities, or provided at a vendor facility if the needs of WIARNG require it.  <BR>Training must be available from instructors cleared to at least TS/SCI level.  Training should facilitate correct use of the system, for improved ease-of-use in maintaining the accuracy of the PBUSE Property Book system.   <BR><BR>CLIN 0012<BR>Contractor Manpower Reporting<BR><BR>Contractor shall submit their quote on company letterhead, provide solicitation number, the time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers, name, address, and telephone number of the offeror, CLIN price, an overall total price.

52.204-11  AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACTREPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009)
	(a) Definitions. As used in this clause 
Contract, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 
First-tier subcontract means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 
Jobs created means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
Jobs retained means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
Total compensation means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractors past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): 
(1) Salary and bonus. 
(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. 
(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 
(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 
(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. 
(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. 
(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. 
(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 
(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at   www.FederalReporting.gov. 
(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. 
(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the governments on-line reporting tool. 
(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. 
(4) Program or project title, if any. 
(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. 
(6) An assessment of the contractors progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. 
(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractors workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide 
(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractors existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and 
(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. 
(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if

(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. 
(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items under simplified acquisiiton requirements and prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.602, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a total small business set-aside.

This solicitation number is HHSN1108672KH and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35. Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland and Baltimore, Maryland (see Various Place of Performance). 

The National Institute of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), has a requirement for a Teaching Genetic Counseling Supervisor. 

Genetic Counseling Supervision is taught as an interactive process intended to monitor the quality of client care, improve clinical skills, and facilitate professional and personal growth of the genetic counseling students. The contractor will provide professional supervision to students enrolled in the Genetic Counseling Graduate Program. The sessions will address the students counseling learning objectives and how well their clinical casework is meeting those objectives.  The students will be graded on a pass/fail basis that is outlined for them in a supervision consent document. This work will be completed May 31, 2010.  

Contractor Requirements

Professional supervision involves meeting with seven students weekly for one hour throughout the academic year. A typical supervision session will include an oral case presentation by the student supported by audiotape segments of casework highlighting issues related to learning contract goals.  The contractor will also review brief written case notes.  Students have the opportunity to ask questions, explore alternative interventions, discuss/discover counter-transference themes, address ethical concerns, and receive feedback and suggestions on their therapeutic interventions. 
Formal evaluations of the students clinical casework will be conducted at the end of each term.  Evaluation criteria will be based on self-assessment through oral and written case reports, discussion of at least three audiotaped segments of counseling sessions (or role plays) each quarter, exploration of two partial case transcripts each quarter, and the degree to which the student accomplishes the goals set forth in the learning contract.  Students can expect potential benefits of supervision to include improvement of their counseling conceptualization and intervention skills and an increased sense of professional identity. In addition to a grade (P/F) students will receive a complete supervision summary at the end of the year that outlines their work and accomplishments. The course is taught over four 8-week (for a total of 32 weeks) terms extending over the academic year from 8/21/09-5/31/10.

Additionally, the contractor will teach a concurrent Self-Awareness course as part of the supervision requirements of the Genetic Counseling Program. The course will consist of 4 sessions to take place in the first term, between 08/21/09 to 10/21/09. 

Government Responsibilities

NHGRI will supply the meeting rooms for supervision to occur either on the JHU campus or the NIH campus of the program.  The Program Director will review student progress with the instructor on a quarterly basis or more frequently if students are encountering difficulties.  The Program Director will submit the grades from the contractor-taught course. 

Period of Performance: 

August 21, 2009 to May 31, 2010.

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables

Supervision reports will be verbally summarized for The Program Director at the end of each term.  The contractor will keep supervision notes throughout the academic year to be used to compile the written summary at the end of the academic year.  A pass or fail grade will be given to the Director by e-mail correspondence at the end of each term.
 
Program Management and Control Requirements: N/A

Inspection and Acceptance Requirements

Since services will be delivered on the JHU School of Public Health campus or the NIH campus used by the Genetic Counseling Program, inspection of the site and circumstances will take place at one of these locations.  The site will be inspected for a comfortable setting for the student to present her casework and sufficient room for the contractor to be able to take notes and listen to audiotapes in a confidential manner.  The Program Director will inspect the setting and accept the site according to this criteria. The format for the written supervision summary will be shared with the contractor and will be required as a final document completing the four term course series.  Verbal summaries at the end of each quarter on individual student progress will be required.  

Cost Basis
32 weeks of hourly supervision for 5 students 
16 weeks of hourly supervision for 2 students (to graduate in January 2010) 
4-session series (2 hours each) of Self-Awareness Training 

Past Performance Criteria: 

Each Offeror shall provide past performance references for existing and prior contracts of similar size, scope, and complexity. The evaluation of past performance will consist of a qualitative assessment of the Offerors demonstrated success in the performance of previous and/or ongoing contracts of similar size, scope, and complexity to the requirement of this solicitation. Evaluation of past performance will be based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The Government will evaluate the relevance of the cited past performance reference information to the requirements stated in this solicitation as well as the quality of the Offerors past performance and determine each Offerors probability of success on the proposed contract based upon this record of past performance.  The Government will seek to determine whether an Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable cost/prices. The Government shall make an assessment of the Offerors past performance, taking into account (but not limited to) such aspects as: Quality of Past Teaching Experience based on student evaluations, Quality of Past Supervision Experience, both in preparation and student-to-student face time, based on student evaluations and reported hours, Cost Control and Timeliness of Performance. In assessing an Offerors past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the Offeror and may consider information from other sources such as, but not limited to information contained in Government past performance databases. Each reference will be evaluated separately, as described above, and an overall rating will be given to the Offeror. For cited references, the Government will make only 2 attempts to contact a relevant reference for obtaining past performance information. 

The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.

<RESPDATE>081409
<CONTACT>Timothy Wampler, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-441-6563, Fax 757-441-3786, Email Timothy.Wampler@noaa.gov - Brendon J Johnson, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-441-3344, Fax 757-664-3644, Email brendon.johnson@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Ecosystem Survey Branch and the Cooperative Research Program of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a priority research project relative to Northeast fisheries.<br />The research will emphasize industry based fishery independent trawl survey practices that will assist in filling data gaps relative to flatfish stock assessments. The vessel shall be involved in conducting a trawl net sweep comparison study and biological sampling of flatfish populations throughout their range in U.S. waters in Southern New England. The purpose of the sampling will be (1) to conduct experimental work to estimate net efficiency for each net used in the survey for a range of depths and habitat types and (2) to provide biological sampling opportunities. This project will evaluate flatfish catchability of a Bigelow 4-seam net with rock hopper and cookie sweeps across the range of suitable flatfish habitats. While winter flounder is a priority, the survey project will broadly address flatfish catchability, and will be directed by NEFSC staff. The project will involve a twin trawling vessel equipped with two net reels. Southern New England flatfish habitat will be targeted, especially near shore strata sampled by the MA, RI, and NEAMAP inshore surveys. Winter, summer and yellowtail flounder catch rates and size composition will be compared across habitat types and with inshore and offshore surveys. Results will inform discussions on the need for a dedicated flatfish survey in the future. A twin trawl experiment is considered an efficient mechanism for comparative tows. With the nets side by side, an estimated 15-20 days of trawling are likely to be required to achieve the desired 80 paired tows. This project will likely employ different tow durations during tagging opportunities described below.<br />The proposed contract is 100% small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 483112. The small business size standard is 500 employees. The period of performance is one 10-day survey leg during the Fall of 2009 (September) and one 10-day survey leg during the Spring 2010 (February-March). The solicitation and proposed fixed price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors 1 - 4, listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Vessel characteristics and configuration (2) Vessel's commercial fishing history fishing capability (3) Master's and crew's work experience and qualifications (4)Pertinent vessel documentation including stability letter, marine insurance coverage, and structural survey or insurance inspection and (5) Price. <br />All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov and obtain a DUNS number by calling 1-800-333-0505. Prospective contractors are also required to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required CCR registration. A copy of the solicitation will be attached to this announcement as a downloadable Word file. Quotes will be due on or about August 14, 2009. A hard copy of the solicitation will be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the requestor. Telephone requests for hard copies will not be honored. Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 664-3640.

<DESC>Meeting Design and Facilitation for California Gulch Community Advisory Group:

California Gulch National Priorities List Site consists of about 18 square miles high in Colorados mountains in Lake County, Colorado.  The site includes Leadville, the highest incorporated town in the United States. Mining, mineral processing and smelting activities in the area have produced gold, silver lead and zinc for more than 130 years.  Added to the National Priorities List in 1983, the site cleanup is nearing completion.  Recently, EPA determined that the remedy for one of the 12 operable units (OU), OU 6, is not sustainable and a new cleanup approach is necessary.  The new remedy will entail consolidating and capping a number of mine waste piles, which EPA and the community had initially hoped to preserve for their historic appearance.  Many in the community wish to preserve the historic appearance of the mining district with its many mine waste piles and historic mining structures.  Unfortunately, these waste piles are the source of much of the metals-contaminated snowmelt and rain runoff that ultimately contaminates the headwaters of the Arkansas River.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 12 August 2009, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 12 August 2009. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR CHECKPOINT APPLIANCES
<p>This acquisition is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5. This solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.</p>
<p>All offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential quoter to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to keith.bubar@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), to provide several CheckPoint brand name appliances and subscriptions, along with the value-added services that coincide with the items. The contractor shall provide all associated parts and subscription services for all line items stated and described in the attached Microsoft Excel list of items to be procured.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with the exception provided for Information Technology Value Added Resellers with a size standard of 150 employees. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 541519. This requirement is being competed as an unrestricted full and open competition whereby authorized resellers will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the items are located in an area only accessed infrequently by maintenance personnel.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION: <br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: <br />52.212-1 <br />52.212-3 <br />52.212-4 <br />52.212-5 Alternate II, including, 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1) and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.203-15 (see full text below), 52.204-11 (see full text below), 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, and 52.232-33. <br />52.203-15 WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (MAR 2009) <br />(a) The Contractor shall post notice of employees rights and remedies for whistleblower protections provided under section 1553 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5). (b) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause including this paragraph (b) in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>52.204-11 AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT-REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Contract", as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. "First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act.<br />"Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. "Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c) (2)): <br />(1) Salary and bonus. <br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. <br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. (4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. <br />(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. <br />(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000.<br />(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. <br />(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. <br />(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov. <br />(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. <br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government's on-line reporting tool.<br />(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. <br />(4) Program or project title, if any. <br />(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. <br />(6) An assessment of the contractor's progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. <br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide- <br />(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and <br />(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. <br />(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if- <br />(i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received- <br />(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. <br />(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act. The contractor shall provide detailed information on these first-tier subcontracts as follows:<br />(i) Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor receiving the award and for the subcontractor's parent company, if the subcontractor has a parent company. <br />(ii) Name of the subcontractor. <br />(iii) Amount of the subcontract award. <br />(iv) Date of the subcontract award. <br />(v) The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. <br />(vi) Funding agency. <br />(vii) A description of the products or services (including construction) being provided under the subcontract, including the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the subcontract.<br />(viii) Subcontract number (the contract number assigned by the prime contractor). <br />(ix) Subcontractor's physical address including street address, city, state, and country.

<p>As indicated in clause 52.212-5, Alternate II:<br />(d)(1) The Comptroller General of the United States, an appropriate Inspector General appointed under section 3 or 8G of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

</p>
<p>52.217-6,&nbsp;Option for Increased Quantity (Mar 1989)
<p>The Government may increase the quantity of supplies called for in the Schedule at the unit price specified. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 days of date of purchase order acceptance by the Contractor. Delivery of the added items shall continue at the same rate as the like items called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The CheckPoint items required by NIST are proprietary and available from only CheckPoint authorized resellers and no other types of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The manufacturer, CheckPoint, is the only manufacturer of products that will meet the agency's needs.<br />This procurement is for eight pairs of CheckPoint firewall appliances and three CheckPoint manager appliances. These appliances will be used within the NIST IT network security infrastructure to upgrade six of the existing firewall pairs, upgrade three of the firewall managers, and extend the infrastructure by adding two new pairs of firewalls. This network security infrastructure includes both the NIST Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO campuses.</p>
</p>
<p>Firewalls are highly customized devices that are integrated into a network infrastructure with extensive security policies defined for each pair. Replacing some of the existing firewall appliances with another vendor's appliances would add significant costs and complexity to the existing infrastructure and be disruptive to productivity during the transition process. Specifically:<br />- Firewall policies, once defined by NIST staff and authorized by NIST management, are translated from descriptive text into CheckPoint firewall objects, services, and rules prior to being deployed to the corresponding firewall(s). To date, the firewall team has over 1,900 policies deployed across all firewalls. These firewall policies are defined and deployed using integrated firewall policy managers. NIST has two policy managers which are synchronized and, due to their critical nature, are located at both NIST sites and an additional backup manager. The procurement of another vendor's firewall appliances would result in a major firewall conversion process for the appliances being replaced, a complex and extensive redeployment of the corresponding firewall policies, ongoing complexity with NIST having to maintain multiple independent firewall policy managers (disrupting the integrate policy management environment in place today), a requirement for multiple policy managers located at each site, and a more complex and costly environment to maintain in the future.
<p>NIST also has nearly 1,000 users of the CheckPoint remote access application known as SecureClient which is integrated with the CheckPoint firewalls. These users have installed the SecureClient software on their remote computers and use it to access NIST when off-site. Any other firewall vendor's product would have a different remote access application that would need to be configured, tested, and provided to these users who would then need to uninstall SecureClient and install the replacement product. This change could not be done gradually due to the need for the hardware change.</p>
<p>NIST has several site-to-site Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with other government agencies based on CheckPoint firewalls at both the NIST and other agency end of the VPN. The impact of replacing some of the NIST firewall appliances with another vendor's firewall appliances on these established VPNs is unknown.</p>
<p>NIST staff is trained and certified on CheckPoint firewalls and has extensive experience with its deployment, operation, and maintenance. Having consistent firewall hardware and software is essential to the efficient and effective management of the NIST Network Security Service. In addition, having like hardware and software enhances NIST's ability to provide Continuation of Operations (COOP) and Disaster Recovery in a consistent and cost-effective manner across both campuses.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This item is particular to one manufacturer, CheckPoint. The specifications of CheckPoint's products are essential to the Government's requirements, and recent market research indicates that other companies with&nbsp;similar products do not meet the agency's needs. CheckPoint products, maintenance, and support are available through CheckPoint authorized resellers only. According to the CheckPoint website, there are 686 resellers in the United States.<br />All authorized, responsible resellers of CheckPoint products are encouraged to provide a quotation for the requested items, and all quotes received from CheckPoint authorized, responsible resellers will be considered.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include-</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Terms of any expressed warranty; <br />(4) FOB Destination-based firm-fixed-price for each item in the attached Microsoft Excel document and discount terms; <br />(5) Evidence that the Offeror is authorized by CheckPoint to sell CheckPoint products; and <br />(6) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. <br />(c)Period of acceptance of Offers. The offeror agrees to hold the price in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the dates specified for receipt of offers. All quotes shall be received not later than 3:00 PM Eastern Time on August 10, 2009 at keith.bubar@nist.gov. Faxed quotes will not be accepted.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a purchase order to the responsible, and CheckPoint authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation represents the lowest price to the Government. Only quotations that fully address and meet the technical requirements of all required contract line items in the attached Microsoft Excel document will be considered for award.</p>
<p>The following clauses will be included in the resultant purchase order: <br />52.212-4 <br />52.212-5 Alternate II, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1) and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.203-15 (see full text above), 52.204-11 (see full text above), 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, and 52.232-33.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential quoter.

Question:  
1.       Accuracy:
(Specification) 2.1.3  (states) Accuracy per 50 mm not to exceed 10 m
We assume this means accuracy no less than 10um? Correct? Same questions for all other stages.

Answer:
Accuracy values greater than 10 micrometers are not acceptable.  For instance, stated accuracy per 50 mm of +/- 15 um would not be acceptable.  However, accuracy per 50 mm of +/- 5 um would be acceptable.  This statement is true for all stages listed in the document.

Question:
2.       Controller
We assume controllers are supplied by you? Correct?

Answer:
 The controller will be supplied by NIST through National Instruments.

Question:
3.       Is there any maximum size requirement for these stages?

Answer:
There is no maximum size requirement for the stage.

All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including closing date and time, remain unchanged and in full effect.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items under simplified acquisiiton requirements and prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.602, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a total small business set-aside.

This solicitation number is HHSN1108672KH and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35. Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland and Baltimore, Maryland (see Various Place of Performance). 

The National Institute of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), has a requirement for a Teaching Genetic Counseling Supervisor. 

Genetic Counseling Supervision is taught as an interactive process intended to monitor the quality of client care, improve clinical skills, and facilitate professional and personal growth of the genetic counseling students. The contractor will provide professional supervision to students enrolled in the Genetic Counseling Graduate Program. The sessions will address the students counseling learning objectives and how well their clinical casework is meeting those objectives.  The students will be graded on a pass/fail basis that is outlined for them in a supervision consent document. This work will be completed May 31, 2010.  

Contractor Requirements

Professional supervision involves meeting with seven students weekly for one hour throughout the academic year. A typical supervision session will include an oral case presentation by the student supported by audiotape segments of casework highlighting issues related to learning contract goals.  The contractor will also review brief written case notes.  Students have the opportunity to ask questions, explore alternative interventions, discuss/discover counter-transference themes, address ethical concerns, and receive feedback and suggestions on their therapeutic interventions. 
Formal evaluations of the students clinical casework will be conducted at the end of each term.  Evaluation criteria will be based on self-assessment through oral and written case reports, discussion of at least three audiotaped segments of counseling sessions (or role plays) each quarter, exploration of two partial case transcripts each quarter, and the degree to which the student accomplishes the goals set forth in the learning contract.  Students can expect potential benefits of supervision to include improvement of their counseling conceptualization and intervention skills and an increased sense of professional identity. In addition to a grade (P/F) students will receive a complete supervision summary at the end of the year that outlines their work and accomplishments. The course is taught over four 8-week (for a total of 32 weeks) terms extending over the academic year from 8/21/09-5/31/10.

Additionally, the contractor will teach a concurrent Self-Awareness course as part of the supervision requirements of the Genetic Counseling Program. The course will consist of 4 sessions to take place in the first term, between 08/21/09 to 10/21/09. 

Government Responsibilities

NHGRI will supply the meeting rooms for supervision to occur either on the JHU campus or the NIH campus of the program.  The Program Director will review student progress with the instructor on a quarterly basis or more frequently if students are encountering difficulties.  The Program Director will submit the grades from the contractor-taught course. 

Period of Performance: 

August 21, 2009 to May 31, 2010.

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables

Supervision reports will be verbally summarized for The Program Director at the end of each term.  The contractor will keep supervision notes throughout the academic year to be used to compile the written summary at the end of the academic year.  A pass or fail grade will be given to the Director by e-mail correspondence at the end of each term.
 
Program Management and Control Requirements: N/A

Inspection and Acceptance Requirements

Since services will be delivered on the JHU School of Public Health campus or the NIH campus used by the Genetic Counseling Program, inspection of the site and circumstances will take place at one of these locations.  The site will be inspected for a comfortable setting for the student to present her casework and sufficient room for the contractor to be able to take notes and listen to audiotapes in a confidential manner.  The Program Director will inspect the setting and accept the site according to this criteria. The format for the written supervision summary will be shared with the contractor and will be required as a final document completing the four term course series.  Verbal summaries at the end of each quarter on individual student progress will be required.  

Cost Basis
32 weeks of hourly supervision for 5 students 
16 weeks of hourly supervision for 2 students (to graduate in January 2010) 
4-session series (2 hours each) of Self-Awareness Training 

Past Performance Criteria:

A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  USAID assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  USAID uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate USAID retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  

INTRODUCTION

In August 2002, USAID began implementation of a program in Venezuela to provide assistance to maintain democratic stability and strengthen the countrys fragile democratic institutions.  The USAID Venezuela program operates out of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and is part of a larger U.S. government effort to promote democratic stability in Venezuela. The program includes a flexible, small grants program which supports activities that promote peaceful resolution of the current political crisis through facilitating dialogue, public debate on key issues, support to democratic institutions, and the promotion of citizen participation and democratic leadership.  The program also supports Venezuelan civil society organizations that work on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, health care and legislative and judicial system monitoring.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that USAID has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent USAID and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the Regional Team Leader, and is based in Caracas as the senior USAID representative in the country.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.      

The Country Representatives principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAIDs Venezuela country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent USAIDs mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.  

Duties and Responsibilities

The work of the USAID Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based USAID Regional Team Leader for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), the Country Representative will:

	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;

	Serve as USAIDs primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.

	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;

	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of in-country USAID staff;

	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief USAID and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;

	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to USAIDs implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to USAIDs program objectives and are within the partners scope;

	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partners scope to USAIDs country objectives, partners budgets, and modifications thereto;

	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAIDs Automated Directives System);

	Ensure that USAIDs programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as The Berry Amendment) impose restrictions on the DoDs acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and specialty metals (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.

New DOD requirements for wood packaging material (WPM) have been developed in response to international implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization protocol on International Standards for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) 15. ISPM 15 is designed to block movement of pests that can destroy forests from one nation to another. DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo. (For more information, see the American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated Web page at http://www.alsc.org.) The new WPM requirements will be reflected in DLA solicitations and awards issued on or after August 1, 2006. WPM is defined in the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material. (Note that DOD does not endorse the Methyl Bromide Fumigation Program. Only heat treatment or kiln dried heat treatment of WPM are authorized.) After August 1, 2006, contractors can be held accountable for taking corrective action on noncompliant shipments.

DSCP has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DSCP Clothing and Textiles (DSCP C&T) solicitations, use the following link to the DSCP C&T Technical Data Repository area at

<DESC>The US Forest Service, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, is seeking Fuels Treatment Serivces as follow:


All Units scheduled for treatment on this Project are Hand Treatment Units.
There are 537.8 acres on this project scheduled to be treated by chipping-on-site or chipping to specification.  The cutting to specifications of 34.7 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. Trees will be pruned to specification, cut to ground spacing specification, and chipped on-site or chipped to specification. Shrubs will be cut to specification, and specified spacing specifications. Shrubs not listed in H 8 will require cutting to specification. All cut material will be chipped-on-site or chipped to specification.  Within the 34.7 acres, there are structures, fences, small buildings, conduits, communications wire and cables in units which will require that the Recommended defensible zone space distances specification be followed. The Forest Service will flag in orange or red or other bright colors, before the contract begins conduits, cables and other items requiring attention by the contractor. During contract implementation, more items requiring special treatment may be found. Contractor will protect flagged items and cutting and chipping operations will be done in a manner that will not damage any of the found or flagged items. A contract administrator will be on-site during the cutting and chipping operations when working in the areas of these flagged items. No hand piling of cut materials is anticipated but should hand piling be required for short or long duration, piles will be placed a minimum of 50 feet from flagged items. There is no separate pay item for these areas. Contractor is expected to work with the Forest Service and permitted users in the area. For discussion, these flagged areas are called polygons. Polygons can be closed, open or linear for items such as the aluminum conduit. These polygons flagged in orange, red, or other bright colors, will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. All polygons are to be done by Hand Treatment. Hand treatment for a polygon is, hand cut and hand carry all cut materials, to outside the flagged polygon. Contractor will not pile any materials in designated polygons.  The remaining 503.10 acres have previously been cut to specification and the cut materials piled in preparation for chipping-in-place or chipping to specification. In some of these acres the weather has caused some of the cut material to be blown out of the piles. In other acres, wood gatherers have removed the firewood and left the piles in disarray. Some materials scheduled for chipping will require gathering prior to chipping in this acreage.  A Processing and Storage area will be designated for the contractors use throughout the contract if requested.
Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
Wood, or chips which have been stacked or piled in Processing and Storage Areas, by the contractor is the property of the contractor until Final Acceptance of Unit or Project. Prior to Final Acceptance, wood chips must be removed from Government Property by the contactor, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
The Schedule of Items contains a Base Bid, an Option 1, and an Option 2. 
The Units in the Base Bid are Categorized as being easy, to moderately difficult to treat and complete the prescription of Cutting to Specification and Chipping to Specification, or just Chipping to Specification.
The Units in the Option 1, are Categorized as being More to Very Difficult to treat and to successfully complete Chipping to Specification. It is determined that units in Option 1 may require the Contractor be required to use innovative methodology and may need to use equipment other than a pull behind or remote controlled Chipper. Option 1 units may require additional skilled personnel or require that the contractor utilize more personnel. Option 1 units are located on steeper slopes, or are possibly less accessible, or are located such that the contractor must be more knowledgeable in techniques to chip to specification such acreage.
The Units in Option 2 are Categorized as being more than Very Difficult to treat to specification. It is determined that units in Option 2 may not be treatable by conventional methodology. Units in Option 2 may require the contractor to use machinery appropriate to accessing these remote units, or using techniques that require innovative methodology.
The Forest Service expects to award the Base Bid and Option 1 if Unit Prices are less than the cost of doing similar work by using Forest Service Fire Personnel to burn piles during the appropriate season. The Forest Service expects to award the Option 2 portion of the contract if the cost of doing similar work is the same or only somewhat more than the cost of using Forest Service Fire Personnel to burn the piles during the appropriate season. The Forest Service is aware that Option 2 acreage may not be feasible to treat by Chipping-in-Place or Chipped to Specification.
All acreage in all units will be paid for at Actual Quantities. Only acreage completed by Chipping to Specification will be paid for at Bid Price. Acreage which cannot be Chipped to Specification will be measured and quantities reduced for each unit. No reduction or increase in Unit Price will be negotiated for acreage Chipped or not Chipped.
Contractor is expected to review all acreage and units prior to submitting the Request For Proposal as the Forest Service expects the units and acreage to be treated to specification unless otherwise stated in the Request for Proposal.
Units or portions of the project are at elevations which are subject to early or late winters. Other locations are at lower elevations and are not subject to lengthy weather delays. This 120 day contract is for a continuous period of time and only very unusual weather will be permitted to delay the completion date. Some units are at higher elevations and get snows which do not melt until late in the Spring. Other locations on the project get snow which melts in a shorter length of time. Contractor is expected to schedule work on the project such that all work is completed within the 120 days scheduled. Contractor is expected to submit a proposed work schedule with the submitted Request For Proposal which will be used in the evaluation and will indicate how contractor will complete the project before the end of Calendar year 2009.

Under the Commerical Items authorities, the CO has opted for a slightly abbreviated time for response tot he solicitation due to time constraints and the necessary start time of the contract.  Offers are due no later than August 28, 2009 at 1700.  There will be an amendment issued during the prior week clarifying and answering all questions which arise as a result of the solicitation pre-bid conference, site viewing which will be conducted on August 7, 2009.  Interested vendors should meet at Mahogany Grove Campground.  (See solicitation for map of area, and directions).  There is also a clause in the solicitation with details.  The Lee and Kyle canyon sites will be guided, then contractors will be invited to visit the Cold Creek and West side sites on their own, after a Q & A session.

The technical point of contact is either Chad Courtright at 559-781-3396 or ccourtright@fs.fed.us OR Bob Emley at 559-280-0105 or remley@fs.fed.us

<DESC>This is  modification 2 to the synopsis entitled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SUPPORTINGTHE MAKER PROJECT under NNJ09298123Q which was posted on July 20, 2009. The intent ofthis modification is to answer all technical questions submitted. They are as follows:Question #1: Should we determine the associated rotational inertias of each of the limbsand understand the associated loads of the manipulator so that we can apply a feedback(feed forward) based control? Answer #1: The weight and corresponding momentum of the toolheads placed on themanipulator will undoubtedly effect the accuracy of the manipulator at highfeedrates/translation speeds.  That being said, there is no minimum federate/translationspeed requirement for the assembled device.  The vendor can choose to solve the problemby deploying advanced  motion control compensation methods (if a high federate is to besought) or by simply establishing what the vendor recommended upper federate limit isbased on the method of control algorithm that is created.  Question #2: Or is the scope of this project strictly related to controlling the robotarm based on the kinematics (i.e. x,y,z position &lt;-&gt; angular positions of therobotic arm) of the system?  Answer #2: Refer to Answer #1. Question #3: If the robot uses stepper motors, is it safe to assume that position control(not force-based) is being used to control the robotic manipulator?  Does that mean noforce feedback will be used?  Answer #3: No, force feedback is not to be used in this effort.  The position is to becontrolled by closed loop encoders communicating data about the step/direction/rate ofthe steppers.  The only feedback component of the schema will be whatever amperage/powerlimits the motor drivers inherently use to protect the steppers from being overdriven.	Question #4: Are LabVIEW  or  C++ acceptable languages to use for the underlying programand/or GUI?   Is there a preference toward LabVIEW  (which is fine by us as a NI AllianceMember)?Answer #4: There is no preference, although the end product must provide a graphical userinterface and either be compilable to a stand-alone executable or run on a commonlyavailable software platform.  Whatever method is used, the sourcecode must be deliveredalong with the final executable and specific communication regarding what softwareplatform must be used use the software and/or modify/recompile it.  Question #5: How much access will we have to the robotic manipulator itself to doevaluation/modeling/testing?  Answer #5: The manipulator is housed in a development lab at NASA JSC in Houston Texas. Access to this facility can be established for US citizens on an as-needed basis forinspection of the manipulator, beta testing of the software, or supporting finalintegration of the software and electronics/computer.  If the vendor believes such travelwill be necessary during the development cycle, the quote for such travel (along withnecessary travel during the final integration at JSC) should be included in the responseto this effort. If the vendor requires full-time access to the manipulator during thedevelopment phase, the device can be shipped to the vendors facility via NASA/JSCProperty Office policies and procedures.Question #6: With the system any 3 axis coordinates do not uniquely specify a point inspace--there is more than one way to specify most points.  This may make it challengingto find the "best" coordinates for any given translation, and the "best" method oftranslating the arms to achieve a certain path.  Upon initial review it does not appearthat request mentions a desire for an optimal path, is there? Answer #6: The only point on the device that must follow a given path is the X,Y,Z centerof the manipulators hand relative to the baseplate.	This path is the toolpathdefined by conventional CNC g-codes established either by manual programming or automatedcode generation via CAD/CAM.  It is understood that multiple shoulder/elbow jointrotation combinations could be developed to bring the center of the hand to a givenpoint in three-space.  However, when following a coordinated path through three-space thesoftware must plan ahead such that in following a path the joint orientation/rotationchoices that are made do not result in a kinematic singularity that will fault themanipulator or controlling software.

In addition to the Regional Mission in Almaty, Country Offices are located in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and work in close collaboration with the Regional Mission to carry out USAID development priorities.  Within the Regional Mission, the Office of Health and Education (HE) has primary responsibility for the management of assistance in the health and education sectors.  

USAID/CARs objective in health care is to assist the public health systems in the Central Asian Republics to better meet the health needs of vulnerable groups.  Activities are focused on four areas:  1) Contributing to safer medical environments; 2) Strengthening public health capacity; 
3) Improving the quality of health services; and 4) Empowering civil society to better respond to health needs.  

B)  Basic Functions of the Position:

The position is located in the Uzbekistan Country Office (UCO) of the USAID/CAR regional mission.  The incumbent is a member of the USAID/CAR/UCO team and USAID/CAR Health and Education Office team.  The incumbent works under the direct supervision of the USAID/CAR/UCO Country Representative or his/her designee.  The incumbent receives supervisory support and technical guidance from the USAID/CAR Health & Education Office Director based in Almaty.  

The incumbent serves as the senior public health advisor on Uzbekistan to the USAID Uzbekistan Country Office Director, USAID Central Asian Republics (CAR) headquarter-based staff, and Embassy Tashkent.  Job holder shares responsibilities with USAID/CAR regional mission for the development and implementation of public health-related program activities and has direct responsibility for day-to-day coordination and monitoring of all USAID health development activities in Uzbekistan, including activities that implement or support the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  

The employee is responsible for overseeing USAID/CAR initiatives in the health sector in Uzbekistan, as assigned. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of health issues in the region, a background in public health programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with government officials, international donors, USAID implementing partners and local non-governmental partners.  Incumbent works closely with the Health & Education Office at USAID/CAR regional headquarters office in Kazakhstan to ensure that USAID-funded health development activities carried out in Uzbekistan contribute to measurable results that are in accordance with agency regulations, assistance objectives, international ethical guidelines, and public healthcare standards and best practices.

C)  Major Duties and Responsibilities:

The Public Health Management Specialists responsibilities and duties shall include, but are not limited to the following:

1) Job holder is the principal public health technical analyst and advisor to the UCO director and USAID/CAR on health-related programming in Uzbekistan.  This includes development of new programs and initiatives that are in accord with the goals, objectives, and policies of Congressional earmarks, directives and Presidential initiatives (e.g., PEPFAR).  Incumbent plays a lead role in strategic planning, project development and drafting of UCO input into the health program area of the Operational Plan (OP) for Uzbekistan.  

To carry out these responsibilities, job holder must stay abreast of changes in the host country public health infrastructure, advising agency management on observed strengths, weaknesses and opportunities.

<DESC><p>This is an award synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.3. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Predator Systems Group, awarded Order 0051 to the existing Basic Ordering Agreement FA8620-05-G-3028, on a sole source basis to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. (GA-ASI) for final design to integration and testing of ASIP on the Predator and integration design on the Reaper Unmanned Aerial Systems. The initial effort, Phase I, Order 0028, was for the analysis, system requirements definition, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), and preliminary integration design to integrate the Airborne Signal Intelligence Payload (ASIP) program sensor on MQ-1 and MQ-9 aircraft. The Government does not own the data rights for the system; therefore, to avoid duplication of costs, the Government awarded the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracting arrangement was awarded IAW FAR 16.306(b)(1)(ii) - for development and test to which a CPIF is not practical, nor was a Firm Fixed-Price arrangement due to risk.</p>

<AWARDEE>UT-Battelle, LLC, P.O. Box 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 US
<DESC><p>Recovery Action: The Recovery Action project entitled "Nuclear Physics - Advanced Utilization of Isotope Facilities (2005230)" will enable UT-Battelle, the Management and Operating Contractor for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), to perform the Remote Target Fabrication refurbishment and the PaR Remote Handling System replacement which will enhance isotope production and processing capabilities at ORNL to enable the program to better meet the need for isotopes in short supply. Additionally, this action will enable UT-Battelle to replenish the stable isotope inventory to continue to supply research isotopes. The DUNS number is 0991142870000.
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award: As the Management and Operating (M&amp;O) contractor, UT-Battelle is responsible for all activities at ORNL and the facilities located at the site. The Statement of Work (SOW) for the ORNL M&amp;O contract primarily addresses the conduct of basic and applied research and development (R&amp;D) to advance scientific knowledge, the nation's energy resources, national security and environmental quality and to strengthen educational foundations and national economic competitiveness. However, also included in the SOW are requirements for many other non-R&amp;D types of work consistent with the Department of Energy's mission. The work referenced in this synopsis has been reviewed by the Contracting Officer and determined to be within existing scope. UT-Battelle anticipates numerous subcontracting opportunities for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funded projects and plans to conduct competitive, fixed-price procurements for much of the work. Many of the subcontracting opportunities will be directed at small businesses. Points of contact for specific projects involving subcontracting opportunities at ORNL are reflected at the following web site: http://www.ornl.gov/adm/contracts/majorprocs.pdf</p>

<p><strong>THIS AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.</strong></p>
<p>A GSA MOBIS Schedule 874 Task Order has been awarded for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) using RECOVERY ACT funds.</p>
<p>The order is for one Base period of 13 months with four 12 month option years. Base Period funded amount: $30,687,274.09. Base Period Total Value: $37,804,922.41. Base and all Option Value: $98,779,939.51</p>
<p>Awardee: Booz Allen Hamilton - GSA MOBIS SCHEDULE # GS-23F-9755H (Primary Contract Vehicle) &amp; IT SCHEDULE # GS-35F-0306J</p>
<p>The Department of Interior National Business Center's Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Department of Commerce is awarding a task order to obtain Contractor provided services for support of an end-to-end solution for the implementation and execution of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The contractual action (Task Order award) will provide support for the following program areas: Program Administration, Application Review Process, Communications and Outreach, Grants Administration and Post-Award, Technical Assistance, and Management Support. This requirement will be funded with Recovery Act funds. The services are considered to be primarily of a severable nature. Services procured as a result of this acquisition will be non-personal services, and the duties outsourced are not inherently governmental functions. The objective of this award action is to develop, administer, and integrate a program to ensure timely and efficient distribution of funding to qualified applicants. BTOP is a competitive grant program that will enable consumers and businesses in unserved and underserved areas of the United States to access broadband services. BTOP will stimulate demand and facilitate greater use of broadband services while contributing to economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p><br />Use of Firm-Fixed Price Methods and Justification for Time and Materials</p>
<p>This task order was not awarded primarily as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit all prices to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to justify a full fixed price approach.</p>
<p>The task order award for this acquisition will be a primarily a time and materials (T&amp;M) award. There are seven labor hour CLINS and three firm-fixed priced CLINS and line items for travel and other direct costs. It is anticipated the tasks being performed on the Government site will be priced on a fixed-priced basis. This T&amp;M hybrid approach is being used as no other type of contract is suitable for procuring the off site services for this requirement. It is not possible to accurately predict the number of applications that will be submitted to the BTOP office. The level of effort required to process and administer the applications will vary considerably depending on the number of applications received. As it is not certain as to the number of applicants, it was determined to be in the best interests of the Government to utilize a more flexible contact type to match the required work being performed. The requirement was structured to maximize the use of fixed-price activities within the labor hour contract structure. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency policy, a formal Determination and Finding Document has been prepared and approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity.</p>
<p><br />AQD is an ISO 9001 certified federal organization with a well-trained acquisition staff, offering Federal managers solutions by managing complex acquisition processes. We have a highly trained and educated team of acquisition professionals ready to help clients manage the complexities of federal acquisition, while employing best practices to achieve client goals at every step in the process.</p>

<DESC>Understanding the human terrain is a challenging and necessary component of mission success for military personnel who are deployed overseas.  To be effective, understanding must be coupled with cultural proficiency: the ability to translate knowledge of target culture into culturally appropriate behavior in real-time interpersonal interaction.  The need for cultural proficiency training and practice is a crucial one that affects nearly every sector of the armed forces. Viable solutions must be attuned to the abilities of the learner and the demands of a richly detailed learning objective.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work: 1) Upgrade campsites to 50 amp service at Bluff Creek (88), Cotton Hill (104), Hardridge (77), White Oak (94); 2) Plan, layout and construct replacement gate attendant station at Bluff Creek, Cotton Hill, Hardridge, and White Oak campgrounds; 3) Renovate Fish Cleaning Station at Cotton Hill; 4) Install new Fish Cleaning Station including drain field and septic tank at Hardridge; 5) Plan, layout and construct in-park water service connections for Cotton Hill, 6) Plan, layout and construct in-park sewer service connections for 104 campsites in Cotton Hill; 7) Purchase and install pre-fabricated group picnic shelter for White Oak, 8) Purchase and install prefab bridge to access new picnic shelter, 9) Purchase and install prefab group picnic shelter at White Oak, shelter was destroyed during storm. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each area.  2)  The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 17 recreation areas, three operations areas, and the Project Management Office.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore: 1) The contractor prepared the specifications and drawings for the new roof in 2008 but actual replacement of the roof was delayed due to lack of funds.  2)  Acquisition strategy meetings held prior to ARRA funding determined existing contractor would be responsible for installing the new roof.  3)  The contractor has experience from replacing roofs at Jim Woodruff Powerhouse and George G. Andrews Powerhouse.  4) The contractor has experience with working around power generation schedules due to the operation of rotating equipment.   5)  The contractor has experience with working around the existing contractor whos performing on-site rehabilitation of generator units 2 and 3.   6) The contractor has experience in working around high voltage equipment, arc flash hazard, and suspended platforms. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen circumstance encountered during the job.

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN <br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br /><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY<br /><br />448 SCMG/PKBB<br />Supply Chain Management Group/Contracting Division<br />3001 Staff Dr, STE 2AC1/109B<br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3032<br />FD2030-09-07263<br /><br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br /><br />This Justification and Approval (J &amp; A) authorizes use of other than full and open competition procedures to obtain a remanufacture contract for the F118-GE-100 Pyrometer. This Individual Sole Source J&amp;A is for an urgent fixed quantity of 7ea. Ametek Inc, Aerospace, 59 Fordham Road, Wilmington, MA 01877 US is the only known qualified source to remanufacture the F118-GE-100 Pyrometer.<br /><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS<br /><br />INPUT/OUTPUT NSN: 6685-01-323-3452JU
<p>INPUT/OUTPUT P/N: 1344M74P03 <br /><br />NOUN: Pyrometer<br /><br />ENGINE: F118-GE-100<br /><br />AIRCRAFT: B2<br /><br />ITEM DESCRIPTION: The Pyrometer is approximately 12.85 inches, Sensor lens and tube diameter 1.25 inches, Weight 4.1 pounds.<br /><br />FUNCTION: The Pyrometer optically scans a portion of each high pressure turbine blade as blades rotate through optical viewing path of the Pyrometer.</p>
<p>QUANTITY: 7 EA</p>
<p>ESTIMATED REMANUFACTURE COST: $17,206.00</p>
<p>ESTIMATED TOTAL COST: $120,442.00</p>
<p>ACQUISITION HISTORY:</p>
<p>No prior contract on this item. Has never been remanufactured.</p>
<p><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2. Ametek Inc., Aerospace is the only known source with the capability to remanufacture the F118 Pyrometer. The approval level for this J&amp;A is the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE<br />QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION<br />REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE <br />(APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>A. OC-ALC has an urgent and immediate need for the repair of the F118-100 Pyrometer. Currently we have 0 backorders with 0 serviceable and 7ea un-serviceable assets. We have 0 MICAP, 0 YBQ, 0 RSP backorders. The quarterly demand rate = 1.0 with monthly demand rate at 0.3. Denial of this request will impact engine production, which would affect World Wide F118 Engine Stock Levels. The F118 engine line will be shut down, which will impact the availability of spare engines to forward operating locations, Dyess AFB, and Tinker's RE21 Consolidated Repair Facility (CRF) location, which will create holes in the B-2 Aircraft, thus affecting war readiness. If this contract is not processed as urgent the repair could be impacted by the OEM's plans to move their repair facility in the future which would require a recertification process of their new repair facility.</p>
<p>B. A sole source follow-on requirement contract will be initiated if needed in the future for the remanufacture of the F118-100 Pyrometer. Currently OC-ALC does not have unlimited access to the technical data required to perform comprehensive remanufacturing of this item. Data required to remanufacture component parts within the F118-100 Pyrometer is not owned by the government and cannot be purchased, developed or otherwise obtained. All data required to remanufacture the Pyrometer are proprietary to the OEM. Ametek, Inc., Aerospace, 59 Fordham Road, Wilmington, MA 01877 is the only known responsible source substantiated to remanufacture the F101-102 Pyrometer.<br /><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE<br /><br />IAW FAR 5.202 this requirement will not be synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Ametek, Inc., Aerospace, 59 Fordham Road, Wilmington, MA 01877 is the only known source that has been qualified in accordance with the established Qualification Requirements (QR) to remanufacture the F118-100 Pyrometer. The QRs were last published in FebBizOpps in 11 Aug 08. This contract effort will be limited to the quantity required. Currently, there are no Source Approval Requests in process. Copies of the requirement information will be provided to any potential source who requests it.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE<br /><br />The Contracting Officer will insure that the item contemplated for acquisition is negotiated at a fair and reasonable cost to the Government. The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) input will be used if necessary throughout the life of the contract. <br /><br />VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED<br /><br />IAW FAR 10.001(a) (2), Ametek, Inc., Aerospace, 59 Fordham Road, Wilmington, MA 01877 is the only known responsible source who can meet this requirement. All data required to remanufacture F118-100 Pyrometer is proprietary to the OEM. This remanufacturing knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. The contract will be awarded in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>IX. OTHER FACTS<br /><br />This is a fixed quantity type contract. Failure to obtain the service requested could cause unanticipated loss of thrust and control of critical engine functions leading to mission abort and/or in-flight shut down. Ametek, Inc., the OEM, is the only known source having the engineering drawings, source data, unique tooling and test equipment necessary to perform this repair.<br /><br />X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION<br /><br />A. Acquisition Data Availability: At present, Ametek, Inc., Aerospace, 59 Fordham Road, Wilmington, MA 01877 is the single authority that controls quality of the finished F118-100 Pyrometer using information they have developed as the original equipment manufacturer. The component function and design are too complex to consider reverse engineering initiatives therefore no corrective actions will be considered an option at this time.</p>
<p>B. No other potential sources have expressed an interest in the acquisition. <br /><br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED<br /><br />Information regarding this requirement, including but not limited to QRs, will be provided to any interested source IAW applicable regulations and procedures. The Contracting Officer will verify that there are no additional sources prior to the issuance of this contract.</p>
<p>Additional sources may be identified IAW AFMCFARS 5309-204-(a) (1). Sources who submit Source Approval Request (SAR) packages will be evaluated IAW Source Approval Procedures.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION<br /><br />The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.<br /><br />XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION<br /><br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>
