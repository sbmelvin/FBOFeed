<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice and draft statement of requirements is provided pursuant to FAR 5.205(c).  The Agency intends to issue a combined synopsis/solicitation under FAR 12.603 at a later date.

The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Office of Financial Management Systems (BD) is seeking a single vendor to provide a COTS solution(s) for billing and accounts receivable, managed hosting services and Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) support for such.  Offerors should team to provide a complete solution.  This shall be acquired through a full and open competition. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued in the December 2007 ? January 2008 timeframe for 30 days.  The contract will be awarded for one year with options through year ten.

This includes the functionality of Unfilled Customer Orders, Unbilled Receivables Management, Billing, Billed Receivable Management and Collections, Delinquency Management and Claims.  The proposed solution must support GSA and the agencies GSA is providing accounting services for as a Financial Management Line of Business (FMLOB).  

Background
GSA is the federal government agency whose two major services, Public Building Service (PBS) and Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), operate the following business lines: Global Supply and Services, Personal Property, Travel, Motor Vehicle and Card Services, Integrated Technology Services, Assisted Acquisition Services, and Real Property Services. The Office of Governmentwide Policy and the Office of Citizen Services and Communications also have requirement for collections.  Through these programs GSA has over 70 sources of income. GSA?s major customers are federal agencies across the Military and Civilian sectors. Annually GSA processes approximately $16,205 billion in bills and $18,654 billion in collections. 

GSA?s legacy system for AR and Billing is a 30 + year old proprietary main frame system. It is no longer feasible or cost effective to maintain this system as it cannot be easily upgraded to implement new government rules and guidelines, cannot support new technologies which could reduce/eliminate manual processes, or meet increasing security requirements.  The system includes many redundant processes and does not support GSA?s financial management enterprise architecture.  

Goals:

GSA expects to achieve the following objectives in implementing this system.
The optimal alternative will:
?	Enable elimination of time-consuming manual processes in Regions and Finance Centers;
?	Enable resolution of audit findings;
?	Improve currently weak linkages b/w acquisition, inventory control, and accounting processes;
?	Reduce the need for multiple systems and duplications in work; 
?	Provide for seamless interfacing/integration with the GSA core accounting system;
?	Streamline/standardize business processes and data;
?	Meet security requirements;
?	Enable users to ease of access to financial and business data;
?	Provide for an accelerated time-to-market implementation;
?	Strengthen financial controls by leveraging technology where possible (automated workflow; validation edits; etc.);
?	Improve data management, presentation, and access;
?	Reduce life cycle costs compared to the current baseline;
?	Comply with Federal standards and requirements;
?	Facilitate continual progress toward standardization and interoperability; and
?	Facilitate continued progress toward reduction/elimination of duplicative systems

System Functionality:

The system needs to manage, control and update and track balances of customer orders.
The system needs to perform accounts receivable processing and aging for other than Intergovernmental Payment and Collection System (IPAC) bills. 
The system shall support all federal regulations and guidelines governing receivables, cash management, billing, delinquency management and security. The system will also support the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) requirements as well as GSA specific requirements. 
 The system shall provide the following billing capabilities:
	?? Generate 5 types of billings, IPAC, Non IPAC, Interfund (Sales within GSA), 	SIBAC and Credit Card processes. 
	?? Warehouse billing documents until bill schedule
	?? Schedule and run billing by business lines
	?? Aggregate detail data for bills by business line, bill type and other criteria
	?? Each bill type for each business line must be able to sort bills on a variety of 	methods
??Assign intelligent statement number by bill type and business line	 and retain the               last bill number used for each.  
	?? Calculate bill amounts using sliding scales, surcharges, labor hours or fixed fees 	or a combination of these
	?? Calculate bills based on expenses and apply sliding scales, surcharges, labor 	hours or fixed fees or a combination of these
	?? Produce bills based on calculations made in other systems
	?? Transport bills to IPAC and post to general ledger and establish receivable for 	collection for bills generated by Service Business lines.
	?? Generate electronic bill files for transmission and print
	?? Generate income accruals at month end for bills still warehoused after the bill 	cycle and create general ledger documents
	?? Post bills to protected and Privacy Act compliant web site for customer view of only their bills
	?? Update General ledger at all stages
The system shall process collections including processing lock box files.
The system shall perform delinquency management
The system shall process claims

	
Attachments:

The requirements and business rules will be provided after the Non Disclosure Agreement has been signed and returned to GSA.  The natural language requirements are provided in file DraftRequirements.zip.  They have been prioritized into Mandatory, Critical, and Desirable.  GSA?s Draft Business Rules are also included to provide an understanding of the environment in which the requirements must be applied.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS), currently intends to procure on a sole source basis with Specialized Technical Services (STS), 2794 Indian Ripple Road, Beavercreek, OH 45440 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.? The reason justifying the lack of competition is that STS is the only company that has a low profile night vision goggle (LPNVG) that will meet the Government's requirements. Based on market research, other companies' night vision goggles do not have a low profile design, do not have a dual channel system providing the operator with depth perception, do not possess a see-through beam-combiner capability that allows for seamless use of the image intensified channel and normal vision, do not have IR LEDs with a high power and low power providing IR illumination when!   operating in environments with zero or low ambient lighting conditions, do not have a flip-down refocus len(s) providing the capability to immediately focus on close objects to facilitate viewing maps or vehicle instrumentation, and do not provide the operator the ability to independently adjust the inter-pupillary distance of each tube allowing the user to adjust the fit of the system to his unique facial features so that the full field of view may be achieved. The requirement document for the LPNVG defines this requirement and requires that the system be lightweight, compact for ease of use, and provide an abridged profile that reduces the neck strain on the user. It must be simple to operate (by a Marine with minimal dexterity), and shall incorporate a low hardware profile configuration and a see-through capability. The system is worn during periods of limited visibility/darkness in order to enhance combat effectiveness. It uses multiple mounting capabilities (i.e., hea!  d harness, fixed mount, helmet strap, etc). The LPNVG system shall be  a small, lightweight, ruggedized image intensifier (I?) system that incorporates GEN III/GEN IV image intensifier tube technology. The system is used for target detection, recognition, identification and as a navigational aid. The low hardware profile assembly shall not exceed a threshold size of 3.25 inches profile and a weight threshold of 1.75 lbs. The image intensified field-of-view is 40? in each monocular of the binocular goggle system. The system must operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet. Operating temperature range must be 0? F to 120? F and capable of withstanding saltwater immersion to 3 meters. The Government anticipates an estimated purchase of 3 units. Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mr. John Wahl at (703) 432-3577 or john.wahl@usmc.mil. The date and time of closing is Tuesday, 13 November 2007, 3:30pm EST (Eastern Standard Time). The synopsis number is M67854-08-Q-1044. This is follow-on to a fo!  rmer buy of said item. The Government intends this procurement to be a one time buy. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 333314-Optical Instrument and Lens Manufacturing.

<DESC>The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. ("AURA"), acting as the operator of the Gemini Observatory, is seeking a vendor with electronics, control systems and software expertise to complete the design, fabrication and software development for its Laser Bench Beam Stabilization (LBBS) system for the Gemini South Laser Guide Star Facility (LGSF) in Chile. The main components of the LBBS system include: two piezo-electric tip/tilt mirror platforms mounted on the Gemini South laser bench to control the direction of propagation of the laser output beam; two position sensing devices (PSDs) mounted about 8 meters away further down the laser beam path on the Gemini South telescope to measure the laser beam pointing and centering; a control system to close the loop between the PSDs and the  tip/tilt platforms; and all associated electronics and software necessary to run the system. The successful vendor will review the current state of the LBBS design, complete the electronics, software and controls design, procure missing LBBS hardware, develop the corresponding control software and assemble and test the complete LBBS system at their facility prior to delivery in Chile for integration with the Gemini South Laser Guide Star facility.  Minimum requirement for the software part of the LBBS system is to be EPICS-based and follow the standard Gemini software architecture.

A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this procurement will be issued by AURA to those vendors that submit a request to receive the RFP by 20 November 2007. Requests to receive the RFP should be sent by email to Andrew Flach, Gemini Contracts Manager, at aflach@gemini.edu, and should reference N275555 in the subject line.  In the body of the email please give the name of your organization and the contact information (name, email, street address, and telephone) for the person who will serve as your single point of contact for this procurement.  Please do not send a proposal at this time, but wait to receive the RFP which will have a variety of additional requirements and specifications.

      JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 

1.   Contracting Activity. 
The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville

2.	Description of the Action Being Approved. 
The use of other than full and open competition to procure training equipment for the Commander of Naval Reserve Forces Command (CNRFC), Training Department, Code N7A, 4400 Dauphine Street, New Orleans, LA, 70146-5100. This is a sole source requirement funded by O&M funding, being awarded to MPRI, Inc., 1201 East Abingdon Drive  #425, Alexandria, VA, 22314-1493, under GSA contract GS-02F-0209R. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services. 
Small arms familiarization training using the Laser Marksmanship Training System (LMTS), deployed at Reserve Activities throughout the United States. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.

5.	Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. 
MPRI, Inc. is the sole provider of the Laser Marksmanship Training System in use at 132 Navy Reserve Activities throughout the United States. CNRFC uses the MPRI, Inc. LMTS as an Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) program providing initial familiarization training and follow-on sustainment training as required to prepare drilling reservists for small arms qualification at live fire ranges. CNRFC currently has 132 LMTS equipment sets deployed to each Navy Reserve Activity in the U.S. Purchase of the 5-day training sessions required will augment the 132 existing LMTS deployed at Navy Reserve Activities throughout the U.S. It will provide for more effective and efficient small arms familiarization and proficiency for the drilling reservist. MPRI, INC is the only firm capable of providing marksmanship training on this system. 

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable. For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, FISC Jacksonville has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. 
The Contracting Officer will determine the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this J&A will represent the best value and lowest cost alternative.  Furthermore, the vendor will provide its GSA schedule prices, which have already been competed and determined to be fair and reasonable by the General Services Administration.  

8.	Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. 
This procurement is a one time contract. Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the type of supplies covered by this document. If other viable sources emerge, FISC Jacksonville will assess whether competition for future requirement is needed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13.1, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-08-00025 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334519 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees.  OBJECTIVES:  The required detector systems are intended to be used for general purpose low-background gamma screening counts of  samples in two separate fixed laboratories at different geographic locations somewhere within the United States or its territories.  Each laboratory will receive one detector system consisting of a detector, associated electronics, and software. Separate quotations are requested for Item 1  (detector and electronics), Item 2 (software), Item 3 Low-Background Shield, and for combinations of Items 1, 2 and 3.  Separate contracts may be awarded for Items 1, 2, and 3, if it is determined that this will provide the greatest value to the government. The specific locations where the  equipment is to be shipped and installed have not yet been determined.  EPA will therefore perform receipt inspection at the vendor's facilities when manufacture is complete.  The inspection may be performed either in conjunction with, or after, factory testing by the vendor, at the vendor's  discretion.  This inspection by EPA will include verifying the functionality and interoperability of all components being provided by the vendor, and therefore must be performed with the equipment fully assembled and prior to packaging.  The vendor will be responsible for packaging the equipment  for temporary storage and/or shipment after the equipment is accepted by EPA. If EPA has not yet determined the final locations for the equipment at the time of receipt inspection, the vendor will be required to provide temporary storage of the equipment for up to 6 months.  The vendor's monthly  demurrage fee for providing temporary storage, if any, should be quoted separately as Items 4, 5, and 6. For both equipment items, separate fixed price quotations are requested for shipment to a destination within the 48 contiguous states, Items 7, 8, and 9.  In the event that EPA chooses one or  more locations that are not within the 48 contiguous states, a separate contract or a contract modification will be negotiated for the additional shipping costs. The specifications below are believed by EPA to be necessary to meet the functional requirements for the intended application, but  alternatives will be considered provided that bidders can demonstrate how a proposed alternative will meet the functional requirements.  General Requirement applicable to Items 1, 2, and 3  1.	The equipment must be warranted to be free of defects in material and workmanship for at least one year  from the time of acceptance by EPA.  The warranty must provide for repair or replacement at no cost to the government, and shall not require the government to pay for shipping or handling costs for return of defective equipment for repair.  Any software shall be expressly warranted to be fit and  suitable for the purpose for which it is provided and that it will operate satisfactorily on the platform specified; disclaimers of warranty of fitness for purpose are unacceptable. 2.	Documentation provided with equipment shall include instruction manuals that completely describe how to set up,  configure, calibrate, maintain, and use the equipment furnished, both hardware and software. Schematic and component layout drawings shall be provided for all circuit boards.  Assembly drawings shall be provided for all mechanical assemblies.  All drawings shall identify components by part number  and be accompanied by part lists that include all components shown in the drawings.  This documentation may be provided either in printed form, or on CD-ROM in portable document format (PDF) files. 3.	On site installation and start up services shall be provided to include: a.	Travel to and from the  installation location; b.	Unpacking, assembling, and interconnecting all components; c.	Testing all components and functions as required to verify that all components are functioning properly, and correcting any deficiencies identified, and d.	Demonstrating the normal operation and user-level tests  and maintenance of the equipment, and any associated software. e.	Training of at least one analyst in the operation of the instrument.

The Government anticipates evaluating the offers based on technical, price related factors and past performance.  The Government anticipates this solicitation to result in the award of a firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract in 2008 with a base and three (3) option periods.

Any amendments issued will be posted on the same NAVAIR web page.  After the solicitation release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all amendments.  Failure to obtain any posted amendments and to respond to each of them prior to the date and time set for receipt of offers may render your offer nonresponsive.  

CONFIDENTIAL CLEARANCE:  All potential offerors must have a current Department of Defense (DoD) Confidential clearance to obtain the classified documents associated with this effort.  Companies must officially request classified documents in writing through Linda Tome at: linda.tome@navy.mil.  

RELEASE OF TECHNICAL DATA PACKAGE INFORMATION:  This program includes information that has been designated a ?Distribution D? and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for ?sensitive? or ?controlled? technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State?s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  As such, the documents contain data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and dissemination to non-U.S. persons whether in the United States or abroad requires an export license or other authorization.  Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclose of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under the U.S. Department of State website, http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

To participate in this program, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program.  Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.

<RESPDATE>112307

<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2104, Fax 301-480-1358, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Affymetrix, Inc. Affymetrix is producing gene arrays that contain 1,000,000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), the only arrays commercially available at that density.  Analysis of SNPs in the human genome is crucial to NIDA studies of drug abuse vulnerability loci.  This gets close to reasonable power for detection of most of the addiction vulnerability loci currently being studied, according to recent modeling.  The necessary addition of this approach to ongoing studies will put NIDA in the forefront of drug abuse related genetic research.

 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13.5 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. 

 

Award to any other source will result in substantial duplication of cost to the government.  In accordance with FAR6.302-1, the supplies required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, Affymetrix, Inc. and no other supplier will satisfy the agency requirements.  The highest SNP density commercially available is needed to identify drug abuse vulnerability loci and prove or disprove the idea of polygenic contributions of common allelic variants to drug abuse vulnerability.  


Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI 242247 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Joseph S. Cuccurullo, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>** NOTICE **

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 2013 (R&D 2013) CONTRACT

The following announcement is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning for the Research and Development 2013 contract.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment to issue a Request for Proposal by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer.  This Industry Day announcement does not commit the Census Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Census Bureau is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this announcement.  


BACKGROUND

The U.S. Census Bureau?s mission is to collect and disseminate timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.  Over 200 years ago, the United States Constitution laid the foundation for what is today one of the world?s largest and most comprehensive data gathering organizations.  Every month, quarter, and year, the Census Bureau plans and conducts over 100 sample surveys that update and add to information from the economic census (taken every five years) and the population census (taken every ten years). These data collections would be impossible without continuous research and development.

The Census Bureau?s core business is conducting large-scale surveys and censuses.  This includes a full range of activities required to produce data, including list development, sample selection and estimation, questionnaire design, enumeration, and data capture, processing, tabulation, analysis and dissemination.  To remain preeminent in this field, we must conduct scientific research and technological development to support our capabilities to carry out the tasks for surveys and censuses.  We must research methodological and statistical advances that may reduce cost and resources and improve quality.  We must stay abreast of the latest technological advances through assessment and conduct research on the use of such technology to take advantage of its capabilities.  We must be aware of our customers' and respondents' concerns and willingness to participate.  We must evaluate programs and practices to determine if they are achieving desired results at a reasonable cost, especially in light of the current environment of cost effective government programs.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 2013 CONTRACT

The Research and Development 2013 Contracts are indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity multiple task order contracts for the purpose of obtaining contractor services in highly technical areas to support research and development activities across all Census Bureau programs.  The R&D 2013 contracts provides a pool of highly skilled contractors and services to assist the Census Bureau in conducting research on all survey and census methodology and processes to improve Census Bureau products and services.  The 5-year contracts allow Census Bureau program managers to obtain outside research services quickly and easily and from individuals and groups with advanced degrees and specialized knowledge, which are not always available in-house.  We are interested in attracting educational institutions; university supported firms; and privately owned firms that concentrate in sample survey research, methodology and applications.  

The new contract, R&D 2013 will be the fourth in the series of five-year contracts.  The first two five-year contracts, 1997 IQTOC (indefinite quantity task order contract) and R&D 2002 expended almost $9 million and $39 million, respectively.  To date, the current R&D 2007 has expended almost $68 million.  The 1997 IQTOC contracts were awarded to six (6) contractors and a total of 44 task orders were awarded over the five-year period of the contracts.  For the R&D 2002, eighteen (18) contracts were awarded and a total of 101 task orders were awarded over the five-year period of the contracts.  For the R&D 2007, twenty-five (25) contracts were awarded and, to date, we have awarded over 67 task orders.

The demand for contracting of research and development services has increased with years of government downsizing, aging workforce and attrition, loss of institutional knowledge, and a fiercely competitive job market for advanced, specialized skills.  While the Census Bureau has extensive need for staff with highly specialized capabilities, the majority of the current staff is engaged in the day-to-day activities of survey design, data collection and processing.  The Census Bureau has only a small number of employees devoted to the development and adaptation of mathematical statistical theory and emerging technology.   Given the broad scope and the large number of research topics, it is not practical for the Census Bureau to try to hire and retain staff with all the needed expertise. The Census Bureau has a history of collaborating with outside experts, fostering a strong positive relationship with the professional community.  Contracting for these services formalizes this process.   The Census Bureau will not use this contract when it has or intends to use available Government in-house resources.

As in the previous contracts, multiple awards are anticipated to select contractors to support the Census Bureau?s research and development efforts.   Services are needed in five major research and development technical areas:

1)    Assessment, Planning and Analysis;
2)    Data Analysis and Dissemination;
3)    Methodological Research;
4)    Statistical Analysis and Evaluation; and
5)    Survey Engineering.

The Assessment, Planning and Analysis technical area focuses on the assessment, planning and analysis of Census Bureau programs and the way the Census Bureau conducts business.

The Data Analysis and Dissemination technical area focuses on analyzing the collected data and dissemination practices to improve the quality and usefulness of the data.

The Methodological Research technical area focuses on the development, testing and refinement of census and survey methodologies and instruments such as questionnaire design, public cooperation and participation, and improvement of enumeration methods and procedures for surveys of individuals, households and establishments.

The Statistical Analysis and Evaluation technical area focuses on the development of statistical theory and methodologies for the design, production and evaluation of census and survey results. 

The Survey Engineering technical area focuses on the application of scientific and mathematical principles and development of advanced computer algorithms to solve practical survey problems for the design and operation of efficient and economical surveys, machines, processes, and systems.

Depending on the technical area, the contractor must demonstrate their capabilities to provide, quickly and cost effectively, highly skilled specialists, such as business managers, market analyst, human resource specialist, principal researchers, mathematical statisticians, survey methodologist, behavioral scientist, economists, program analysts, geographers, statistical programmers, computer scientist, requirements engineers, logistics experts, social scientist, subject matter specialist,
and quality control experts.   Advanced degrees and years of specialized experience are desired capabilities in each of the major technical areas.  In addition, contractors much demonstrate their capabilities to provide Junior Specialist, Post- PhDs, research assistants, technical writers, etc., to support the senior-level experts.

Past performance must demonstrate their knowledge and experience on the research topic, staffing capabilities, and that the performance was at an acceptable level, based on reports from customers.  Contractor performance will be assessed based on technical proficiency accuracy and reliability, degree of innovation and originality, completeness and timeliness of deliverables, adherence to progress reporting and government requirements, effectiveness of problem resolution, customer relations and communication, cost management and control, and quality of final deliverables as described in task proposals.

The qualifications of staff will be designed to identify the minimum education and experience required to bring a certain degree of specialization and/or competence to the task, not to specify the approach or solution to a research task.  The skill levels we will include will be ones we have successfully used in the three previous contracts to attract firms with the amount of expertise to conduct our research.  On a case-by-case basis, if a contractor or the government decides different skill categories or expertise are deemed necessary to solve the problem, the skill labor categories may be added to a task.

WEBSITE

The official website for the R&D 2013 contract has been created and can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/rd2013.  Industry representatives are encouraged to register on the Web site to receive updated information.  This Web site also serves as the central point for interested parties to access information and to track the acquisition process for the R&D 2013 contract.   This site will be updated regularly.  

Should the Census Bureau decide to solicit proposals for this project, a draft RFP would be posted for comment on this website.  Due to the early stages of this process, no bidder list is currently being created nor maintained.

INDUSTRY DAY ? December 17, 2007

The U.S. Census Bureau is currently in the Market Research / Industry Engagement stage for developing requirements for the R&D 2013 contract.  As part of this process, the Census Bureau invites all members of the research and development community to participate in the Research and Development 2013 Industry Day to be held at the Census Bureau Auditorium, 4600 Silver Hill Road, Suitland, Maryland on Monday, December 17, 2007 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.  This event will give interested vendors a glimpse of the contract?s possible objectives.

The Census Bureau is holding this Industry Day to kick-off the acquisition process and market research with clear and open communication with the industry.  The Census Bureau is seeking input from firms that concentrate in sample survey research, methodology and applications to obtain an understanding of current best practices in the industry regarding usage, strategies, tactics, audience segmentation, acquisition process, evaluation, and contract administration, among others, in order to develop our acquisition strategy and plans. 

EVENT REGISTRATION

To register for this event, please access the Registration Form  found on the R&D 2013 website.  The last day for registration is Monday, December 3, 2007, at 4:00 PM EST.

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MARKET SURVEY

TRANSPORTATION OF CARGO TO/FROM NORTHERN EUROPE TO/FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting a market survey on industry capabilities and potential sources for intertheater surface transportation of military cargo to/from Northern Europe to/from various destinations in Afghanistan via Central Asia.  There is no solicitation package at this time.  This market research is to solicit ideas and opinions from experts in the field pertaining to the potential follow-on competition and to develop the solicitation while determining the level of interested sources.   The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government will not make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties will be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and will be used to develop the requirement.

USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources that can provide reliable and secure time definite delivery, security, in-transit visibility (ITV) and end-to-end management of containerized and break-bulk military cargo from/to Northern Europe to/from various locations in Afghanistan, with the majority of cargo deliveries to Bagram and Kandahar airfields.  The military cargo may consist of CLASS I (food and water), CLASS II (general supplies), CLASS III (oils/lubricants), CLASS IV (construction materials), CLASS VI (AAFES supplies), CLASS VII (major end items), CLASS VIII (medical supplies), CLASS IX (repair parts), or CLASS X (non-military goods such as humanitarian supplies).  The current operating environment presents significant risk.  This includes strikes, border delays, accidents, and pilferage.  Within Afghanistan this also includes attacks and armed hijackings.  Shipments from/to the origin to/from the various destinations in the region could eventually amount to approximately 4,800 twenty foot equivalent units (TEU) and 4,150 forty foot equivalent units (FEU) per year.  Approximately 85% are dry containers and 15% are refrigerated (reefers).  Additionally, break-bulk cargo could eventually reach approximately 20,000 STONs.  

USTRANSCOM encourages all interested companies to submit a detailed response that specifically outlines your company?s ability to meet these requirements:  
     
1.	Accept cargo at origin in Europe on behalf of the Government and deliver to the final destination in Afghanistan.  The Government requires transit times of between 30 to 45 days from acceptance at the origin to the various locations within Afghanistan. 
2.	Retrograde material back to Europe on return trip.  The Government requires transit times of between 30 and 45 days for retrograde cargo from various points in Afghanistan to Europe. 
3.	Establish and operate up to six container transload points in Afghanistan.
4.	Ensure cargo loss rate is less than 1% (to include losses due to pilferage, accident, spoilage, and attacks).
5.	Provide real-time ITV compatible with command and control applications on cargo location and provide full access to the shipper and other Government employees designated by the contracting officer.  
6.	Deliver cargo by the required delivery date (RDD) on a minimum of 90% of shipments.
7.	Provide direct delivery to forward operating bases, if required.
8.	Initiate process improvements and other value added services.  
9.	Provide end-to-end management with customized information management reports related to delivery time, delivery reliability, shipment volume and other criteria that characterize and provide performance-based views.  
10.	Handle substantial increases in shipments (surge requirements) as needed for wartime and other contingencies.  
11.	Provide security for cargo from origin to destination.

Market Survey:
USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment on this requirement to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (to include potential prime contractors, subcontractors, or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following:  

1.	Is your company capable of performing the services described and would you be interested in submitting a proposal for the services identified above?
2.	If not, why?  If so, briefly describe your capabilities.
3.	What are the recommended commercial practices from a contract perspective for these types of services?
4.	What are the methods/metrics the commercial industry uses for monitoring performance?
5.	What flexibility in a performance work statement must the respondent have in order to propose the most effective and economical transportation operation? 
6.	What data from the US Government would be required for a responsible response to develop a proposal to manage and operate inbound and outbound transportation requirements?
7.	Describe the risks associated with this effort.  How can the risks be mitigated?
8.	How the company would provide ITV, security, and process claims for lost, damaged or stolen freight.
9.	Description of company?s teaming and relationship management with sub-contractors along with your company?s understanding of the challenges and risks of operating successfully in the region.  
10.	Specific identification of any limits to company?s capabilities.  
11.	Your company?s experience in providing the services described above and its experience with an operation similar in size and scope to that described above.  Include the largest projects the company managed either as a prime or subcontractor including shipping volumes, total revenue, performance goal results, and other metrics with regards to pilferage, losses, % of RDD met, and how long the relationship lasted.  
12.	Your company?s recommended commercial pricing structure for the operation described above.  Break down pricing to normal delivery, retrograde of empties and retrograde of material out of Afghanistan separately.  What are the major cost drivers? 
13.	Recommended incentive provisions to motivate performance that will meet or exceed the goals of this effort (for example RDD, cargo loss metrics, ITV).  
14.	Are there any other concerns/comments or recommendations?


Send responses to william.henderson@ustranscom.mil and cindy.strout@ustranscom.mil no later than close of business on 30 NOV 07.  No phone or FAX responses will be accepted.  Please ensure ?USTRANSCOM CARGO MARKET SURVEY? is listed in the subject line of your responses.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMAION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10 MARKET RESEARCH.  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is issuing this RFI solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes.  The goal is for the Government to obtain contract closeout support. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this RFI.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any further RFP.

DIA estimates that there are a substantial number of contracts requiring administrative services, primarily contract closeout and archiving. This shall also include the identification of unexpended obligations, the reduction of the number of incomplete or inaccurate files, and a reduction of the contact files presently maintained at DIA. This work will be performed primarily within the Washington DC metropolitan area but may also include other DIA locations within CONUS. Because some of these contracts are classified and access to classified areas at DIA is required, contractors shall be required to have personnel with active TS/SCI clearances. A Facility clearance is also required as this work can be performed at the contractor?s location. There may be an opportunity to utilize some personnel without security clearances. 

The proposed action will be restricted to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses. The Government plans to brief this requirement in detail at a later date. All questions and other inquiries should be held until that time. Interested parties should respond by email to Darnetta Thomas at darnetta.thomas@dia.mil and Maria Kersey at maria.kersey@dia.mil no later that 13 November 2007. Please provide company name and a point of contact with email address and phone number.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - Sources Sought Notice.   

The following is a request for information (RFI) on economic analysis support for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), Office of Policy and Research (OPR). This is a market survey; it is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposals or quotes or as imposing any obligation on the part of the government.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. 

BACKGROUND: 

EBSA administers Title I and certain other provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  ERISA Section 513(a) authorizes the Secretary of Labor to undertake research  and in connection therewith to collect, compile, analyze and publish data, information, and statistics relating to employee benefit plans, including retirement, deferred compensation, and welfare plans, and [other]  plans not subject to this Act.  Pursuant to this statutory authorization, OPR manages for EBSA an applied research program of economic analysis to support national policy development on a broad array of private-sector employee benefits issues.  OPR participates in all aspects of the policy-making process with respect to these issues.  OPR serves as the Administration's primary source of legislative and economic analysis of proposed employee benefits regulations and of private-sector employee benefits issues.

EBSA requires assistance with the research activities performed in pursuit of its mission.  OPR contracts to support EBSA's internal capability to develop statistical data on employee benefit plans; to provide technical assistance with the compiling of data directly related to the analysis of employee benefits policies, legislation and regulations; to develop microsimulation models to estimate the impacts of proposed new policies and legislation; and to conduct more traditional economic or behavioral research studies with application to a broad array of employee benefits policy issues.  These economic studies may have the character of either the rapid-turn-around analysis necessary for immediate policy considerations or the more intermediate-range analysis appropriate to the conduct of econometric or behavioral studies on employee benefits policy issues which are typically published in nationally recognized research journals.  Such research should anticipate future policy needs of EBSA and the employee benefits community.

Employee benefits policy issues cover a diverse array  e.g., the extent of coverage or accessibility of employee benefits, the adequacy of benefits for workers and their families, the security of benefits, tax advantages or incentives, benefits administration (or provision) market and related matters, financial economics affecting investment of employee pension plan assets, health policy related to employee health insurance plans, retirement policy and the role of private benefits in the labor framework of social insurance for the risks of poverty, illness and old age. These topics span a mix of disciplines, including public finance, labor, health, and taxation.  Lately, financial issues such as the impact of investment advice, fees on retirement accounts, and investment in alternative vehicles have gained increasing attention.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:
The purpose of this RFI is to afford industry and academia an opportunity to provide information as to the type of research that would be relevant to OPR.  All potential sources are invited to submit a research proposal or an approach for providing support and a very brief statement that addresses the respondent's knowledge, ability and experience.  The use of information received from industry and academia to complete final solicitation documents will be at the discretion of OPR. Eligibility to participate in future acquisition does not depend on responding to this notice. The government will not critique a potential offer's information. Proprietary information is not being solicited and, if included, should be identified as such.  All materials submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the government.
 
Submissions must be no more than 5-pages, 12-point Arial font, provided in triplicate, and transmitted under a cover letter.  Multiple submissions are permitted.

The cover letter must include the following information:

1.)	Response to RFI Number DOL089RI20479 ;
2.)	Contractor Name, Address, and phone number ;
3.)	Point of Contact Person Information: E-mail address, Phone, and Fax Number.

The closing date for the receipt of response is December 7, 2007, at 12:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  

All submissions responsive to this listing must be delivered or mailed to the following address:

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

WIRE ROPE NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING EQUIPMENT FOR ARRESTING ENGINE CROSS DECK PENDANTS 

This is a Request For Information (RFI).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  

The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources that have available existing technology to accomplish Wire Rope Non-destructive testing of shipboard Arresting Gear Purchase Cable Assemblies.  

The Purchase Cable Assemblies are an essential component of Navy Aircraft Carrier Arresting Engines.   The Purchase Cable is connected to the primary arresting cable Cross Deck Pendant (CDP) in which aircraft tail-hook physically engages during arrestments.  The forces of the aircraft?s forward motion are transmitted from the CDP to the Purchase Cable which is then routed below deck and through the A/G Engine through a series of pulleys, sheaves, and moving crossheads which transmit forces to the main hydraulically based energy absorption devices thereby dissipating the aircraft?s energy.   

Inspections of the Purchase Cable are required periodically based on the number of arrestments that have taken place according to a predetermined schedule.  Therefore, inspections are conducted at any time during the 24 hour day under all potential sea state conditions.  The inspection must not cause any deleterious effects, damage to the cable, or reduction in usable cable service life.   

The Purchase Cable has a nominal diameter of 1-7/16 inches (1.531 maximum), with a wire rope construction of 6 BY 31, Right-Hand Lang Lay, Warrington Seal, Die Formed Strand, Polyester Core.  An arresting gear engine has two (2) 1150 foot long cables reeved around four sheave banks (9 sheave per bank) in the system with approximately 345 feet of cable exposed to the environment after each aircraft arrestment.     

The proposed equipment must be capable of facilitating the inspection of the ship installed cable alhttp://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/ong its entire length in the ?payed-out? condition except for those sections of cable that are below deck and inaccessible.  The installed condition of the cable also necessitates that the proposed equipment be able to inspect of cables that are coated with Fuchs Lubricate H-29 Preservative without any degradation to thte lubricant and/or the accuracy of the inspection..    

The inspection apparatus must have sufficient resolution and be capable of detecting defects in the cable in accordance with the parameters given in NAVAIR 51-5BBA-2.2.

The inspection apparatus may have additional data acquisition and data logging capabilities but this is not a mandatory requirement.

The NDT method may be UT, MRI, Eddy Current, or other proven technologies for this type of application.  

Suppliers are strongly encouraged to forward information about their products in response to this RFI.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER 26, 2007 to Ms. Letitia Baker, 732-323-1193, Letitia.Baker@navy.mil

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) is posting this sources sought notice on behalf of NOAA?s Financial Systems Division. NOAA intends to negotiate sole source with GELCO Information Network GSD, Inc (GELCO) for the purchase of GELCO Reservation Manager and GELCO Integration Manager software licenses. The acquisition of software licenses for GELCO Reservation Manager and Integration Manager is to support current travel processing requirements.  This action supports NOAA?s current travel processing within the implemented Travel Manager System.  

The following are the salient factors in making the determination that GELCO is the only responsible source for this acquisition:

1. The Government requires an application designed to work in conjunction with GELCO Travel Manager.   GELCO Integration Manager and Reservation Manager are proprietary applications developed by GELCO, which are designed to work in conjunction with GELCO Travel Manager;
2. The Government does not wish to incur the significant expense of changing its travel and expense authorization and reimbursement system in order to obtain improved integration of travel data with its financial and human resource systems.  GELCO Integration Manager and Reservation Manager will work with the existing application and there is no other known package available that can provide this capability.
3. An on-line real-time processing interface capability to both a data warehouse and current accounting systems is required; GELCO Integration Manager and Reservation Manager meet this requirement;
4. The Government requires a method of reducing ongoing support costs of integration to both a data warehouse and accounting system. GELCO Integration Manager and Reservation Manager meet this requirement.
5. GELCO Integration Manager and Reservation Manager are not available from any other source; GELCO Information Network GSD, Inc. has indicated that it has no current arrangements to allow any party to resell GELCO Integration Manager.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>HQ Scott AFB/A7KQC is in the process of determining acquisition strategy for a follow-on contract for the sustainment of 42 Civil Reserve Air Fleet Aeromedical Evacuation Shipsets (CRAF AESS).  The team is soliciting responses from interested sources to determine capabilities to perform the follow-on contract.  We would appreciate any feedback industry has to offer.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The CRAF is a group of B-767 aircraft owned and operated as commercial aircraft by large air carriers such as TWA, Delta, and USAir.  These aircraft form an integral and extremely important element in the aeromedical evacuation plans during a national emergency or conflict.  These aircraft can be activated by the Secretary of Defense any time it is deemed to be in the national interest.  When activated the aircraft are given a short period of time to be configured and delivered, and be at the full disposal of the Air Force.  While the aircraft are still owned and operated by the air carriers and crews, they are assigned to perform military missions.  The aircraft are operated under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations and the aircraft captain has the authority to determine whether or not the aircraft meets the FAA specifications at any time.  Since the aircraft will always be operated according to FAA rules and regulations, all equipment and procedures used aboard the aircraft must also be in compliance with FAA rules and regulations.  

The AESS was designed for use on the B-767 aircraft as a conversion kit which allows the aircraft to be used as an aeromedical evacuation platform during times of conflict or peacetime disasters.  The CRAF AESS consists of three major subsystems: 

     a.  The patient transport subsystem ? freestanding litter stanchions that accommodate 3 patients per stanchion (87 patients total) which are independently attached to existing aircraft seat tracks.  NOTE:  The baseline configuration for the aircraft includes accommodations for 10 medical personnel, 6 flight attendants, and up to 40 ambulatory patients (in seats).
     b.  The medical oxygen subsystem ? consists of six 75-liter oxygen dewars (450 liters total) and a heat exchanger installed on a single pallet in the forward cargo bay using existing cargo fittings for tie-down.  This subsystem provides therapeutic oxygen to support a 12-hour mission with 60% of the patients using oxygen.  The converted oxygen is routed to a management panel in the main cabin via oxygen hoses routed through existing vent openings on the left side of the aircraft.  The oxygen is then routed along the aircraft main deck at 300psi via oxygen hoses attached to the litter stanchions.  Oxygen manifolds attached to the litter stanchions reduce the pressure to 50psi for use by the patients.  Emergency oxygen will be provided by standard dixie cup masks that are on oxygen lines extended to reach the lower litter tier.
     c.  The aeromedical operations subsystem ? consists of 2 nurse workstations, a regulated 60Hz electrical power supply, and storage facilities.  Electrical power from the 400Hz aircraft power bus is converted through six 5kW 400-to-60Hz converters and routed through the right side of the aircraft.

Each shipset weighs approximately 20,000 lbs. and is stored in 21 large, individual crates in an environmentally controlled government warehouse currently located in Ft. Worth Texas.  Each shipset has a 20? W X 16? L X 16? H footprint and contains components that require periodic inspection and preventive maintenance to assure that operational readiness is maintained.  

The CRAF AESS is a FAA approved modification to a commercial aircraft; therefore, it is under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) control, currently maintained under STC number SA5039SW-D.  

The shipsets have been designated war readiness material and are critical in nature.

Contract Requirements: 

1.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the CRAF AESS in a constant state of operational readiness and will provide technical and logistical assistance in support of shipset deployments.  As FAA certified equipment, the CRAF AESS must be under the control of an entity known as a Designated Alteration Station (DAS).

2.  The successful contractor shall provide all direct material in support of storage, inventory, inspection, preventive maintenance, repairs, STC maintenance, hardware modifications, shipment, installation/de-installation, refurbishment, unpacking/repackaging of shipsets, and other tasks necessary for sustainment of the system.  All materials shall conform to FAA approved data including any inspection and certificates applicable to the materials furnished by the contractor.

3. The successful contractor shall maintain configuration control of the CRAF AESS Installation/Instruction Manual to keep it current.

4.  Activation of the shipsets is possible at any time.  The successful contractor?s installation team will be required to install shipsets into B-767 aircraft, given an arrival rate of two aircraft per 24-hour period.  A range of 1 to 40 shipsets could be activated, depending on Government need and the urgency of the situation.  Upon activation, the contractor will be responsible for transporting shipsets from the storage location (currently in Fort Worth, Texas) to the contractor's installation facility.  Contractor supplied field maintenance will be required based on Government need.
 
5.  It is anticipated that a training exercise of the CRAF AESS will be conducted once every 2-3 years.  In addition to transporting and installing a shipset from the storage location to the contractor?s installation facility, the contractor will be required to transport a Government-owned patient loading system to support the exercise.  Contractor supplied field maintenance will be required based on Government need.

6.  The successful contractor shall maintain configuration control of the STC sealed drawing package.  The CRAF AESS is a FAA approved modification to a commercial aircraft; therefore, it is under STC control, currently maintained under STC number SA5039SW-D.  The successful contractor shall also update or supplement the STC documentation as necessary and ensure the STC is not compromised through changes to the CRAF AESS or to the assigned B-767 aircraft.  The successful contractor shall follow the Systems Engineering guidance as found in ASC/EN Systems Engineering Guide, 5 April 1996 and FAA Advisory Circular AC 21-40, May 6, 1998.  

7.  The CRAF AESS is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system because the oxygen used for the patients on board the aircraft must be medically safe to use.  Therefore contractors must follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as required by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  The GMP regulation covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for the design, manufacture, packaging, storage, and installation of all devices.  The GMP regulation is codified in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 820 contains general quality assurance (QA) or quality system requirements in areas of concern to all manufactured devices.   

8.  Preventive Maintenance Inspections (PMI) will occur under a varying schedule depending on the asset and FAA rules.  For planning purposes, the PMI schedule ranges from every 6 months to once every 5 years.


CONTRACTOR CAPABILITIES NECESSARY TO PERFORM CRAF AESS SUSTAINMENT:

1.  Be licensed by the FAA as a DAS and be licensed to perform work on B-767 aircraft.  As FAA certified equipment the CRAF AESS must be under the control of a DAS.  DAS designation and FAA licensing are a major requirement of the successful contractor.  Please discuss whether or not your company is DAS qualified or if your company has the potential to become DAS qualified in order to perform AESS maintenance.  If FAA licensing will have to be acquired, how long do you anticipate the licensing process to take?  What are the anticipated costs, if any, to the Government for obtaining the required licensing?

2.  Ability to obtain a station license modification, which adds CRAF AESS sustainment and installation/de-installation.  Obtaining a station license modification may require the successful contractor to provide a B-767 for an installation demonstration for the FAA.  Discuss your capability in meeting this requirement.  

3.  STC maintenance.  See contract requirement above for maintaining the STC configuration.  Discuss the feasibility of obtaining the STC and the timeframe/cost associated with initiating this process in order to perform as the successful contractor for the follow-on CRAF contract.  

4.  Expertise in handling/operating/servicing large liquid oxygen systems.  The Liquid Oxygen Storage Subsystem (LOSS) is a major component of the CRAF AESS system and requires specific expertise to ensure it is maintained in accordance with contract requirements.  Please discuss whether or not your company has expertise in handling large LOSS systems.  Discuss your experience in adhering to GMP as required by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  See contract requirement listed above.    

5.  Facilities.  The successful contractor must be able to provide a hangar and a runway capable of accepting B-767 aircraft at any time as well as sufficient space to park up to three B-767 aircraft while two aircraft are undergoing modification.  Please discuss whether or not your company has sufficient facilities and/or capabilities for accommodating the required numbers of B-767 aircraft in order to perform CRAF maintenance/modification.  If you do not currently possess the facilities, how will you obtain facilities in order to meet contract requirements?

6.  AESS activation.  The successful contractor must have the capability (during a national emergency) to provide the facilities, equipment and personnel to transport and install shipsets at the rate of 2 aircraft every 24 hours beginning not later than 48 hours after activation notice.  If these facilities differ from those described above, provide a description of your facilities but also explain how you will accomplish this task with the proposed facilities.  Since the AESS is currently stored in a government warehouse in Ft Worth Texas it is preferable that the contractor?s facilities be within the contiguous United States.  However, the government is interested in entertaining other ideas with respect to AESS storage, location of contractor?s facilities, while still meeting all contract requirements.

<DESC>Market Survey Lightweight Small Arms Systems W15QKN-08-X-0452 1.  The Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) at the Armament Research,  Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal NJ, is currently seeking  sources for the continued maturation of developmental lightweight small arms  systems, including, but not limited to, caseless ammunition and lightweight  weapon technology.  Sources must be able to show existing Lightweight Small  Arms System (LSAS) products, capabilities, technical expertise and management  systems that have the following characteristics as a minimum: A.  Ammunition: A.1) Ammunition for this system must be a minimum of 35% lighter than the  currently available brass case ammunition (for example, developmental 5.56mm  ammunition must weigh 35% less than M855 ammunition).  Other calibers may be  presented, also with a minimum 35% weight reduction from a comparable  caliber.  A 50% weight reduction is desired. A.2) At least one of the ammunition concepts presented must be a non- nitrocellulose based caseless ammunition technology.  Additionally, an  existing facility that can support the immediate fabrication of this ammuntion  must be identified and described in detail. A.3) At least one ammunition technology presented must be matured to a  technology readiness level (TRL) of 5, which means that more than 500 rounds  of this ammunition have been tested in a weapon or a simulated weapon (test  barrel) under controlled conditions.  It is desired that all ammunition  technologies be at a TRL 5 by February 2008, including the non-nitrocellulose  based caseless ammunition. B. Weapon System: B.1) This system must have the capability to fire the lightweight ammunition  described above, and must include a light machine gun variant. The technology  must also be adaptable to other small arms systems, i.e. rifles, carbines,  medium machine guns. B.2) The Light Machine Gun variant should weigh no more than 11 pounds; the  rifle variant should weigh no more than 7 pounds. B.3) The Light Machine Gun should be demonstrated to a TRL 5, which requires  that the weapon or weapons have fired more than 2,000 rounds of live  ammunition under controlled conditions. B.4) A developmental 3-D model must exist for the entire weapon system,  including dynamic simulations of the weapon action. B.5) The weapons must be designed to be highly reliable under all operating  conditions.  If actual test data is not available to support this, please  provide a reliability analysis. B.6) A complete thermal analysis of the weapon and ammunition system must be  provided that shows any potential thermal issues, and a mitigation plan that  addresses these issues. C. Management: C.1) Interested sources must identify the team that is in place to address all  aspects of the system design and development, including weapon, ammunition,  supportability/logistics, systems engineering, and program management.  Roles  and responsibilities of this team must also be described. C.2) A risk management plan and risk assessment is required that identifies  all known risks, their associated risk levels, and mitigation plans. 2.  All responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their  capabilities and qualification data in regard to the above no later than 21  November 2007, at 1600.  Please include company name, address, telephone  number, technical point of contact, brochures/literature, not to exceed 25  pages.  Information submitted should include sufficient technical  descriptions, test data, and related material as evidence of technical  credibility, design maturity and ability to build prototype weapons and  ammunition. 3.  This is a market survey for informational and planning puposes only and  should not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the  U.S. Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the  basis of this market survey.  All information shall be submitted at no cost or  obligation to the Government.  Any and all information in hard copy form  should be mailed to David J. DeCandia, Contract Specialist, AMSML-AQ-JA, Bldg  10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>*Response date above is for interest to this particular notice, not to the solicitation.  Numbered Notes 9 and 23 will apply to the upcoming pre-solicitation notice. TACOM LCMC Rock Island is soliciting industry interest for a proposed 3-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for Armor Steel Plate, Wrought, High Hardness in accordance with MIL-A-46100 and Armor Plate, Steel, Wrought Homogenous in accorda nce with MIL-A-12560.  TACOM will issue multiple awards in response to the solicitation.  The number of awards contemplated is unknown at this time, however each requirement that materializes once the multiple award contract is in place will be competed am ong all of the awardees. The specific DFARS requirement at 252.225-7030 that the steel be rolled and melted in the United States and Canada has been waived by the Secretary of the Army for some of the programs associated with any contract resulting from a subsequent solicitation b ased upon this initial notice.  The preference for domestic specialty metals would not be applicable to the requirements that are not subject to DFARS 252.225-7030, however all terms and conditions of the Buy American Act will apply to this requirement.  I n summary, a resulting multiple award contract will ideally consist of domestic providers and other than domestic providers. We anticipate requiring prospective contractors that have never provided either type of Armored Steel to the Government to qualify their particular product prior to being eligible for an award under our proposed multiple award long term contract.  This qua lification will consist of submitting a sample of steel plate to Aberdeen Proving Ground to be ballistic tested by Army Research Lab (ARL).  All qualification testing prior to contract award should be completed at the contractors expense, and ARL would re quire funding prior to the commencement of any testing. Coordination of qualification testing can be requested at armor.acceptance@atc.army.mil The contracting officer will only consider offers under the proposed solicitation if they can demonstrate that their proposed product can meet the qualification standards set forth in the specifications listed above prior to the anticipated date of award.  Contractors may submit samples for evaluation at any time, as there does not need to be a contract or solicitation for the product. For informational purposes to interested contractors, all of the following will be required in order to receive any type of award with the Department of Defense: Registration in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov, registration in and utiliza tion of Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) for shipment and invoicing of all delivery orders https://wawf.eb.mil/ , and Inspection/Acceptance at the contractors place of shipment (source) by a DCMA Government Quality Assurance Representative (QAR). This notice is issued at this point to notify industry of an upcoming contracting possibility; however a pre-solicitation synopsis will also follow with further details on the actual solicitation requirements.  Please submit to the contract specialist an e mail to beth.m.anderson@us.army.mil indicating interest in possibly providing the Governments with these materials on future contract requirements.  Please include with your submittal your specific capabilities, your logistical supply chain (i.e. indicate  whether you are a mill, buy melted products, melt and roll, country of material origin etc.), as well as your current capacities.  Please also submit any other information that would be helpful in developing an accurate view of the industry capabilities f or these items.  Request that all submittals be received no later than 20 November 2007. The anticipated date of release of the solicitation will be stated in the pre-solicitation synopsis that will follow this notice.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

(vi) SCOPE OF WORK (SOW):  I.  PROJECT BACKGROUND:  The Rio Grande levees constrain river meandering (movement of the international boundary) and provide flood protection to many Texas cities including Brownsville, Presidio, McAllen-Mission, Harlingen, and El Paso.  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) decertification of United States International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) levees in Hidalgo and Cameron Counties, TX, in November 2006 has resulted in public and local government pressure to upgrade the levees to FEMA criteria.  Prior to this, the USIBWC had already developed a work plan to rehabilitate the levees in the Lower Rio Grande.  As a result of this work plan, some of the segments of this levee are in the process of being designed or in process of having construction contracts awarded.  The work plan was for eight years, but because of the FEMA decertification, the USIBWC plans on amending the work plan by raising some segments of the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP) levees with USIBWC personnel.  The USIBWC plans on raising levees where they are 1 foot deficient of meeting the 3 foot freeboard criteria.  Approximately 10.2 miles of USIBWC levees, within a 64.5 mile reach from Donna Pump to Brownsville in the LRGFCP within Hidalgo and Cameron Counties will be raised with USIBWC forces.

<DESC>This is modification 2 to the synopsis entitled Portable Telemetry Antenna System/4200206748 which was posted on October 15,2007 and modification 1 posted on November 1, 2007.  You are notified that the following changes are made: Questions answered about travel speed and transportable requirements including weight requirements and the allowed number of subassemblies. Contractors are required to acknowledge all modifications in your response.  The due date for responses is not extended and remains November 13, 2007 by 1:00 PM (EST).  Questions: In question No. 6 of the modified solicitation, the Government stated that an elevation travel speed of 3 degrees/second and an azimuth travel speed of 6 degrees/second would be acceptable. This positive response may be in error, as these travel rates will be insufficient to track most LEO satellites. Tracking many of the LEO satellites will require travel rates of at least 8 degrees/second, thus the original specification for 10 degrees/second. Please review the Government?s original response. Is the travel speed correct? Response 1: Upon review:  The original specification of 10 degrees/second is correct. When the specs say transportable - do they mean vehicle transportable or man transportable? Response 2: The specifications listed for weight and size and number of components are our transport requirements.  If the company's antenna meets these requirements then our transportation requirements are satisfied.  These are the specified requirements.  Note: no change from original.   The total antenna system and associated transit cases must not weigh more than 900 pounds.   No subassembly in its transit case must weigh more then 150 pounds.   The number of subassemblies in their transit cases must not exceed 15 pieces.  Each subassembly must have a transit case. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This amendment provides answers to questions posed.


1.  Please clarify the current AFIS database size and conversion required as follows:
Current database size:  Approximately 250,000 total records
Current number of electronic records:  Approximately 65,000 records
Current number of card records:  Approximately 250,000 records
Number of electronic records to be converted:  Approximately 65,000 records
Number of card records to be converted:  Approximately 185,000 records

2.  Please define the method that you expect the winning vendor to extract the fingerprint images from the current "AFIS".  Are they stored in file system folders, Oracle BLOB?  Are they stored in NIST format (WSQ)?  Will current "AFIS" provider supply the schema of the data?  The vendor can extract the existing electronic records by copying them to an external drive.  They are NIST format records.
3.  Please clarify the expected database size as follows:
Tenprint Records:  Not less than 600,000 records 
Palmprint Records:  100,000 records
 Latent Records:  100,000 records
4.  Please clarify the expected number of palmprint searches:
Palm searches are expected to be no more than 100 per day
5.  Is the AFIX Tracker "AFIS" the same system that is hosting the current database of 65,000 records?  Yes
6.  The seven remote data entry/fingerprint query terminals state that the terminals shall support both live scan and card scan fingerprint acquisition.  Please explain how latent prints will be captured and how many workstations for latent capture are required.
Latent lifts will be scanned using the card scanner.  This will require the scanner to acquire images at 1000 dpi.  The remote query terminals should support latent query capabilities.
7.  Please confirm that the seven remote data entry/fingerprint query terminals do not require the capture and storage of a facial image.
The seven remote terminals do require the capability to capture and store digital images as noted in the specifications
8.  Does this mean pricing is to be sent in a separate email or can the pricing be sent with   the technical proposal as a separate file?    The pricing proposal shall be sent as a separate file in the emailed submission.
