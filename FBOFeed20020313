<DESC>The Program Support Center Acquisitions Branch knows of only a single source capable of accomplishing this requirement and intends to award a 12 month simplified acquisition for the  Office of Managed Care (OMC), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 444 North Capitol Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20001.  CSAT requires a Contractor to provide a continuous flow of expert information on issues related to State legislative policy issues affecting the financing of services and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.  Specifically, CSAT is interested in becoming aware on a timely basis of state drug and alcohol treatment legislation, particularly legislation related to financing and costs; treatment of special populations such as adolescents and women; the elderly; offenders in the community and institution criminal justice system; welfare recipients; and in providing a consistent and respected channel for disseminating that information and analyses back to the State legislative members, leadership, and staffs through a trusted and valued organization.  The objective of this requirement is to receive a continuous flow of information on specific issues from States legislators and their staffers; to produce updated chapters for the guidebook: "Treatment of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction: What State Legislators Need to Know;" to provide issue briefs on specific topics that require more detailed analyses; and to provide technical assistance to State legislators on issues related to financing and quality of treatment of substance related disorders.  Updates to the "Treatment of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction: What State Legislators Need to Know" will highlight the latest information on issues regarding costs associated with substance abuse treatment of women with children as it related to State parity legislation, drug and alcohol legislation as it affects the treatment of women and children(e.g. punishment vs. treatment), legislation related to inclusion of substance abuse assessments and referral to treatment in school-based health care programs, Medicaid coverage and managed care initiative, and legislation related to the inclusion of treatment in child health insurance programs have been identified by CSAT staff as of particular interest.  The Contractor shall write and electronically publish a newsletter every two weeks, titled "Snapshots," which addresses the trends and unique actions of legislators.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  The National Conference of State Legislatures is uniquely situated through its health policy tracking service and other established mechanisms (e.g. the annual meeting of health committee chairs and annual legislative conference) to provide CSAT with the ability to reach State legislatures in a timely fashion.  Interested parties capable of providing this requirement may submit a capability statement addressing their relationships with the State legislatures and ability to gain access to the information needed to update the type of information CSAT requires.  Responses are due within 15 days of the publication of this synopsis.  Responses shall be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition following consideration of responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All submissions are to be sent to Sophia S. Janus at the address above, referencing 02M009196.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) requires the services of a contractor to provide International Priority Airmail (IPA) presorting services to qualify for IPA discount program through the United States Postal Services (USPS). This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined by FAR 2.101) prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. This acquisition is subject to FAR subpart 13.5 regarding the application of simplified acquisition procedures.  This is a 100% small business set-aside, issued as a Request for Quotations Number SSA-RFQ-02-0131. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561499. The standard size is $5 million.  Quotations received from other than small business will be deemed unacceptable and given no further consideration. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-05. Proposals in response this RFQ shall be submitted by 3:00 p.m. local prevailing time, April 15, 2001.  BACKGROUND: SSA needs an experienced Contractor to furnish all personnel, vehicles, equipment and mail sorting production facilities and transportation services (except as provided by the U.S. Postal Service [USPS]) required to prepare International Priority Airmail (IPA) to earn postage discounts. The letter-size mail will be presented in USPS trays and will include a statement with each pickup, which contains the total number of mail pieces and the total weight. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this acquisition is to acquire the services of a Contractor to presort international mail, originating at two SSA sites located in the Woodlawn, MD, area to earn postage discounts.  Contractor may also be required twice annually to presort SSA mail which is produced by a printing contractor. STATEMENT OF WORK: Tasks 1.0: The Contractor shall perform the following tasks Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week, excluding Federal holidays. 1.1 Collect international mail no later than 4 p.m. on the specified days from The following two SSA central office locations: Annex Bldg., 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21235 and Security West Bldg.,1500 Woodlawn Dr., Baltimore, MD 21241. 1.2 Pick up mail one additional time per week in April and May at the Security West Building upon 24-hour advance notification from SSA to accommodate the Foreign Enforcement Mailing which may include up to 10,000 pieces per day. 1.3 Pick up or receive by air freight from a printing contractor two additional IPA workloads per year, upon at least one week's notification from SSA.  Each workload may include up to 250,000 pieces.  This mail will arrive from the printing contractor in envelopes with a permit imprint, sorted and boxed by country.  The Contractor must perform the additional sorting and processing required to ensure that these workloads are delivered to the Gateway Post Office of the Contractor's choice within three (3) work days after receipt. 1.4 Furnish all personnel (to include a uniformed driver), vehicles, equipment and mail sorting production facilities and transportation services (except as provided by USPS) required to prepare IPA to qualify for postage rate discounts under the USPS IPA discount program.  1.5 Sort the mail, affix their permit imprint for the appropriate rate of the destination country, bundle, sack, prepare documentation and present the mail to USPS as required under USPS IPA guidelines.  Contractor must comply with all applicable USPS regulations, to include the International Mail Manual. 1.6  Deposit the processed IPA mail at the Gateway Post Office of the Contractor's choice by 7 a.m. of the morning following the day of receipt, including a Saturday morning delivery of Friday's pickup of SSA mail. 1.7 Guarantee USPSacceptance of the volume generated by SSA no later than the next USPS acceptance day (Monday through Saturday, excluding Federal holidays) following turnover of the product to the Contractor. 1.8 Prepare a receipt at each pick-up site at the time SSA's mail is collected.  The receipt will state the weight of the shipment and the number of trays of mail as indicated by the SSA representative.  A copy of the receipt will be provided to SSA's designee at each pick-up site.  1.9 Return ineligible mail, e.g., domestic mail (including APO/FPO mail), insufficient address, via the Contractor's uniformed driver to the original pickup point with the next pickup. 1.10 Notify the Project Officer or Alternate Project Officer immediately if Contractor is unable to make a timely pick-up of SSA's mail due to inclement weather, vehicle breakdown or any other reason. 1.11 Weigh all mail picked up from SSA to assure that the contents received at the Contractor's facility are equal to those picked up from SSA. The Contractor will notify SSA immediately of any weight discrepancy (more than one pound), but no modification of the weight may be made by the Contractor without the permission of SSA. If a problem is discovered after the close 
of SSA business, the Contractor will contact the project officer or alternate
project officer at the start of SSA's next regular business day. 1.12 The SSA Project Officer or Alternate Project Officer (named at the time of award) will notify the Contractor of any emergency situations where pick-up will not be required, e.g., SSA closing due to bad weather. Tasks 2.0 SSA International Mail Workload: 2.1 A chart detailing the SSA Headquarters workloads is attached. All of the items fall into the category of letter mail. 2.2 The estimated annual mail volume for IPA from the two SSA facilities is 536,000 pieces of mail. This volume includes heavy mailings in May and June of approximately 135,000 pieces.  The volume from printing contractors may total 250,000 pieces from two workloads or 500,000 pieces annually.  The contract must allow for potential growth of 25 percent above this volume. CONTRACT DELIVERABLES: 3.0 The daily receipt from each SSA location as validated at the contractor's processing facility.  3.1 A monthly billing for fees and meter charges for number of pieces processed shall be presented directly to the SSA project officer for payment within 5 days after the end of each month. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Services shall be performed at the Contractor's facility.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall submit within 30 days of contract award, to a security survey to be performed by SSA Protective Security Personnel at the expense of the Government, i.e., the salaries and travel expenses of Government personnel to perform the security survey will not be the responsibility of the Contractor.  These individuals, to be designated by the project officer, will have the right to visit the Contractor's facility at any time during the performance of the contract.  Provide for the security of all SSA mail picked up and take all necessary precautions to insure against damage, loss or theft of SSA mail while it is in the Contractor's possession or at any time while SSA's mail is in the Contractor's facility.  The Contractor will be responsible for maintaining supervision, proper control and handling of the mail in order to prevent access to the mail by unauthorized individuals.  SSA considers its mail to be in the Contractor's possession from the point it is picked up by the Contractor at SSA until it is accepted by the USPS at the gateway post office. This is a critical requirement because SSA mail includes Social Security Number cards. (The mail will not contain checks or other negotiable instruments.) Provide a building that is properly secured in order to ensure adequate protection against theft of SSA mail. The facility will include: Physical security and access control systems, including alarms which only allow authorized personnel access to the facility and are capable of detecting and alerting security personnel of unauthorized entry attempts; immediate follow-up action must be taken in response to security alarm activations; Automatic fire detection system that is capable of detecting the incipient stages of a fire, which will include, at a minimum, combustion sensors, temperature rate-of-rise sensors, thermal sensors, and smoke sensors.  When the fire detection system is activated, it will identify the zone in which the fire is located and will activate an audible alarm to sound throughout the facility. In addition, the audible alarm will sound in at least one constantly supervised location, such as a guard station or local fire department.  Immediate follow-up action must be taken in response to fire alarm activations.  At least one Class C portable fire extinguisher, with a capacity of 15 pounds or greater, will be located within 50 feet of any point where SSA mail is being processed or staged. Fail-safe and override provisions will be provided for all electro-mechanical security devices (alarms, mantrap double door entries, access control systems, etc.), which can be activated in the event of an emergency. Adequate outside lighting of the facility, including all entrances and loading dock areas will be provided.  Provide secure vehicles to transport SSA mail.  Vehicles will be equipped with a high security lock to deter compromise.  The vehicle will be locked at all times when SSA mail is contained within it. Report any damage, loss or theft of SSA mail to the Project Officer or Alternate Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor's payments for SSA claims for monetary loss will be subject to verified SSA documentation. Maintain the security of SSA's mail by assuring that it is not opened or in any way tampered with, including that it is at no time left unattended unless it has been secured against possible tampering or theft.  Also, the Contractor will provide additional protective measures as follows: Secure all perimeter entrances to prevent unauthorized access from the outside, e.g., via locking hardware, spot-welding hinge pins, or similar method; Maintain in operation an intrusion detection system (IDS) to include perimeter alarms and motion detectors at the storage/work location. This IDS is to annunciate at a monitoring station that will require a security force to investigate the alarm activation. The Contractor will conduct monthly tests of this system and maintain a record of the test results on file, to be reviewed on request by Government security personnel. Maintain written procedures for protecting the mail in the event of an emergency, e.g., natural and man-made disasters, to be reviewed on request by Government security personnel. SECURITY CLEARANCES: Contractor personnel who require access to SSA facilities shall be required to undergo a background investigation, which will be conducted by the Government.  Such investigation shall require that Contractor employees submit a statement of personal history.  Non-U.S. citizens shall be required to provide a photocopy of their work authorization permit and Social Security
card.  Accordingly, the contractor should select only those persons who are
likely to meet the suitability requirements in order to reduce the likelihood
that employee(s) will be found unsuitable and not be allowed to work under the contract.  The Government shall have and exercise full and complete control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating clearances for contractor employees. Forms for background investigations will be made a part of the resultant contract.

Multimodal Cargo Container Transportation and Security

DTRS56-02-BAA-0002, OPEN ANNOUNCEMENT, POC Cynthia Barzey, (202) 366-6986

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration is soliciting information and descriptions (white papers), not to exceed five pages per project, on a technical or project activity addressing areas of interest described in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  White papers must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  Please include in a cover letter the contact information and a synopsis stating the concept, anticipated results and potential payoff to container security.  The cover letter is not included as part of the five- page limit.

SPECIAL NOTE:  This announcement will be open for twelve months and closes on March 12, 2003, unless otherwise amended.  The purpose of this BAA is to solicit white papers on innovative concepts or new applications of proven technology, methods or processes for reducing the risk and vulnerability of cargo container transportation systems to terrorist actions or mechanisms that may endanger the security of container transportation systems and ensure the security of end-to-end movement of cargo containers.  The objective is to achieve cargo container security on a global basis from the point of origin to the final destination in the United States via marine vessels and inter-modal systems, such as: ports, rail, truck, and highway systems. 

SCOPE:  This announcement is soliciting white papers on new or innovative methods, processes, and technologies that could be applied to container security through products, information systems, business practices and systems management.  Some examples of white paper topics could include: 

	*Real time risk management systems that can be scaled to address vulnerabilities and different levels of security threats. 
*Comprehensive risk profiling systems for container traffic including assessment of patterns, trends and performance of security systems. 
*Advanced systems for tracking container shipments from the point of loading and unloading at ports, conveyance and transportation in inter-modal systems and delivery to a customer. 
*Approaches for interlinking data on container information and cargo status including manifest information into a centralized national or global database.
*Systems for identifying critical gaps in flow of container cargo information, processing, analysis and fusion of information for tracking containers and cargo between foreign ports and U.S. ports.
*Technologies for remote or non-intrusive and timely detection of contraband materials including high energy release materials, explosives and weapons of mass destruction (WMD), chemical and biological agents, radiological materials or other hazardous materials or destruction mechanisms present in and around containers in single mode and multiple mode methods of cargo shipments.
*Automated tracking and communication systems to report the status of container movements in transportation with capabilities to detect intrusions, anomalies or any attempts that compromise container integrity and sealing.
*Advanced and tamper resistant sealing technologies including electronic seals for loaded and empty containers that produce a high level of sustained sealing integrity and performance, regardless of the mode of shipment and handling of the cargo.
*Automated methods and tests to rapidly validate container sealing, integrity and sealing performance. *Concepts for advanced and self-contained design of containers with built in capabilities for communication, intrusion detection and cargo status.
*Low cost and disposable electronic seals with electronic ID's that record container designation and continuously record status and provide tampering alerts.
*Long life battery technologies incorporated in containers to power electronic seals and self-contained communication capabilities.
*Rapid and systematic inspection techniques for timely detection of potential anomalies in container sealing at any stage of the container handling process. 

WHITE PAPERS:  DOT is soliciting white papers from state and local governments, consortia, industry and academia on their activities dealing with the topics described above.  The concepts should address one of the following two types of Research and Development (R&D) and product implementation: Type 1 - Innovative application of proven products methods or systems that are potentially deployable to container security practice within six (6) months or Type 2: - New concepts for products, which, if proven successful, could be developed and deployed for application to container security practice in the near term, within eighteen (18) months.  The proposal should clearly indicate the type of proposed investigation.  Each white paper, not to exceed five pages, must include sufficient information for the panel to evaluate against the evaluation criteria.  The evaluation criteria are listed below.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: 
1)	Technical merit of the innovation for application to container security practice,
2)	Potential payoff for improving the security of container transportation,
3)	Time scale for developing and/or implementing products and results to practice, 
4)	Cost for completing the development and/or implementation and cost sharing, and 
5)	Technical background and institutional resources available to perform the project. 

All of the above factors are of equal importance. 

TECHNICAL REVIEW/EVALUATION:  A panel will meet monthly to review the white papers submitted in response to this announcement.  The panel will consist of experts from modal administrations within the Department of Transportation (DOT) and from other agencies.  The panel will use the stated evaluation criteria.  Offerors will be advised of the panel's recommendations. 

RSPA intends to present the white papers selected by the panel to the appropriate administrations and program offices within the Department of Transportation for further consideration.  The applicable DOT office will then contact the offeror about the disposition of its white paper.  The offeror will also be provided guidelines for preparing and submitting full proposals for evaluation and negotiation, and for subsequent award of contracts or agreements.

GENERAL INFORMATION: This Broad Agency Announcement can be downloaded via the Internet at: http://www.rspa.dot.gov under Procurement Opportunities.  In all correspondence to the RSPA Office of Contracts and Procurement, please reference the BAA No. DTRS56-02-BAA-0002.  All white papers must be submitted to Cynthia D. Barzey, Research and Special Programs Administration, ATTN: DMA-30, 400 Seventh Street SW, Room 7104, Washington, D.C., 20590.
 

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT: This FedBizOps notice, in conjunction with further announcement details available from the RSPA procurement Internet site address identified above, constitutes the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2).  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued.  AT THIS TIME FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN APPROPRIATED FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.  NOTHING IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY DOT/RSPA TO AWARD ANY OF THE PROJECT AREAS IDENTIFIED ABOVE.  Evaluation panels will periodically review all white papers for responsiveness to the evaluation areas stated in this BAA.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to renew annual maintenance on 195 copies of ENVISION Software provided by an existing contract with Future Tech Systems, Inc.  The software and other support services are used to support Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) activities.  This software provides the tools, both graphical and textual, for systems requirements analysts to document requirements for new systems or requirements for the modification of existing systems.  The Envision tool has and continues to support the Redesigned Disability System development process and permits SSA to design models supporting various systems analysis techniques.   SSA is currently using models supporting data modeling (e.g., Entity Relationship Diagrams), process modeling (e.g., Data Flow Diagrams), screen-flow modeling, and system development modeling (e.g., Hierarchy and Structure Charts).  This software is installed and licensed on several personal computers located at SSA's Headquarters in Baltimore, MD.  Software maintenance shall include Telephone Technical Support Services and Software Upgrades.  The maintenance agreement shall provide for any upgrade or new version of the software within 60 days of its commercial release.

The maintenance contractor shall also provide hotline telephone support available from 11:00 a.m. through 7:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  Hotline support technicians shall provide the following types of support for the software: 1) technical assistance in installing, configuring and operating the software with the targeted hardware; 2) resolving problems concerning the software/hardware configuration and interface; 3) explaining the operational characteristics of the software product; 4) answering questions about the specific capabilities of the software package; 5) answering questions concerning local area network communications, including concepts; and 6) provide any other technical support useful to SSA personnel.  The hotline support technicians shall provide a solution within one workday of the initial contact for 95% of all calls within any given month during the maintenance period.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Description: Provide high temperature spectral hemispherical (hemispherical near-normal or near-normal hemispherical) reflectance and transmittance measurements of ten NASA-provided thermal barrier coatings over the wavenumber range of 500 to 12500 cm-1. Maximum temperature required to be over 1400°C. Reflectance and transmittance measurements are to be performed for each specimen at this prescribed sequence of specimen temperatures: at room temperature, 1000°C, 1200°C, 1400°C (minimum), and a final measurement at room temperature. Contributions from specimen thermal radiation to reflectance and transmittance measurements must be eliminated. NASA/GRC plans to purchase from Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 13.501 in conjunction with FAR Part 6).  This procurement for high temperature spectral hemispherical reflectance/transmittance measurements shall be awarded to Advanced Fuel Research because they have developed their own unique instrumentation for making these measurements at temperatures as high as 1000C.  These measurements will be performed in order to evaluate how well thermal barrier coatings developed at NASA function as radiation barriers.  These coatings are used on components in hot sections of turbine engines where temperatures routinely go above 1000C.  Because the present procurement is for testing of coatings that will see service temperatures in excess of 1400 C it is crucial that we measure the radiative barrier properties of these coatings at similar temperatures.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number RFQ DG133F-02-RQ-0007 is issued as a request for quotations. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. This procurement action is full and open. The associated North America Industry Classification System is 541710.   A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if it size standard is 500 employees.  A list of contract line item numbers and items, quantities and units of measure include:  CLIN 0001A, Year One, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001B, Year Two, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001C, Year Three, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001D, Year Four, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day; CLIN 0001E, Year Five, Independent Expert, Unit of Measure: Day.  
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires a Center of Independent Experts (CIE) with the requisite technical and scientific expertise to provide impartial and comprehensive comments and practical advice through outside peer reviews on scientific issues related to the living marine resource management mandates of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Subjects for reviews may include: stock assessments and population modeling methods for fish, marine mammals, or sea turtles; field sampling procedures or protocols; and review of existing and/or design of new scientific programs or management strategies. The CIE shall handle reviewer selection and ensure that reviewers are free from influences of groups or organizations with vested interests in marine resource usage by obtaining written assurances of no conflict of interest from all reviewers. After reviewer selection, the CIE shall make all necessary travel arrangements for the reviewers; copy and distribute background materials provided by NMFS; and provide intermediate status reports, final written reviews from each reviewer, and a complete accounting of distributed funds. To ensure that the reviews provided to NMFS are of the highest possible quality, the CIE shall thoroughly examine status and draft reports submitted by the reviewers for content, clarity, and compliance with NMFS' task order before passing completed reports to NMFS for final approval. Unless the requirement for a consensus report is specified in the task order, each reviewer's report shall be submitted individually to NMFS. Reviews facilitated by the CIE will vary in scope and duration. Most reviewers will be asked to carry out short-term, narrowly focused assignments requiring approximately 1-3 weeks of their time. The deliverable for a short-term review would typically be a 10-30 page report. Some reviewers could be involved in longer-term projects with a wider scope and more comprehensive deliverable. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPERTS: The reviewers chosen by the CIE must be demonstrably highly reputable experts in the field that is the subject of their review; they must have be able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the applied nature of the science that supports NMFS' mission; and they must be free from even the appearance of any conflict of interest. Reviewers should have a PhD or equivalent degree in a relevant field, five or more years of relevant experience, ten or more peer-reviewed publications in a relevant field, and have a record of successful participation in working groups or scientific review panels.  CAPABILITIES OF THE CIE: The contractor for the CIE must be a research institution with an international reputation in fisheries science, with capabilities to identify and obtain the services of appropriate domestic and foreign scientists, to evaluate and improve the quality of draft reports, to handle the logistics of arranging travel and distributing materials to all regions of the United States, and to manage and administer domestic and international contracts. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The contractor will be selected based on past performance; the proposed processes for running the CIE, selecting reviewers, and avoiding conflicts of interest; and cost. The period of performance shall be July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to extend its Center Operations Support Services (COSS) contract on a sole source basis.  The COSS contract furnishes the necessary management, personnel, equipment and materials (not otherwise provided by the Government) to operate and maintain facilities and all related functions at MSFC located in Huntsville, Alabama.  The work can be broken down into the following elements:  Management, Engineering and Planning, Operation and Maintenance, and Program Support.  The current contract completion date is August 31, 2002, and the services defined above will be continued for up to six months (a three-month base period with three one-month options) through February 28, 2003. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services defined above from Eggerton, Germishausen, and Greer, Inc. (EG&G) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  This extension will allow NASA/MSFC sufficient time to complete the follow-on recompetition for the COSS contract (which is in process) and transition to the successor contract.  Safe, efficient operation of the facilities, as well as timely support to users, are key factors in the work under the contract.  Given the duration of this extension, no other sources could be expected to take over for the period specified and be expected to perform at an acceptable level due to the training requirements and complexity of the functions involved in performing the job. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on the Response Date identified in this notice.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB), plans to procure a Faxiton X-Ray machine with Faxitron X-Ray Corp., 1670 Barclay Blvd., Buffalo Grove, Illinois, 60089.  The LMCB investigates basic cellular processes of homeostasis, growth, division and differentiation, with an emphasis on the molecular biology of chromosomes and the cell nucleus.  Research at the eukaryotic genome maintenance unit is aimed at understanding how living organisms safeguard their genomes against DNA damaging agents, such as irradiation.  The fruit-fly Drosophila is used as a model organism for these studies.  This particular X-ray machine will allow the laboratory to X-ray irradiate fruit flies at different developmental stages to induce cellular damages and to generate mutations.  The X-ray machine will generate DNA damages and facilitate a better understanding of how Drosophila cells detect and repair these damages.  The machine will also be used to induce mutations that cause defects in DNA damage repair.  These mutational studies help the laboratory to elucidate specific functions of genes involved in damage repair.  The required instrument shall have a shelfed chamber on which specimen would be placed.  The individual researcher must have control over the dosage of irradiation from 100 to 10,000 rads.  The machine must be able to deliver 10,000 rads for a period shorter than ten (10) minutes so that the specimen will not be dried during irradiation.  In addition, the instrument must be compact so that it can be placed in an easily accessible place.  The following minimum features are required for the Faxitron X-ray machine: 1)  >1000 Rad/min so that a dosage of 10,000 Rad can be delivered at less than ten (10) minutes.  This is critical for the experiments in two ways; (a) fruit flies will not be killed due to desiccation in the irrational chamber and, (b) fruit flies will still be at sleep which facilitates post-irradiation manipulation; 2) machine must be "self-cooling" so that no external source of coolant is needed; 3) radiation dosage can be very finely adjusted by changing the timer at one-second increments; 4) motor driven turntable which provides a means of improving uniformity of the absorbed radiation dose and; 5) machine is relatively small, allows easy placement in the laboratory and easy transportation.  Faxitron X-ray Corp is the only source known to the NCI Researcher that can provide the aforementioned X-ray machine.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington, D.C. time), on March 28, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted. Faxed capability statements will not be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, provide one original and three copies.

<DESC>NA DESC:   The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington (CAC-W) on behalf of the CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Science & Technology Division proposes to negotiate a Sole Source Basis  an  acquisition with The University of Mississippi of Oxford, Mississippi. The contractor will conduct research and development effort is to assess buried mine detection capability using a combination of seismic/acoustics and a high-resolution ground penetrat ing radar.  The acoustics sensor will detect mines by inducing seismic vibrations in the ground using airborne sound and detecting increased surface vibrations over the mine using a laser Doppler Vibrometer. The high-resolution ground penetrating radar wil l complement the acoustics sensor with the goal of providing increased detection probability and a reduced false alarm rate. The two sensors will be integrated on a common motorized vehicle. Two separate arrangements will be investigated: 1) Close in detec tion in which the sensors need only maintain 30 cm. of ground clearance. 2) Standoff detection in which detections must be made at distances exceeding 7 meters in front of the vehicle. The contractor will research ways to increase the forward speed by use of multiple lasers, whole field interferometry, of other techniques. The contractor will model the acoustics phenomenology. The length of the proposed contract shall be for 42 months. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U .S.C. 2304(c)(1). All requests for information must be in writing or via e-mail. You may forward proposals to Richard Bonney, Contract Specialist, at the richard.bonney@cacw.army.mil. Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communication-Electronics Command (CECOM), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Humanitarian Demining Office proposes a non-competitive acquisition with The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) (Defencetek ) in cooperation with Mechem Consultants (a division of Denel (Pty) Limited) to research, develop, demonstrate and validate individual Lower limb protection items in support of Humanitarian Demining activities.  The overall purpose being to offer an altern ative source of energy absorbent other than that of a manual deminer's foot and lower limbs and thereby determine the design, material and other criteria for foot and lower limb protection as well as establishing the level and parameters of that protection .  Currently, there is no appropriate lower limb protection for deminers against the direct effects from stepping on Anti-Personnel landmines. Current, available lower limb protective equipment was tested in the Lower Extremities Assessment Program (LEAP) in 2000.  Most deminers do not wear protective footwear because it has been shown to be ineffective and in some cases more deadly to the operator.  Metal reinforced boots often become additional shrapnel during an explosion resulting in greater damage to t he legs and groin area. The proposed work will attempt to demonstrate new advancements in the area of deminer lower limb protection technology.  This project will use the extensive knowledge that Mechem Consultants has in blast protective vehicles to devel op new protective footwear, which will not only significantly reduce the damage the AP landmine inflicts on the contact foot of the deminer but also reduce dramatically the further effects on the rest of the deminer's body. The duration of this effort is 9  months.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above Lower Limb Protection Device may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must possess technical expertise and/or experience building prosthetic/extended reach devices.  Res ponses should be no longer than five (5) pages.  Responses are to be received via email not later than 29 April 2002 at 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email, telephone requests for additional  information will not be honored. You may forward responses to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address:  pat.davis@cacw.army.mil with a copy to susan.Whelan@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.

<DESC>In August 1998 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) competitively awarded through the GSA FSS Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Software Performance Systems (SPS) for software development and maintenance support using Gentia software.  SPS has developed, enhanced, and maintained the Patent Operational Planning and Budget Administration System (OPBUDGET) to the present and has provided on-going support to facilitate the USPTO's initiatives of reducing patent pendency and enhancing the quality of patent examinations.  The USPTO subsequently awarded an eleven (11) month sole source BPA to SPS beginning in October 2001 to continue support of the USPTO's mission critical decision support system OPBUDGET.  The USPTO now intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SPS a cost plus fixed fee contract for the acquisition of continued developmental support and enhancements using the Gentia software and database development environment.  The period of performance will be for eighteen (18) months with an expected start on April 1, 2002 and continuing through September 30, 2003.  During the 18-month time frame the USPTO intends to transition from the Gentia software and database development environment to a new state-of-the-art environment for OPBUDGET.  This transition will be accomplished with other contractors developing and later enhancing and maintaining the new state-of-the-art environment for OPBUDGET.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Unacceptable cost, schedule, and technical risks would be incurred if another contractor were selected for the OPBUDGET effort.  Awarding these services to any other source would result in a cost duplication the USPTO is not in a financial position to bear, jeopardize large investments the USPTO has made in developing OPBUDGET, and result in unacceptable delays.  This is NOT a request for proposals, nor will one be made available.  However, concerns that respond must furnish detailed information describing capabilities to deliver the above services to:  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Office of Procurement, Box 6, Washington, DC  20231.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service will prequalify offerors capable of conducting The Household Diary Study for Postal Fiscal Years 2003, 2004 and 2005, as described in Attachment 01, Statement of Work. Prequalification is a process where a supplier?s ability to meet specific Postal Service requirements is evaluated.  The primary objective of The Household Diary Study is to determine the content of the mail going into and out of households so that informed decisions can be made regarding the mailstream and how it is affected by the Postal Service?s rate structure.  The Study provides a comprehensive description of mail originating and destinating in households and of customer attitudes toward mail.  THIS PROCUREMENT HAS TWO PHASES.  The first phase requires interested suppliers to submit prequalification statements in accordance with the instructions contained in the solicitation.  Prequalification does not constitute a contract award.  It is the business decision of the Contracting Officer to prequalify.  It is the intent of the USPS to award this contract using the prequalified suppliers.  The USPS will review prequalification statements in accordance with the solicitation.  Upon completion of this review, all companies responding to this announcement will be notified of the USPS? decision. Not all qualified suppliers responding to this announcement will necessarily be placed on the prequalified list.  The prequalified list may be limited to suppliers considered most qualified to meet the USPS? requirements or to a small list that will provide adequate competition.  THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PREQUALIFICATION STATEMENTS IS APRIL 1, 2002.  Based on the written prequalification statements, all of the offerors evaluated as prequalified will be contacted to schedule competitive oral presentations of their proposals for accomplishing the work under the contract.  Offerors making oral presentations must submit a price/business proposal no later than April 30, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to place a one (1) year basic contractual effort for the development and validation of a simulation model for predicting the performance of continuous open shear roll mill (SRM) for propellant processing at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP), Radford, Virginia. The  effort consists of: converting the numerical predictive model into an interactive simulation software and to develop an on-line thermal imaging  control system software to interface with 200mm shear roll mill at RFAAP. The  interactive simulation software/model and thermal imaging control system must  be sufficiently robust to make predictions of SRM performance at several sizes (200-mm, 300-mm) when processing various propellant formulations such as AA-2 and JA-2.  The contractor shall interface with Alliant Techsystems Inc., the  operating contractor at Radford AAP, and make available an on-line thermal  image camera(s) to collect temperature profiles data on the SRM during the wet inert simulant runs and the initial runs of live AA-2 propellant at RFAAP. Data  generated from the previous JA-2 runs at Nitrochemie in Germany and data  collected from the live AA-2 trial runs and the wet inert simulant runs on the ATK 200mm Continuous Open SRM at RFAAP shall be used to fine tune and validate the numerical mathematical model. The solicitation will be released on 27 March 2002.

<DESC>NA The US Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Humanitarian Demining Team proposes a non-competitive acquisition with Pearson Engineering Ltd. for the advanced development of the Mine Cleari ng Survivable (MSC) Vehicle.  The MCS Vehicle is a purpose built mobile system for performing mechanical tasks in support of humanitarian demining clearance operations.  The system serves as a mid range platform filling the gap between personal mine equipm ent/mini mechanical systems and demining systems based on large construction style equipments.  The design of the MCS Vehicle draws heavily on overcoming many of the limitations with the existing design of the Survivable Demining Tractor.  Specifically, th e contractor will perform a design and development effort on the MCS Vehicle with the goals of improving mechanical reliability, improving functionality, increasing survivability, improving logistical transportability, and decreasing production and mainten ance costs.  Several innovative design features will be incorporated to give the system unmatched levels of isolation and protection for the operator and high value components.   These features are in addition to more conventional protection/survivability methods that are designed into the Survivable Demining Tractor (SDT) and other blast resistant vehicles.  The cost-to-build for the Mine Clearing Survivable Vehicle will be required to remain within reach of many of the humanitarian mine clearance programs  which are effectively barred from using mechanical equipment due to the high procurement costs of mid-sized and large commercial equipment.  The system will also be designed to be compatible with several existing mine clearing implements developed by the Government previously, as well as numerous pieces of commercially available vegetation and earth working implements.  The contractor will design and fabricate the system and all components, design and implement a test program to evaluate and prove the auto motive, functional, and survivable features of the system, and document and deliver one working system to the Government.     The contract requirements are specific to the Mine Clearing Survivable Vehicle and require performance by a source that has expert  knowledge of its predecessor, the Survivable Demining Tractor developed by Pearson Engineering.  The duration of this effort is 18  months.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Sourc e and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above Mine Clearing Survivable Vehicle may submit a quote that shall b e considered by the agency.  Offerors must possess technical expertise and experience with the Survivable Demining Tractor.  Responses should be no longer than five (5) pages.  Responses are to be received via email within 45 calendar days of the date of t his notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to Mr. Richard Bonney, Contract Specialist at: richard.bonney@cacw.army.mil.  Ac knowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

A ? REQUIREMENT
This Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) requests proposals for Advanced Beam Control/Compensation Technologies.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Phillips Research Site (PRS), Directed Energy Directorate (DEBA), Kirtland AFB, NM solicits proposals for the Analysis, Engineering, Research or Simulation for Optical and Laser Systems (AERoSOLS) program. Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) and Airborne Laser (ABL) transmitting systems, including the extended-range ABL (ER ABL) scenarios, require advanced beam control/compensation techniques to correct for the effects of atmospheric turbulence.   The purpose of this acquisition is to contract for research, analysis, simulation and instrumentation development work relevant to beam control and atmospheric characterization.  The main technical objective is to perform modeling, simulation and analysis of advanced concepts and to baseline them for testing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Labs (MIT/LL) Advanced Concepts Laboratory (ACL).  Concepts with promising ACL results will be field tested at North Oscura Peak (NOP). If they show promise there, they will be candidates for insertion into the systems mentioned above.   A secondary objective is to develop or support innovative techniques for measuring and predicting atmospheric turbulence for the laser or imaging systems of interest. A third objective is to improve or advance instrumentation state-of-the-art for systems or experiments to advance the first two technical objectives.

1.  Concept Generation and Validation:  This objective seeks innovative concepts to improve tracking and atmospheric compensation for ABL, ATL, or ER ABL missions. It may include the analysis, simulation, experimental planning, experiment participation and data analysis, to verify the efficacy of said concepts. 

2.  Simulation and Analysis:  This objective provides for analysis and simulation in support of DEBA's various efforts in ABL, ATL, ER ABL and atmospheric turbulence measurement and prediction. It also includes tasks to provide data analysis of experimental data taken in support of these efforts. 

3.  Instrumentation Improvements and Support:  Design, build and implement Instrumentation primarily, but not exclusively, in support of experiments at NOP, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), and ACL at MIT/LL as well as various atmospheric measurement efforts  

4.  Atmospheric Characterization Efforts:  This objective provides for atmospheric characterization efforts that involve development of instrumentation and systems, data collection, analysis of data, and simulation of results.  The instrumentation development involves developing or improving sensors, data collection systems, and platforms. Data collection includes using these new systems as well as other existing systems as specified by the government.  Analysis of data includes observations from such systems as well as from other sources as satellite-obtained observations, radiosonde observations, and weather maps.  Simulations include efforts related to the measurement programs for incorporating estimated effects.


B ? DESCRIPTION:  1.  AFRL will not issue a separate solicitation. AFRL is distributing this PRDA electronically through FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov.

E-PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: 1. Proposals will be evaluated by a peer or scientific review process which outlined in AFMC FARS 5335.016-90 or 5335.90, as appropriate, using the following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance.   (1)  The overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal, including capabilities and related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are an integral factor for achieving proposal objectives; and (2) importance to AFRL/DEBA programs; and (3) availability of funds.  No further evaluation factors will be used in selecting proposals.  AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  2.  Affordability will be evaluated using the factors of reasonableness and realism. 3. This evaluation will lead to a categorization of proposals as Category 1, Category II, or Category III.  4. Proposal categories are as follows:  (i) Category I:  Well conceived, scientifically and technically sound proposals pertinent to program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results.  Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals; (ii) Category II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals requiring further development and are recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I; (iii) Category III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs.  5. Following proposal categorization, AFRL will enter into negotiations with selected Category I offerors. Cost realism will be assessed for those offers selected for negotiation and price reasonableness will be determined prior to making any award. If AFRL enters into negotiations with an offeror, but is unable to reach agreement, that proposal may be displaced by a lower rated proposal. AFRL may at that time enter into negotiations with an offeror not originally contacted for negotiations.

F ? OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR AWARD: 1. In order to receive a DOD contract, offerors must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program utilizing a DD 1540 form. For more information and on-line registration with CCR, see http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil. 2.  Interested concerns shall have or be capable of obtaining a SECRET facilities clearance.  It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/CCAL/ for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal.   3. In accordance with FAR 16.301-3(a)(1), before an offeror can receive a cost-reimbursement contract, the offeror must possess an accounting system that is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.

G- MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION: 1. This PRDA does not commit the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract. 2. An Ombudsman has been appointed to mediate concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions. The Ombudsman does not participate in proposal evaluation or contractor selection. The Ombudsman can work with responsible acquisition officials to respond to concerns, but will not detract from the authority of the Project Manager or Grants/Contracting Officer. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain the confidentiality of sources. The Ombudsman at Phillips Research Site is Mr. Eugene DeWall, Director of Contracting, Det 8 AFRL/PK, 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773; (505) 846-4979.

MUST BE RATED FOR OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT IN HOUSTON, TX.       Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued.  The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions no. 21-23 submitted by potential offerors.  Questions and answers 1-20 have been posted under amendment 2.  Question 21.    The required internal dimensions and the required external dimensions do not allow for placement of the refrigeration-condensing unit.  Several previous questions have been asked regarding this matter with the answer being to refer to section 2.a of the specification.  Can the condensing unit skid be located adjacent to the environmental chamber or can it be remotely located? Answer 21.  Yes, either is ok as long as you are prepared to set it up for us.  We want a finished product.  If an additional "footprint" is needed, then the manufacturer may separate conditioning system, temperature recorders, etc… into different units from the basic structure that is limited to fitting within these external dimensions; however, those separate units as well as all necessary labor, equipment, tools, materials and certifications to connect up those separate units on site while following all applicable NASA Johnson Space Center site requirements are responsibility of manufacturer.   Question 22.    The specification requires electric defrost.  With the possibility of explosive vapors inside the room, would hot gas defrost be a better option for this application?  Please advise. Answer 22.  No comment. Question 23.    The rooms will be installed on a 6" high structural base.  The insulated floor panels will be 4" high.  This will provide an overall height of 10" above grade.  Do we need to provide a ramp?  Please advise. Answer 23.  No you do not need to provide a ramp.  However, you may be able to sell a ramp if you itemize the basic requirements and show the cost of the ramp separately.   The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS).

<DESC>As stated in the solicitation, the government intends to award without discussions.  Therefore, communication (also referred to as exchanges) with offerors regarding their proposals or the evaluation proceedings will be limited by the protocols in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 

I will notify all interested parties (offerors) if their proposal is successful or unsuccessful for each functional area applied for as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and will avoid exchanges until that time.  Unsuccessful parties will be afforded an opportunity for debriefing along with notification as being unsuccessful.  

Things I can not disclose at this time include, but are not limited to, both the number of offers and the identity of other offerors.

Some parties have asked me to verify if their proposal was received.  I need proof of the authenticity of the requester and that the requester is empowered by the offeror before I will share that information.  The best way to accomplish this is to send in a letter to me on corporate letterhead.  I will accept the letter by mail to me at - Matt T. Verhulst (6TA), GSA/FTS, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO  64131 -, by way of fax to me at 816.926.7474, or via e-mail to - hubzone@gsa.gov - with an attached scanned copy of the letter.  In response to what is ostensibly a valid request I will simply acknowledge receiving or not receiving a package from that source.

Please consider the preceding before attempting to contact me regarding proposals or the evaluations at this juncture.

<DESC>NASA-Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby seeking capabilities from large, small (SB), small disadvantaged (SDB), HUBZone and Women-owned small businesses (WOB) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the anticipated competition of the R & D Engineering Services contract.  The potential contract will combine support activities for the R&D Services Directorate at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California.  The scope of work includes the following: Research and Development Engineering Services, and Hardware Development Services.  Currently, these requirements are satisfied through multiple contracts.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized over the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS).  It is the potential offerors’ responsibility to monitor this URL site for the release of any forthcoming solicitation or synopsis.  While the Government acknowledges that many companies have the capability to perform any one or even several of these functions, the Government expects to contract with a firm that has the overall capability to manage this total effort.  The Government is requesting from interested large, SBs, SDBs, WOBs, and HUBZone businesses a capability statement of three pages or less indicating the ability to perform all or parts of the effort described herein.  ARC is an ISO 9001 facility and has been recommended to receive OSHA VPP Star Certification later this year; and consequently, interested parties will need to address experience working within these environments.  Since the current contract requirements are performed on-site at ARC, it is believed that the solicitation will not require a provision for facilities. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be for a contract with a term in excess of five years. It is not know at this time what the term of the contract will be. Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether the firm is large, SB, SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or WOB; number of years in business, affiliate information; parent company, joint venture partners.  Potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact – address and telephone number); positive or negative comments with respect to a contract having a term longer that five years (e.g. impacts on staffing, impacts on cost, performance, employee morale, etc.). In addition to this announcement, a draft acquisition plan (DAP) will be posted to this synopsis. This plan provides additional information on the pending procurement and also requests industry input on a variety of questions mentioned throughout the document. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified about the outcome of the Government’s review of solicited information.  Failure to respond to this synopsis does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to NASA Ames Research Center, Attn: Mark Lefler, Contracting Officer, Moffett Field, California 94035-1000 no later than March 31, 2002.  Responses may be faxed to (650) 604-4984 Attn: Mark Lefler or emailed to mlefler@mail.arc.nasa.gov

<DESC>US Special Operation Command (USSOCOM) is issuing this request for information (RFI) to sources interested in providing (off-the-shelf) (COTS)/non-development item (NDI) for underwater adhesives. This RFI is for both foreign and domestic industries. 

NDI includes, but not limited to, items that are under initial development, but not yet in production, and reasonably can be expected to be in the status of production with ready articles for comparative testing by March 2003 or sooner.


Underwater in this RFI means that the adhesive must be applied underwater, must cure underwater in less then 30 seconds when applied to discs with diameters from 3 to 8 inches and a thickness of approximately one half inch. The disc can be any material from aluminum, brass, plastic, etc. Open air (above water) dispensing and curing is also desirable.

The curing process can be aided by artificial means, such as light, heat, etc. Once the discs are cured they should be able to hold weights varying from 20 to 100 lbs. The discs should be able to attach to varying surfaces, i.e., smooth/clean, smooth/rusty and barnacles/slimy.  Some minimal surface preparation will be done, the procedure should take minimal time and not require complex tools.

The adhesive kit should be as light as possible and should not interfere with the operator's capability to perform other tasks. A maximum time of one-minute from the operator selecting the target, applying a disc to its surface, applying and curing the adhesive aid and leaving the area is desirable.

If a two part mixture is proposed, it is required that the operator squeeze both tubes and the resulting mix will be ejected through one nozzle onto the disc that is to be attached to any of the above mentioned surfaces.

System adhesion should be performed at temperatures varying from 0 degrees centigrade to 25 degrees centigrade at depths varying from 5 to 80 feet. The water clarity will vary from clear to murky, murky to muddy. USSOCOM would prefer one adhesive compound to meet the aforementioned application, but more than one configuration will be considered.

The vendor's response to this market survey must include:
1)  Technical description of the product, including specifications, photographs of experimental underwater adhesion.
2)  Description of the system's maturity. Is this a new product (R&D) or one that is in production?
3)  Is the system fielded? Who is the user? Is the product commercially available?
4)  Test qualification history of the product, if any.
5)  Provide cost and delivery schedule to provide test quantity in year 2003. 
Provide cost to purchase various quantities.
6)  If item is of foreign origin, the vendor must include information on local government/military/representative contract information, if any.

The government may be interested in purchasing one full unit for evaluation in the US, prior to committing to larger buys. The government is also interested in a demonstration of the system in the US, where the US will absorb the cost of the demo.

This notice seeks to compare COTS/NDI solutions to ongoing developmental efforts at a future date.

This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a request for proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by USSOCOM to procure said equipment. No solicitation document exists at the present time.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED

<SUBJECT>A -- NIMH Center for Genetic Studies
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) plans to modify Contract N01MH80004 with Washington University (St. Louis) "NIMH Center for Genetic Studies" in accordance with provisions of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c )(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed modification will extend the contract period of performance and add funds to continue the contract to allow sufficient time to award a Cooperative Agreement for the continuation of this requirement.

The objective of contract N01MH80004 is to: (1) receive clinical, diagnostic, pedigree structure, and other data and blood samples from a large number of organizations performing genetics studies with grant and contract support from NIMH; (2) process these data and materials to create and maintain electronic databases, high-quality lymphoblastoid cell lines, and DNA samples that are incorporated with comparable existing data and biomaterials in the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative (http://www-grb.nimh.nih.gov/gi.html); and (3) widely distribute all data and materials in the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative to qualified investigators in the scientific community.

The current contract was competed on a full and open competitive basis, and awarded to Washington University, with a subcontract to Rutgers University for repository operations.  Due to the strong interest of researchers, policy makers and others, the volume of blood delivered to the contractor has been significantly greater than anticipated when the contract was awarded.  The NIMH plans to make a new award for this requirement, since the submission of large volumes of blood to the NIMH Center for Genetics Studies is expected to continue through at least 2004.

This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. Please contact David Eskenazi, NIMH Contracting Officer, at 301-443-2696 or deskenaz@mail.nih.gov for further information. No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>--New Generation Army Target System (NGATS) Industry Day Forum
<DESC>NA GENERAL:   The Army Targets Management Office, will host an Industry Day Forum on Thursday, April 11, 2002, at Huntsville, AL.  The purpose of the forum is to provide interested parties and potential offerors information and an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed NGATS program plans and solicitations.  Specifically, the forum will focus on presenting the Army's vision for the development, integration, and fielding of NGATS live fire training ranges.  All firms who produce target hardware, battlefield effec ts simulator, target control systems, target scoring systems, live fire ranges, or have experience in integration test and installation of similar distributed component systems are encouraged to attend this forum.  At some time following the Industry Day F orum, the Government anticipates issuing a Request for Information asking for comments and suggestions from interested industry on the program plan, schedule, and technical aims of the NGATS program. BACKGROUND:   The Army Targets Management Office intends to develop a New Generation Army Target System to replace existing target systems on live fire ranges.  This NGATS target system will be made up of families of targetry components that are interchangeable and prov ide the required performance at a low life cycle cost.  Compatible NGATS components will be deployed on Army training ranges in a sequential or blocked program where each block represents increases in performance, reductions in cost, or both. The NGATS pro gram is scheduled to begin fielding ranges in late FY06 with a Block I NGATS system.  The schedule for fielding Block II or subsequent blocks will be set at a later date. In order to implement Block I, the Government has begun requirement definition and system design activities with a design integration contractor, CSC Inc of Huntsville, AL.  As a part of this design activity, the Government, along with the design integrati on contractor, will develop and provide system requirements and interfaces that target system components must meet.   During the remainder of FY02, FY03, and most of FY04, the Government intends to sponsor a series of Industry Days including the design integration contractor and interested target industry companies to present the progress of the design and interface defin itions.  Technical input from industry is strongly desired at these meetings.  Industry comment on the progress and direction of the Government's activities will impact the content of the interfaces that NGATS Block I targetry components must meet.  The Go vernment's intent is to have a family of each type of system component that will meet the interface requirements and provide a spectrum of price/performance to satisfy the large spectrum of Army range types and requirements. Beginning in late FY03 and continuing through FY04, the Government plans to operate a facility at the Redstone Arsenal where targetry component manufacturers can have their products tested for conformance to the requirements/interfaces. In late FY04, the G overnment will contract on a competitive basis, with a Production Integration Contractor to integrate and test a range system consisting of components that have been shown to meet the requirements/interfaces.  Following the successful tests/demonstrations of the prototype targetry system, the Production Integration Contractor will  install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges.  Options for post warranty support of the installed ranges will be included in this contract for the use of range operators.  I nstallation of NGATS Block I ranges is expected to continue for several years. NGATS Block II and any subsequent releases will be produced as a result of future procurement actions to introduce technology advancement and satisfy new training requirements.   Such releases will be integrated and tested by a competitively selected produ ction integration contractor who upon successful test/demonstration will be directed to i nstall targetry systems on Army live fire ranges. The Production Integration contract will include a Hardware, Software and Services Exclusionary provision that will impose a restraint upon future business.  This is necessary to preclude potential conflicts of interest and prevent the existence of a confl icting interest that might bias the Production Integration Contractor's judgment.  Please see subpart 9.5, Federal Acquisition Regulation, 'Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest'. ADMISSION:   Admission will be by reservation only.  Reservations should be either faxed or e-mailed by 1700 hrs CST on Tuesday, April 9, 2002 to: Mr. Thomas H.
