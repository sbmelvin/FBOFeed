GENERAL

A.	  Description of work:  The project consists of removing the existing Albany model 670 fabric type doors and all their associated components from both the garage entrance and exit locations, and remove from government property. Furnish and install new RYTEC “Spiral” Rigid High-Speed Roll Door (or equivalent). One door to be installed at the garage entrance and one door to be installed at the garage exit location. The “new” doors will be installed on the exterior side on the garage openings. The measurements of the existing doors are  Approx. 15’-0”wide by 10’-0” inches high.  These dimensions are to be verified in the field by the contractor.  

B.	  The contractor will need to configure the electrical wiring/controls so that only one door at each location can be operated at once. If the new door is in operation the existing interior steel roll-up door must not be able to operate, and vice versa. There is a single electrical disconnect switch that is the power source for both existing doors. (One disconnect at the entrance, and one at the exit location) Contractor is responsible to replace with a new properly sized, fused disconnect at both locations as part of this contract.  



SPECIAL CONDITIONS
 
A.	  The stucco soffit at the garage exit will need to be modified to accommodate the new door. The soffit will need to be finished in a manor that will allow full access to the door for maintenance and service. The stucco/soffit will also need to be finished in a manor that will prevent outside air from infiltrating the soffit and building interior. Contractor shall submit their soffit finish plans with sketches and/or drawings for approval by the Construction Representative.
 
B.	  The building will remain in full operation during the construction period, therefore it may be beneficial to both the contractor and the government to perform much of the work during “off-hours”.



Phase I – This phase of the work is intended to include any and all work necessary at the garage entrance.  This shall include removing existing Albany door, side rails, and associated components.  Furnish and install New  high speed roll-up door, side rails, and all necessary electrical components.  All work at garage entrance shall be 100% completed before work begins at the exit ( Phase II ) location.

Phase II – This portion of the work shall follow the same sequence of work as Phase I.  Remove existing Albany door, side rails, and associated components.  Furnish and install New  high speed roll-up door, side rails, and all necessary electrical components.Remove existing steel roll-up door and all it’s associated parts.

•	Normal “working hours” at this location are 6:00 AM through 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday.

•	The existing steel roll-up doors that are currently on the interior side shall remain in service and are not part of this project. 

•	High-speed doors to open upon vehicle approach, activated by ground/floor loop system. Door will need to be programmed to open and close in a minimum amount of time, allowing the vehicles to enter without coming to a complete stop position

•	New doors will have variable speed motor capable of operating at 65” per second. 

•	Sensing devices shall be installed to prevent any doors from closing on vehicles or pedestrian traffic with use of a reversing action.

•	All doors must be capable of being opened manually in the event of mechanical failure, or, loss of power.

•	All materials and equipment to be used as part of this work will need to be readily available so as to prevent any stoppage of work.

•	All electrical controls, disconnects, and junction boxes are to be located inside the garage area.

•	Contractor to furnish and install signage at entrance and exit locations indicating “Approaching rapid opening doors”, or words to that effect.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency, The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration & Customs Enforcement intends to negotiate a three-month extension for the period of May 1, 2006 through July 31, 2006 with the incumbent contractor, The Geo Group, a large business concern, to manage and operate the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) located at United States Naval Air Station (USNAS) Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba.  The NAICS Code is 561612 and the Size Standard is $10.5 million. The Geo Group, Inc. is presently providing services for all operational aspects of the MOC related to safety, security and accountability of the migrant population. Services provided include operation and management of the migrant population according to security and other classification considerations; intake/release procedures; maintenance of a perpetually current electronic population roster, housing and job assignments; accountability through direct observation, physical counts, development and enforcement of migrant rules and responsibilities; control of the (MOC) secure perimeter; transportation of migrants in contractor owned vehicles to programs and service on GTMO; and facilitating the delivery of programs and services by Government organizations or representatives.  The performance location is one of the most secure and remote military bases in the world. Employee recruitment is difficult due to isolation of the performance location and potential separation from family. The three-month extension is required to award a new contract with an anticipated start date of August 1, 2006. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>General Information Document Type: BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) Classification Code: A -- Research & Development Description AJ61 - Broad Area Announcement for an advanced Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV). 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as represented in FAR 6.102(d)(2). The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting proposals for advanced capabilities for a Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV). These systems enhance SOF mission performance by providing a family of mobility platforms to meet both tactical and logistical function needs.    The LTATV utility variant can be used to evacuate casualties, transport equipment, and haul supplies within the unit’s operational area.  The addition of commercially available track conversion system or other technologies may be considered to enhance around-the-clock, all weather use in cold climates and otherwise un-navigable terrain.

The USSOCOM has an interest for the research and development of a family of mobility platforms to meet tactical and logistical functions.  It is the intent of this announcement to maximize, to the greatest extent possible, technology that can be readily adapted to meet the objectives described in this BAA.   LTATVs must be designed to operate worldwide on primary and secondary roads and unimproved off-road terrain as well as mountainous terrain.  System requirements include operation in around-the-clock, worldwide use in all ranges of weather and terrain.  

The following specific aspects of the LTATV are of interest: 1) Advanced human factors consideration which enhance both safety and operational capabilities in tactical and administrative environments, including effective use of weapons and communications equipment while operating the vehicle, 2)  Optimized power plant capability with consideration of multi-fuel/hybrid electric, 3) Transportable via all current and envisioned Special Operations Forces (SOF) fixed and rotary wing cargo aircraft, including the CV-22, 4) Night vision device compatible, 5) Improved safety features such as roll-over protection, 6) Capable of supporting worldwide deployment in all terrains and climates, 7) Single and multiple-passenger variants as part of the proposed family of vehicles will be considered appropriate.

This BAA shall remain open for 30 days from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov. The Government anticipates hosting an Industry Day during May 2006.  Offeror’s interested in attending Industry Day should provide their Company Name, address, phone number and point of contact information to contract specialist, Ms. Allison Hutchens, at the following  e-mail address: hutchea@socom.mil.  Date, time and location of the Industry Day will be provided to responders to this BAA via separate correspondence.  The intent of the Industry Day is to provide the opportunity for the Government to exchange information with industry on USSOCOM’s LTATV needs and requirements and will include both open-forum and closed-door opportunities.
 
Interested parties shall provide a white paper NLT 30 days after the Industry Day.  White papers should not exceed fifteen pages of text and should describe the following:  1)  Offeror’s proposed LTATV solution and integration objective, to include discussion of vehicle size, weight, payload capability, speed, performance, sustainment support requirements, and general characteristics, 2) Proposed development approach to meet the SOF requirements, 3) Related work by the Offeror, 4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for an RDT&E effort intended not to exceed 6 months.  White papers should address any or all of the vehicle aspects noted above.  White papers will be selected for further proposal submission based on a subjective determination.  Requests for proposals (RFP) will be issued on an individual basis with responses due within 30 days.  Not all Offeror’s that provide white papers will be invited to submit a proposal.  An invitation does not assure an Offeror of a subsequent contract award.  Offerors should anticipate demonstrating the capabilities of their prototypes at a time and location to be determined by the Government.  

The selection of proposals for award will be based on a subjective determination of the proposal’s 1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed development, 2) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the development and integration, 3) Realism of the proposed costs, and 4) Performance potential of the vehicles.  Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, with respect to the availability of funds.  Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation.  

White papers and subsequent proposals must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on the offeror’s technical data.  All Offeror’s are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.

Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances. The Government may award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  Award prices will vary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents.  Proposals may be selected for award without discussions or negotiations.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to acquire Employee Assistance services for employees of NGA.  All contractor personnel shall have a Top Secret Clearance/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods. The period of performance will be from date of contract award (estimated to be March 2006) through March 2011, including options.   This acquisition will be solicitated and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.  The NGA Human Development Directorate (HD) has a requirement for Employee Assistance services to support the needs of NGA employees and their family members. NGA provides employees and family members with Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services such as counseling on relationships, stress management, balancing work/life issues, substance abuse, depression & anxiety, grief/loss counseling, chronic medical and physical problems, and parenting concerns.  Additionally, referral services are provided for child & elder care, legal and financial needs.  This requirement is a 100 % small business set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code is 624190, size standard is $6,000,000.  Proposals received from other than small business concerns will not be accepted.  The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror.

Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

<DESC>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. NASA/GSFC plans to obtain laser ranging operational support services for artificial earth satellites, and the maintenance and calibration of the McDonald Laser Ranging System (MLRS) located on McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas which is part of the NASA SLR Network. The University of Texas at Austin currently provides these services on Contract NAS5-01096 which is the latest of a succession of sole source contracts for this unique effort. These services are a continuation of the scientific and engineering mission operations support for the NASA Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) program. The services required include operations of a satellite laser tracking station and other services that include data analysis, data assurance and quality control of MLRS data products in support of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) and the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS), as appropriate. A 5-year contract is anticipated. The geometric location of MLRS is critical to the Space Geodesy Program. The exact location of the reference point at MLRS is known to about 1 centimeter of uncertainty, and was developed with over 25 years of observations contributing to the global data solution. This reference point and the Greenbelt, MD site are used together as the two fixed references for NASA's global tectonic motion data solution.  Changing either one of these two reference points would require reinitializing the global solution which was established by over 25 years of data and would require nearly a decade of additional observations to produce a global solution with the same quality as the one that exists today. The University of Texas and NASA have developed a unique satellite tracking facility at the McDonald Observatory MLRS facility, and the University of Texas has highly trained and extensively experienced staff to continue the needed uninterrupted laser tracking support at the MLRS facility.   Due primarily to the critical geometric location of the University of Texas observatory and to the importance of continuity to the SLR database, the Contracting Officer has determined that the Government’s requirement for the Satellite laser Ranging Station cannot be obtained from any other source than the University of Texas. Any other persons desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 27, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the provision of a Generic CIS (Communications Information System) Assets Buffer for ISAF (Afghanistan).

The scope of the project is to provide a temporary buffer pool of CIS equipment that will be used in support of the NATO expansion in Afghanistan. It mainly consists of workstations, laptops, printers, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), switches, telephones, fax machines, and scanners. 

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 1.0 million (USD $1.2 million). The reference of the RFQ is RFQ-CO-11946-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects:

The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Government will invite each offeror to submit fifteen (15)  bid samples and technical proposal (at no cost or obligation to the Army) for  bid samples testing (BST) and evaluation.  The Army BST will evaluate how each  candidate meets the Key Performance Parameters and Attributes of each system.   An initial basic quantity of fifty (50) M9 pistol suppressors will be  procured, to be delivered within thirty (30) days of contract award.  RFP will  be available for downloading from the following website located at  http://procnet.pica.army.mil on or about 01 February 2005.  Each offeror may  submit one or more proposals for the weapon system identified above.   The M9 pistol suppressor provides a suppressor capability that will allow the  Soldier to engage targets without being detected.  It is desired that the  flash from the suppressed weapon be equal to or less that the unsuppressed  weapon. The item is envisioned to be a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) non- developmental item (NDI).  The item must currently be in production,  developmental items are neither permitted nor desired.  The item shall not  weigh more than 8.5 ounces and shall not increase the weapon system length by  7.6 inches.  The item shall not require any tools to attach or remove it from  the weapon system.

Each suppressor shall be supplied with a heat resistant storage pouch that is  MOLLE and ALICE compatible.    The pouch shall be heat resistant up to the  maximum operating temperature of the suppressor. Each item shall have a unique identifier, UID, data matrix mark in accordance  with MIL-STD-130L The point of contact for this solicitation is David J.

<SOLNBR>W911W6-06-2-0005
<RESPDATE>042506
<ARCHDATE>06242006
<CONTACT>Elizabeth A. Jackson, (757) 878-2100
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Section I.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.2 Research & Development as described below. Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidel ines set forth herein. This Research Announcement (RA) W911W6-06-2-0005 constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION:  The Army is anticipating the development of new turboshaft engine technology for use in future manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of the Future Force. These engines will be developed under the DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engi ne (VAATE) initiative.  The Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) program will be conducted under the VAATE program and will demonstrate progress towards the VAATE phase II turboshaft/turboprop goals beginning in the FY08 timeframe. The AATE program go als will be to demonstrate a reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), an increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a reduction in development, production and maintenance cost and a design life of 6000 hrs in a turboshaft engine in a size class of interest to the Army.  In order to meet the aggressive goals of the AATE program, significant advancements in compressor technologies will be required.  The performance goals of the AATE program dictate the need for increased temperatures and pressures. Th ese conditions create significant challenges for components of the compressor in the AATE.  Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop advanced compressor technologies that possess the combination of performance and affordability necessary  to enable AATE technology level turboshaft engines to achieve their performance, cost, and life goals.  The offeror must substantiate their notional AATE configuration relevant to existing system upgrades or emerging Army platforms. The notional AATE must  also be consistent with the goals provided in this solicitation.  This program will be executed as a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) preferably that is a Cooperative Agreement pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2358. Therefore, it is the Government's desire to c onduct a technology development effort focused on advanced compressor technologies for AATE level turboshaft engines.  The period of performance for this program is approximately 43 months.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This program is focused on the development  and demonstration of the critical compressor technologies needed to help reduce the risk of the US Armys planned AATE full-engine demonstration program.  The program shall utilize a notional AATE turboshaft engine design to establish the operational requ irements and potential payoffs of the proposed concepts relative to the AATE engine performance, cost, and life goals.  The notional engine should be designed to achieve the following goals:  SFC (-25%); Hp/wt (+80%); Production Cost (-35%); Maintenance Co st (-35%); and Development Cost (-15%) at 6000 hours design life.  Notes:  (1)  SFC, Hp/wt, and production cost goal curves are available to qualified sources who have certification via DD Form 2345.  Submit request by e-mail to the contract specialist lis ted below; (2) Maintenance and development cost reductions are relative to offeror proposed baseline; (3) Free power turbine shaft engine; (4) Configuration does not include reduction gearbox, but does include inlet particle separator; and (5)  Efficient o peration at part power is desirable.  The offeror shall define the anticipated compressor design and performance characteristics consistent with their AATE design.  The offeror shall then substantiate how the selected technologies to be validated in their proposed efforts will roll-up to the performance characteristics of their engine configuration.  The offeror shall design, fabricate and perform validation test ing of the proposed compressor technologies.  Validation testing shall be conducted in an environment that simulates notional AATE operational conditions and shall be performed to validate aerodynamic, thermal, and/or mechanical performance.  The Advanced Compressor Technology program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offerors, such a plan is not required in order to  be eligible for an award under this solicitation.  DELIVERABLES:  The agreement awarded under this Solicitation will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan (delivered as part of the first bi-monthly cost and performance report); (2 ) Design Review Briefing Charts; (3) Test Plans; (4) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, and (5) Final Report.  All deliverable data may be in the format selected by the recipient.  Additionally, a final briefing at Fort Eustis, VA, shall be  presented.  Section II. Award Information:  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated period of performance is 43 months total with 40 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. The G overnment funding for the program is $1.3M distributed by fiscal year as follows: FY06/07-$250,000; FY08-$300,000; FY09-$500,000; and FY10-$250,000.  TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  Due to the commercial application of this technology, the Government anticipa tes an award of a TIA (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  It is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost  sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation of 50% are anticipated because the technology has dual-use potential and p erformers of the program will benefit from commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph  34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/32106r_041398/part34.pdf. This RA will remain open until 2:00 p.m.  Eastern Daylight time April 25, 2006. Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by August 31, 2006.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through 31  December 2006. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received.

In addition to the above Technical Proposal, a Price Proposal will be required to be submitted using the Price  Schedule and other required forms provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  A  Government Estimate will be prepared and will be used in the consideration of Price  Proposals.  Price reasonableness that matches an offeror's technical approach is  considered critical in the Government's Price Proposal consideration; however, award of a Contract will not be based solely on the lowest price proposal, significant, unexplained differences where proposed prices do not match a proposed technical approach and risk involved, may result in a Proposal being removed from the Competitive Range. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with all of the offerors within the Competitive Range. The Government also reserves the right to Award a Contract  without discussions.  All technical evaluation criteria Factors other than Price when combined are significantly more important than Price.  After the Government evaluates  the Technical and Price Proposals received, the Contracting Officer will determine a Competitive Range.  The Competitive Range will consist of all of the most highly rated Proposals against all technical evaluation criteria factors and Prices proposed. Th e Contracting  Officer may limit the number of Proposals in the Competitive Range to the greatest  number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated Proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  Plans and Specifications will be available on or about 22 March 2006.  For Technical Matters, questions must be submitted via the inter net at http://www2.mvr.usace.army.mil/Contracting/ .

Work may involve any of the above-stated disciplines and others as specifically required by the project's Statement of Work (particularly Landscape A rchitecture, Cost Engineering, and Specification Writing). Any other disciplines required will be handled on a project-by-project basis, perhaps as a consultant. 3.  SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below.  Factors are listed in descending order of importance, while subfactors are of equal importance.  Criteria a)-g) are primary factors.  Criteria h)-j) are secondary factors and will only be us ed as 'tie-breakers' among firms that are essentially technically equal.  (a) Firms must demonstrate Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the following fields (FAR 36.602-1(a)(2)): 1.General studies/designs/construction services experience. 2 . Study/design experience utilizing Architecture 3. Study/design experience utilizing Structural Engineering 4.Study/design experience utilizing Civil Engineering 5. Study/design experience utilizing Electrical Engineering 6. Study/design experience utiliz ing Mechanical Engineering 7. Experience in providing Surveying & Mapping services 8.Experience in Hydraulics & Hydrology 9.Experience in Environmental Engineering 10.Experience with Landscape Architecture 11. Experience with Cost Engineering.  (b) Profess ional Qualifications (FAR 36.602-1(a)(l)). The firm must have on its staff (or provide through a consultant[s]) registered professional engineers with demonstrated expertise in all those disciplines l isted above. The firm must also have on staff (or provide through a consultant[s]) personnel with professional engineering registration and licensed land surveyors in all six New England District states (ME, NH, VT, MA, CT, and RI). The firm must also incl ude a statement that they have the ability to obtain Professional Engineer registration and/or Land Surveyor licensure in all other NAD mission areas (NY, PA, NJ, DE, MD, VA, WV, and the District of Columbia) in a timely manner if required. Firms not demon strating these requirements will be considered unqualified.  (c) Past Performance (FAR 36.602-1(a)(4)). The firm must possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance sche dules.  (d) Capacity (FAR 36.602-1(a)(3)). The firm must have the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  (e) Firms must demonstrate previous experience in preparing construction cost estimates with the Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating S ystem (MCACES) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis methodology. The firm shall also demonstrate experience in the development of construction contingencies based upon the knowledge of Risk Analysis and level of design detail.  (f) Firms should have capability to provide all deliverables in Microstation version 7 format or later. The Government will only accept this format, without conversion or reformatting, in the target CADD software format and on the target platform specified herein. The target platform is a PC /Workstation with an Intel compatible central processing unit and a Windows 2000 operating system. Advanced software application files used for civil design and drawings shall be delivered in formats compatible with INROADS (Bentley Civil Engineering). All  delivered CADD files shall be in compliance with A/E/C CADD Standard Release 2.0.

(i) Geographic Proximity (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)). Proximity is simply the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project, and has very little to do with the technical ability of a firm to perform the project. Hence, proxi mity should normally only be used as a selection criterion for small or routine projects or IDIQ contracts in support of a specific installation(s). It will have very little bearing on this selection. (j) Volume of DoD Contract Awards (DFARS 236.602-1 (a)( 6)(A)).  DoD A-E contract awards can be obtained from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), and verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms. 4.

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form (if applicable).

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION FORMS ARE POSTED BELOW ALONG WITH THE INDUSTRY DAY(S) ANNOUNCEMENT: DE-RP52-06NA26990 -- DESIGN, INTEGRATION, CONSTRUCTION, COMMUNICATION, AND ENGINEERING (DICCE) SERVICES INDUSTRY DAY.  The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will hold an Industry Day(s) conference for the DICCE acquisition beginning on April 18, 2006.  DICCE services include installation of radiation detection and communication equipment at international land border crossings, airports and seaports.  A more detailed description of the anticipated services was included in the Sources Sought Notice published at FedBizOpps on September 6, 2005.  The conference will be designed to enhance understanding of DICCE requirements, obtain Industry feedback, provide a networking forum for all interested parties, and maximize opportunities for small business participation.  The conference will be held at 1000 Independence Avenue (Forrestal Building), SW, Washington D.C. in the Forrestal Auditorium (Room GE-086) on April 18, 2006, beginning at 9:00 a.m.  An additional session will be held on April 19, 2006, if reservations exceed the capacity of the auditorium. Participants are asked to specify their preferred date (April 18 or 19) in the event an additional session is needed.  NNSA will attempt to honor preferences on a first-come, first-served basis, and will notify participants of their reserved date, should two sessions be held.  Due to the size of the auditorium and previous expressed interest, each firm is limited to 3 attendees. Advance registration is required.  Registration forms are posted with this announcement and must be received by close of business April 10, 2006.  In view of program operational requirements, attendance is limited to domestic firms.  Each attendee must present a valid photo I.D. (i.e. drivers license) to access the Forrestal Building.  Please arrive by 8:30 a.m. to allow time for badging and security processing.  Enter the building at the main entrance which is located at the southeast corner of Independence Avenue and Lâ€™Enfant Promenade and proceed to the VIP desk, which is located to your left before the security turnstiles.  The receptionist will verify your identity, have you sign-in, and issue you a visitorâ€™s badge.  A host will guide you to the Forrestal Auditorium. The conference agenda will include briefings on the programâ€™s mission and scope; description of prior acquisitions; and DICCE requirements.  It is anticipated that the Small Business Administration (SBA) will brief Industry on topics such as teaming arrangements and size standards, and that an SBA representative will answer individual questions following the public forum. A question and answer session will be held following these presentations. Interested firms are encouraged to submit questions in writing to the Contracting Officer prior to the Industry Day(s), but no later than close of business April 13, 2006.  Question forms will be available to conference attendees as well.  All questions and their answers will be posted to both the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) and FedBizOpps following the conference.  Further information on DICCE requirements, including a draft Statement of Work, will be posted to the IIPS and FedBizOpps sites on or before March 24, 2006. Depending on the number of requests and time permitting, one-on-one meetings may be held with firms that submit a written request to the Contract Specialist no later than close of business April 7, 2006.  The one-on-one meetings are to enable individual companies or teams to ask questions and make comments/suggestions concerning the DICCE requirements and contracting strategy.  Appointments will be scheduled and time allotted based upon the number of firms responding.  Firms are encouraged to attend as a team, rather than requesting separate one-on-one meetings.  Firms requesting a session will be notified of appointment time and room location in the Forrrthrop Grumman PO Box 1693, Mailstop 5100 Baltimore MD 21203 Jeff Burns, Logistics Services Division Tele:  410-993-5125   Fax:  410-993-3905 jeff.burns@ngc.com Kevin Baxter, Chief Technologist Tele:  703-648-2442 kevin.baxter@ngc.com James Cullen, Director, Systems & Technology Tele:  703-648-2440 james.cullen@ngc.com Geary Pyles, geary.pyles@ngc.com Orbis, Inc 900 Island Park Drive, Ste 201-E Charleston SC 29492 Richard S.

Description
D--Request for Information (RFI) for Radio Frequency In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) Support Services 

SUBJECT:   Radio Frequency In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) Support Services 

DESCRIPTION: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), at the request of the United States Army Product Manager for Joint Automatic Identification Technology (PM J-AIT) and in support of National Security goals established by the President, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the identification of Sources and other information regarding Radio Frequency In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) Support Services that may be required by Product Manager, Joint Automatic Identification Technology (PM, J-AIT).  

REQUIREMENT:  The U.S. Army Product Manager, Joint-Automatic Identification Technology (PM J-AIT) is exploring the marketplace for innovative technical solutions, management and business approaches to provide reliable and cost effective global based Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology Support Services.  Information obtained from RFID devices support the US Joint Forces and coalition warfighters around the world with In-Transit Visibility (ITV) information to trace the identity, condition, status, and location of cargo from origin (depot or vendor) to destination.  Warfighters and Logisticians must have near real-time position reports for conveyances from numerous military and commercial Satellite Tracking Systems (STS).  Data from these two technology devices is combined, processed, and accessed via web-based maps and reports, on both the DOD unclassified and classified networks, in order to provide global, logistics support to the Joint war fighter.  PM J-AIT is currently receiving RF-ITV Support Services through DISA Encore 1 contract.  This potential requirement may be sourced through the Encore 2 Contract.  Therefore, contractors competing for Encore 2 contract are encouraged to respond to this RFI. 
PM J-AIT’ mission is to support the  " Joint Service and Army warfighters with information dominance by developing, acquiring, integrating, deploying and sustaining network-centric knowledge-based information technology and business management systems, communications, and infrastructure solutions through leveraged Commercial and Enterprise capabilities that support the total Army, every day and any where!"  To meet this vision PM J-AIT may acquire automatic identification technology support services by means of a performance-based contract.   Any products and services acquired for PM J-AIT’s many global customers must support the DoD transformation objectives and associated customer requirements, which due to the nature of the Global War on Terror continue to change.  PM J-AIT, through a performance based contract hopes to establish, maintain and upgrade, through the application of emerging technologies, cost effective reliable and scalable systems to support this key functional requirement.  PM J-AIT suspects that the resulting performance based system will directly tie contractor profits to the accomplishment of key performance objectives within a system infrastructure almost entirely under contractor control, from operation and maintenance of various read & write stations at global locations, to development of and operation of web-based ITV management tools for the joint warfighter.  

PM J-AIT’s possible requirement includes the following features:

·	Performance Based Services Management Contract, where performance incentives directly reflect the ability of the contractor to meet optimal performance thresholds.
·	Global Operations and Maintenance support of geographically dispersed RF-ITV technology and information systems
·	Management, Reporting, storage, and archival of data collected through the RF-ITV system
·	Increased Level of Service, offering the user a wider range of useful information through tools development and integration.
·	Centralized Infrastructure Management to facilitate contract wide performance based measures while at the same time allowing the contractor to de-centralize operations based on theater requirements. 
·	Better Value through technology insertion and continued refinement of ITV systems to drive down costs while meeting key performance objectives.

Contractor support will need to account for the following objectives:

·	Scalability and Flexibility
·	Continuous Service Improvement
·	Process Improvement
·	Management Dashboard
·	Provide performance metrics tied to PM J-AIT’s business outcomes
·	Ad-Hoc Reporting
·	Day to Day Operations and Infrastructure Maintenance Management
Operations and Maintenance
Operations and maintenance objective encompasses all IMAC, O&M, Tier 2-4 Help Desk, etc.  The current RFID tag read and write stations worldwide are listed in the chart below:

MDA/DET is conducting market research to identify Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small Businesses (SB) that have prior experience or the ability to rapidly mature and demonstrate their capability to develop, fabricate, maintain, integrate and test missile systems and instrumentation packages, and provide launch services for low fidelity ballistic missile targets to demonstrate the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) asset readiness for major tests, the cost of which typically ranges from $250,000 to $2 Million, dependent upon complexity.  Systems will support multiple customers at different ranges with varying missile configurations.  The missile/test requirement includes:
                                                                 
1)	Maximum use of excess government furnished property (GFP) rocket motors along with existing hardware such as aft skirts and fin sets and use existing mature technology to fabricate and successfully launch the test missiles. If, after analysis of requirements and considering available GFP motors and other assets, it is determined that these assets can not meet requirements, the contractor would make a recommendation for commercial motor(s) as alternative solutions. 
2)	Requested missiles will normally be flown unguided and without a flight termination system (FTS) from rail launchers at a number of different launch sites.  
3)	A number of separation planes on the mission/test article based on the number of rocket motors.
4)	Separation systems to reduce tip off rates.
5)	Possible requirements for the encryption of data.
6)	Articles in the field of regard to include the nose cone, attitude control/payload section, items ejected as payload, and spent rocket motor(s).  
7)	Attitude control/payload section with or without a spent rocket motor attached could be required to hold attitude, tumble, roll, ordnance initiation devices, etc. at prescribed mission times or altitudes.  
8)	Selected sections such as the nose cone and attitude control/payload section would usually require an instrumentation and telemetry system able to provide position, velocity, roll rate, and attitude data for collection
9)	Additional instrumentation in the form of pressure transducers, thermal couples, etc. may be required based on specific mission needs.  
                                                                 
All efforts would be closely coordinated with the government and their selected support contractors to accomplish mission objectives.

<SUBJECT>59 -- BAA SCATTERABLE MEDIA
<DESC>General Information
Document Type: BROAD AREA ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)
Classification Code:	A -- Research & Development
Description
AJ61  - Broad Agency Announcement for Air-Droppable, Scatterable Electronic Media 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting proposals for emerging technologies for air droppable, scatterable electronic media.  This media will be used to disseminate information and could take the form of long range broadcast electronic media receivers (tools, instruments, implements) for AM/FM/UHF/satellite broadcast operations, satellite radios; miniaturized AM/FM broadcast transmitters; miniaturized loudspeakers; entertainment devices; game device technologies, greeting cards; telephony technologies; text messaging; or other media capable of receiving and/or transmitting Internet broadcast or commercial radio frequency signals.  The objective of this BAA is to provide USSOCOM a capability to disseminate information.  It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new devices or facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described in this BAA.  


It is desired that such electronic media be: 1) deployable (ruggedized, robust in construction or packaging) from air-platforms, air-droppable, 2) self-powered (long-life battery, solar, friction dynamo, other), 3) lightweight, 4) trackable, 5) disguisable.  

 The following general aspects of scatterable media are of interest:  1) Miniaturization of media/transmitter/antennae/power source, 2) Ruggedized and hardened hardware, both in construction and packaging, able to withstand a variety of environmental conditions and temperatures, 3) Internet broadcast reception and transmission devices, 4) Other media applications such as Internet broadcast receivers and grouped telephones.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selection.  All are invited to submit a project proposal not exceeding 100 pages of text that describes the following:  1) The development and integration objective,  2) The development approach, 3) Related work by the investigator or proposer, 4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 6) Proposed payment milestones and program schedule, and 7) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) appended with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal submission.  Additionally, all offers must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to USSOCOM SOAL-KBA 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621 (Attn.: H92222-04-R-0032) on or before 12:00 NOON, on 25 June 2004.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.   

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed media development,  2) Demonstration of current emerging development model device, 3) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the media development and integration,  4) Relevance of the proposed media application to USSOCOM program priorities, 5) Realism of the proposed costs.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. 

The Government may award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents. Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.     

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement. 

Solicitations will be provided upon request.

<SUBJECT>--PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE ASSAULT HOSELINE SYSTEM (AHS)
<DESC>PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE ASSAULT HOSELINE SYSTEM (AHS) Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Assault Hoseline System (AHS). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider for the AHS. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; i ncreased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance  (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of AHS systems.  Operator and maintenance training, (New Equipment Training (NET)) will be the prime (Original E quipment Manufacturer (OEM)) contractors responsibility.  The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the prime contractor will be responsible for vehicle configuration, including recommendation and implementation of  configuration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintenance. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 25 years.   Goals. Desired Results and Outcomes:  Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the AHS System is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance /repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduced Logistics Footprint: "	Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization Reduced maintenance/repair times: "	Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system. Relief from conducting sustainment training: "	Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL System Candidates: Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both+ wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (Optempo) if availabl e.  See Appendix B for a profile of the AHS System.

Clearly indicate that the information is Proprietary if appropriate.  All participation is voluntary and no compensation will be provided for resp onding to this survey. The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel develo per/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, Gener al Support, and Depot maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE AHS Petroleum System:  Assault Hoseline System (AHS) Model Designators:  TBD System Description: The AHS is a mobile petroleum transport system having the mission to transfer large quantities of fuel between temporary bulk storage sites at various distances up to 2.5 miles. AHSs can be combined to span several miles between storag e points. The system is rapidly deployable and can be used over many different types of terrain and in various environments and is intended for use in rear support areas where large quantities of bulk petroleum are stored, transferred, and issued. The AHS is an integral part of the Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) for both the Quartermaster (QM) Petroleum  Pipeline  and Terminal Operating Company and the QM Petroleum Supply Company, enabling these units to perform a critical part of their mission requirement. The system consists of one 350 gallon per minute pump, an employment/retrieval device, 2.5 miles of four inch flexible hose on four reels, obstacle suspension kit, road crossing kit, spill kit, and repair kit. Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP):  1. System Description.  The AHS consists of 14,000 feet of 4-inch collapsible conduit, a 350-gallon per minute (GPM) engine driven pumping assembly, and various support kits required to emplace, recover, and operate the system.  This version of the AHS wil l include a deployment/retrieval capability that was not part of previous systems.  The collapsible hoses will be stored and deployed from a powered reel system.  This capability allows the system to be emplaced and recovered using less personnel and equip ment than the previous flaking box system.  The AHS provides bulk petroleum handling units the ability to move bulk fuel to/from storage locations that may not be accessible by vehicle, rail, or air.  The AHS can be connected to a fixed or tactical pipelin e, used to move fuel from a rail head to the tactical storage site, used to move fuel away from an airhead, or transfer fuel from the main road to the bulk storage site. 2. Wartime OMS/MP.  After mission identification, the employing unit emplaces the AHS following the general steps below: "	Choose an emplacement route.  Select a direct route that is free of obstacles.  If possible, try to parallel an existing road to aid construction and speed deployment.  "	Determine the deployment trace distance and any elevation changes.  Determine the location of the pumping assembly by hydraulic analysis. "	Load the conduit deployment/recovery system onto the deployment vehicle.  Proceed to the start point. "	Secure the end of the conduit to a vehicle or other appropriate anchor. "	Begin deploying  the conduit in accordance with the deployment/recovery operating instructions. "	After deployment of the conduit, emplace the pumping assembly.   "	Connect the suction and discharge hoses to the pumping assembly.  "	Connect the AHS conduit to the receipt storage tank. "	Once everything is connected, fill the line with fuel and gradually increase the line pressure until you reach the desired operating point. Transferring Bulk Fuel After the AHS is setup and performing the bulk fuel transfer mission, the system may be required to operate for up to 20 hours per day continuously.  Other operations require fewer operating hours per day, but more start and stop cycles.  When being used t o transfer fuel from tankers, rail cars, or aircraft, system operation will be cyclic.  Pumping time will be long enough to empty the supplying vessels.  At the completion of pumping, the system is shutdown, disconnected from the supply source.  Full suppl y tanks are positioned and the AHS reconnected and transfer operations resumed.  This process is repeated up to 10-15 times a day, resulting in an operating time of 10-hours per 20-hour operational day.  System Recovery After completion of the bulk fuel transfer mission at a specific location, the AHS is evacuated, recovered, and redeployed at a new location.  Recovery and redeployment occurs once every 20 days.   3.  Environmental Conditions.  The environmental conditions in which the MMFF will operate are shown below in Table 3. Climate Types	Usage Hot	30% Basic	70% Table 1 4. Movement Terrain.  The AHS can be deployed over any terrain that the deploying vehicle can traverse.  The primary deployment vehicle for the AHS is the 5-ton cargo truck.  In addition to the 5-ton cargo truck, the AHS can be deployed by the HEMTT-LHS an d PLS when mounted on a flatrack.  The AHS shall be capable of deployment over the   following deployment terrain profile. Terrain	Usage                Primary Roads	20%                Secondary Roads	50%                Trail	15%                Cross Country	15% Table 2 OEM: LaBarge Products, Inc., ST. Louis, MO. Availability of TDP: The Army does not own a TDP, the system was procured according to PD# ATPD 2268, Dated 30 Oct 02.  Configuration Stability: System configuration is currently frozen pending results of Production Qualification Test. Fleet Assessment: The AHS is a new system currently in Full Rate Production (FRP). The initial quantities to be delivered are 34 systems in 2006 with anticipated quantity of 74 systems fielded thru 2011. G8 still owes us a distribution plan however they ha ve indicated that the first units to be equipped are the Units of Action.  Useful Life of the AHS is 20 years. Annual Support Workload (Maintenance AMMS): Direct productive annual maintenance man-hours requirement by MOS for each level of maintenance to be performed by the gaining MACOM, are as follows: OCC-SPEC	UL	DS	GS 63B	91.4          15.7         0 63J                     200          150          200  Reliability  Mean Hours Between Essential Function Failure (MHBEFF): AHS Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) estimates the 350 gpm pump will require 200 hrs MHBEFF and the ERS will require 50 cycles MHBEFF. Depot Capability  Current Workload: None, system is currently in LRIP. Annual Sustainment Parts Cost: Life Cycle Cost Estimate states $34,800 per system for annual replenishment of spare replacements and consumables. Current Organic Support:   1.  Supply and Logistics Support: Support objectives for initial operational capability will be full organic support.  Interim contractor support for supply will be considered to expedite initial provisioning, if required.  Integrated prognostics/diagnosti cs will be used to the maximum extent possible to reduce the maintenance burden based on operational concept and total life cycle cost. Supply support requirements will be generated from a detailed analysis of maintenance tasks that will identify all resources required for system support.  Provisioning Technical Documentation will be used for the identification, selection, determination of initial requirements, and cataloging of support items to be procured thro ugh the provisioning process.  The Logistics Support contractor will be required to develop a Supply Support Summary using data elements as specified in LMI data product worksheets.  The AHS IPT will review and approve the Spare Parts List and the Interim Support Items List.  The Provisioning Data will permit NSN assignment, as required, and the procurement and stockage of high-demand items. Initial spares (Authorized Stockage List [ASL] and Prescribed Load List [PLL]) will be provided to gaining units and funded by PM PAWS.  Replenishment spares will be stocked according to demand, funded and requisitioned by the using activity. 2.  Maintenance Concepts:  This procurement will utilize organic logistical support for the maintenance and servicing of the AHS and will conform to the requirements and guidance IAW AR 750-1 (Army Materiel Maintenance Policy) and DA PAM 738-750 (Functiona l Users Manual for The Army Maintenance Management System [TAMMS]). Maintenance will correspond to the Two-Level Maintenance System concept (Field and Sustainment).  Field includes operator preventative maintenance (C), unit maintenance (O) and some direct support maintenance (F).  Sustainment will also include some direct  support maintenance as well as all general support maintenance (H).  Field and Sustainment maintenance will be preformed using standard tools, test, measurement and diagnostic equipment.  No depot support is envisioned for the AHS.  A Preventative Mainten ance Checks and Services (PMCS) and a Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) will be included in the system technical manual. The AHS will have a probability of completion of 1 day of retail and bulk fuel distribution operations as described in the operational mode summary/mission profile without the occurrence of an essential function failure (EFF) of at least R(EFF) = 0.80.  Th e median time to repair (MedTTR) for all essential unscheduled maintenance demands (EUMD) will not exceed 1 hour.  The maximum time to repair for 90 percent of all EUMD (MAXTTR 90) will not exceed 2.5 hours.  3. Training and Training Devices:  The Materiel Developer will provide a complete training package that will support all phases of training for the AHS.  The Training Support Package (TSP) will be developed to support New Equipment (NET), Institutional and  Sustainment Training.  The system TSP will be designed and developed IAW U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Regulation 350-70 within the Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) database and will be concurrently developed with the syste m and delivered in draft to U.S. Army CASCOM, Training Directorate, System Integration Division, for review and approval.  The AHS System TSP will include electronic technical manuals (ETM), program of instruction, lesson plans, student and instructor guid es and an instructional DTV (Distributive Training Vehicle) Web-based interactive multimedia package on the operation and maintenance of the AHS.  The DTV will be provided for use in sustainment training and to facilitate distance learning.  An embedded tr aining capability will be considered.  Instructor and key personnel training (I&KPT) will be provided for the initial transfer of information and training methods from the materiel developer to the trainer.  Distance learning will also be considered as a m ethod of providing NET. The AHS will be provided to the Quartermaster and Ordnance Maintenance Mechanical Schools for use in institutional training.

 Acceptance and Inspection Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.  They will involve a total of 2 samples: one will be run to evaluate SPR spectroscopy and SPR imaging, the other will be run to evaluate SPR fluorescence spectroscopy and SPR fluorescence microscopy.  For each sample, the signal stability will be evaluated for 1 hour before adding the analyte, 1 hour after the adsorption reaches steady state, and 1 hour after rinsing back to pure buffer. 
3. The item must operate in 4 measurement modes: 1) SPR spectroscopy, 2) SPR imaging, 3) SPR fluorescence spectroscopy, 4) SPR fluorescence microscopy.  Modes 1) and 3) can be performed by integrating the total or partial image signal obtained from 2) and 4).  

1) SPR Spectroscopy:
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) reflectivity measurements are surface-sensitive, spectroscopic methods that can be used to characterize the thickness and/or index of refraction of ultrathin organic and biopolymer films at noble metal (Au, Ag, Cu) surfaces.  SPR spectroscopy can be characterized by three primary capabilities: (i) with SPR spectroscopy the kinetics of adsorption for organic molecules, biomolecules, or colloidal particles can be measured in real time, (ii) the adsorption of unlabeled analyte (no fluorescent or radiological tags) to the surface can be monitored, and (iii) SPR has a high degree of surface sensitivity that allows weakly bound interactions to be monitored in the presence of excess solution species (ability to perform classic Langmuir isotherm experiments).  Using samples we provide, the contractor should also be able to demonstrate (i) a noise floor of 0.54 microRIU = 0.40 RU = 0.000040 deg. (Raw Data RMS      Noise = 1.2 microRIU = 0.85 RU = 0.000085 deg), and (ii) baseline stability with a maximum drift of 5 microRIU/hour [1 microRIU = 0.73 RU = 0.000073 Deg] (iii) a maximum time resolution of at least 2 data points per second.

2) SPR Imaging:
SPR imaging is based on the same technical concept as SPR spectroscopy except the photodetector is replaced with a CCD camera.  The amount of adsorption is therefore measured as a function of position in two dimensions, allowing one to look at patterned substrates, or heterogeneous surfaces.  An important component of SPR imaging is the ability to convert the data, which is archived as a movie, into SPR spectroscopy plots by plotting the integrated signal from a user-selected area of the image as a function of time.
		
3) SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy:
In contrast to SPR spectroscopy, SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy does not measure the intensity of the light reflected from the back of the noble metal film.  Instead, the evanescent light wave that passes through the reflecting film is used to excite fluorescence from either quantum dots or fluorescent molecules in close proximity to the film.  The camera is therefore placed above the sample (same side as aqueous solution) rather than behind it.  The number of photons are then counted so that binding to the surface is monitored in terms of fluorescence intensity.  Once it is demonstrated that the CCD camera has an absolute proportionality between image signal and intensity, the total signal can then be calibrated with the SPR spectroscopy data, which is obtained simultaneously as described in 1), to measure the amount (thickness or mass) of the fluorescently-labeled material that has adsorbed to the surface.  The maximum time resolution should be at least 1 data point per second in order to monitor the kinetics of binding for both fluorescently-labeled and unlabeled material.

	4) SPR-Assisted Fluorescence Microscopy:
Except for the direction of the incoming light, the technique is very similar to conventional fluorescence microscopy.  It allows one to capture micrographs of the fluorescently-labeled material that is in close proximity to the noble metal film.  One can also capture movies with the CCD camera and convert the data into SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy plots by plotting the integrated signal from a user-selected area of the image as a function of time.  In principle, one could inspect patterned surfaces or surfaces with chemistry gradients and collect SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy plots from any part of the image.  This data is then compared with the SPR imaging signal to calibrate the data and to compare the kinetics of adsorption of fluorescently-labeled material with that of the unlabeled material.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

”Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
