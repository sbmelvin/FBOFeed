Promotion of democratic governance which is critical to successful development and calls for increased attention to democratic governance in programming across all sectors.  Fragile States which is  focusing on  developing assistance strategies to generate positive impacts in fragile states.  Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is newly established and will provide substantial funding to selected countries that meet a variety of development indicators.    Increased focus on governance dimensions, due to MCA-related incentives, may create new opportunities for technical assistance in support of democratic governance.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Core Fluorescence Imaging Facility (CFIF) within the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression (LRBGE) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Applied Precision LLC, 1040 12th Avenue NW, Issaquah, WA 98027for a Delta Vision RT Upgrade kit for its existing Delta Vision imaging System. The CFIF provides expert scientific consultations on the advantages and limitations of the different forms of microscopy and helps develop a comprehensive microscopy research strategy. The Facility assists in the design of experiments, and helps to solve specific experimental problems associated with the microscopy. Specifically, the CFIF provides equipment and expertise for multi-color high-resolution 2D, 3D and 4D image acquisitions on confocal and wide-field microscopes.  Special expertise is provided on FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer), live imaging and image processing by deconvolution.  This procurement is an upgrade of CFIF’s existing deconvolution Delta Vision imaging system, which is based on Olympus inverted IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with an automatically controlled stage that allows precise movement in XYZ directions and allows imaging of several fields of view in the same time-lapse sequence. The upgrade includes support of these cameras:  MicroMax, CH350 and CoolSnap HQ.  Data collection is controlled by SoftWoRx software installed on a  Linux Red Hat workstation. Images are collected by a sensitive 12-bit camera (Photometrics). Images obtained on other imaging systems may be deconvolved by the SoftWoRx program. Deconvolution microscopy computationally reduces out-of-focus light.  Applied Precision holds the patents on the software and Precision Stage and is the only known source for this upgrade of the Government owned Delta Vision system.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The Governments intent is to upgrade one of its instruments, and capability statements offering a new instrument will not be considered.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on November 3, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516; Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>1.  Navair Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to develop Generic Reconfigurable PC Based Training System (GRTS) applications for the Naval 
Surface training community.   GRTS applications are software programs that operate in an Automated Electronic Classroom (AEC) environment with networked PCs running under the Microsoft Windows Operating System.  The training system software will be developed for multiple naval surface training applications including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Combat Information Center (CIC) training, propulsion, engineering damage control, Tactical Data Links, and other naval surface training applications.  The training application layer of software will make use of a Computer Off the Shelf (COTS) software simulation environment generation engine which also serves as the instructor station controller. All software must be compatible with existing GRTS software and built to the existing software documentation.  Additional tasks under this Multiple Award Contract will include Training Situation Analysis, Software Design, and Software Integration of other 3rd party software applications.  Future GRTS applications may be required to function within the Navy’s Integrated Learning Environment, (ILE) and operate with Intelligent Tutoring and Computer Based Training applications.  Distributed Interactive Simulations (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) compliance may also be required under this contract.  Attached in this posting is a sample Statement of Work (SOW) for one of the trainers and it is for informational purposes only.  The COTS product currently being used is the Northrop Grumman Combined Tactical Trainer and Analysis System (CTTAS).  Navair Orlando is interested in hearing about any other COTS products, similar to CTTAS, which have been developed and may be used interchangeably or modified to work with CTTAS and existing GRTS applications.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY: TACOM invites your response to the below market survey questionnaire for procuring M1000 Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) semi trailer RESET services. RESET is described as: The level of effort to meet the Army requirement to return the force to fully rea dy status, 10/20 standards within a specific timeframe.     This market survey questionnaire represents the intention of the U.S. Army to solicit information from potential suppliers regarding their capability to meet our technical, cost, and schedule requirements for the Armys upcoming RESET effort.  This RESET e ffort involves returning all battle worn or damaged M1000s to a like new condition (zero miles/zero hours) IAW the M1000 performance description, without adversely impacting the existing logistics/support system.  In addition, a maximum timeframe of 120 p roduction (calendar) days is essential to maintain readiness for worldwide deployment requirements.  Intent: It is the intent of TACOM, on behalf of the Army, to award a four year Requirements contract.  The M1000 semi trailers are fielded to Active, U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard units.   Description of System: The M1000 Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) semi trailer carries a variety of payloads, ranging from ISO containers to armored vehicles and other heavy equipment   a 70 ton nominal load, including the Abrams Main Battle Tank (M1 Seri es),  It is equipped with five axle lines with two half-width axles per line.  Each axle can oscillate laterally to accommodate crowned roads and rough terrain.  Axles 2, 3, 4 and 5 automatically steer to proper Ackerman geometry based on normal tractor mo vement. The deck is adjustable (+/- 10 inches from normal operating height) to accommodate loading/unloading. The gooseneck, suspension, and steering systems operate off a hydraulic system. Diesel or JP-8 auxiliary power is provided to operate the goosenec k, steering, and deck controls independent of a prime mover.  The brakes are operated through a two-line straight air supply from the Prime Mover with five tanks on the vehicle.  Each axle is equipped with spring actuated park/emergency features.  A pivoti ng, hydraulically supported gooseneck equalizes the 5th wheel load and provides flexibility over rough terrain. Schedule: The intent is to award a contract in FY 05 to acquire approximately 222 each RESET M1000 semi trailers.  Subsequent year production will be based on available funding and is not guaranteed.  Delivery of the first units will be approximately three  months after contract award.  RESET samples will then be tested by an on-site QAR to determine if they meet the performance specifications.  Contractor test costs may include transportation of equipment and furnishing onsite personnel to support the test.

<DESC>Market Survey for the Afghanistan Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (AFMTV) Program General Information Document Type:  		Sources Sought Notice Solicitation Number:  		W56HZV-05-R0074 Posted Date:			22 Oct 04 Response Date:                  08 Nov 04		 Set-Aside:			N/A Contracting Office Address:  TACOM-Warren, ATTN:  AMSTA-AQ-ADB, E Eleven Mile Road, Warren, MI 48397-5000 Description This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.     The U.S. Army Tank-automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of low-tech, medium tactical vehicles, comprised of four (4) variants (description of each is attached), which will supply the Afghan Nati onal Army (ANA).  There is also a small requirement for 4 vans (maintenance and hazardous material vans) which are also a part of this requirement.   There are four threshold requirements: 1.) Vehicles must operate with diesel fuel. 2.) Maximum commonality between the main four variants. 3.) Ease of maintenance with little to no computer technology embedded in the vehicles, are desired.  4.) Durability for rough, mountainous terrain and climate of the country of Afghanistan are crucial factors that will be considered as part of the selection process.  In addition, delivery of 40 General Transport, 24 POL, 16 Water, and 20 Ambulance Medium tactical vehicles starting in July 2005 to country is highly desired.  A five-year, firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type-contract will be issued.  Shipping terms will be Free-on-Board: Origin.  One contract award will be made (ALL OR NONE).  The Afghan Government is estimating the target award unit price to be approximately $100,000 to $110,000.  Operators manuals will need to be provide d in English as well as a simplified Operators manual translated into the language of Dari (Afghan Persian). The purpose of the survey is to assist in determining what commercial vehicles are available immediately which meet our needs, and possibly what Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) are currently available or could be available in the July 2005 timeframe.  For p lanning purposes, release of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is targeted for the December 2004 to January 2005 timeframe; with award of a contract in the March to April 2005 timeframe. [As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a commercial item is (1) Any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, an d--(1) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or, (2) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public; (2) Any item that evolved from an item described in paragraph (1) of this definition through advances in technology  or performance and that is not yet available in the commercial marketplace, but will be available in the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the delivery requirements under a Government solicitation; (3) Any item that would satisfy a criterion expre ssed in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this definition, but for (i) Modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace; or (ii) Minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Go vernment requirements. Minor modifications mean modifications that do not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process. Factors to be considered in determ ining whether a modification is minor include the value and size of the modification and the comparative value and size of the final product. Dollar values and percentages may be used as guidep osts, but are not conclusive evidence that a modification is minor. FAR defines a non-developmental item as follows:   a.   any previously developed item used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the U.S. has a mutual defense cooperation agreement.   b.   Any item described in paragraph a., above, that requires only minor modification to meet the requirements of the procuring agency.   c.   Any item currently being produced that does not meet the requirement of paragraphs a or b, above, so lely because the item is not yet in use.]   Your responses will assist in finalizing plans for this effort and allow better definition of requirements, thereby providing a more clearly written solicitation to industry.   The government will not reimburse contractors for any costs incurred as a resul t of their participation in this survey.   ** Submit survey documentation by email AS WELL AS a printed hard copy no later than November 8, 2004, 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time, to: rybicksc@tacom.army.mil taborr@tacom.army.mil	                 AND * Material Acquisition Group, ATTN:  AMSTA-AQ-ADB, Mr. Scott Rybicki, MS 326, 6501 E. 11 Mile Road, Warren, MI 48397-5000,  All survey documentation must be in English.

General The Afghan National Army has the constitutional task to defend the territorial integrity of Afghanistan.  To fulfill this task, the ANA must be able to conduct stationary and mobile operations, including logistically sustaining itself in the field.  A prer equisite for operations is strategic, operational and tactical mobility, i.e., the capability to move troops, equipment and supplies into and out of, as well as in the area of operations.  There is no railroad system in Afghanistan, so ground mobility has to be secured by road and off-road transport.  The required degree of mobility should be achieved by designing a mix of light, medium and heavy general and specialized transport assets.  Where applicable, these assets can be augmented by contracted transpo rt and air transport assets.  In order to achieve the highest possible efficiency, families of vehicles using common design characteristics (chassis, drive train, engine, gearbox) should be used/purchased whenever possible.  The vehicles must be able to ac complish the mission under the Afghan conditions (austere road conditions, lack of traffic infrastructure, extreme climatic and geographical conditions).  The following paragraphs lay out the requirements for the product family of medium trucks. 2. Overall Requirements The Medium Truck Family of the Afghan Army should fulfill the following overall requirements: * All Terrain Capability (Mandatory: austere road conditions, dry riverbeds, deserts, high mountains), * Capable to operate in extreme heat and cold (Mandatory: climatic temperature Range in Afghanistan +50 degrees Celsius to -50 degrees Celsius), * Diesel Engine (Mandatory, only fuel available), * All Wheel Drive with differential locks, gear reduction desirable, * Manual gearshift preferred; * Heavy duty suspension, * Drive train, engine, chassis common to all variants, * Range Greater than 500km on roads, Greater than 300km in off-road terrain, * trailer package, tow capacity up to 5000 kg * 24V-plug, communications mountings (Mandatory: communications equipment), NATO adapter; * winch on 50 % of the vehicles; * Weapons brackets for personal weapons in the vehicle cabin; * Central tire pressure control system (Note: desired); * Run-Flat Tires (required if central tire inflation is not available) * High reliability, * Robust simple design, easily maintainable, * Low procurement and Maintenance Costs, * One -year full maintenance package in Afghanistan * Training for Afghan Army military maintenance personnel;  * Documentation required (Operator manual in Dari and Maintenance Manuals) * BII with each vehicle  3.

<SUBJECT>D -- CONTINUED SUPPORT OF AN AUTOMATED EXPORT SERVICE
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, The U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Flagship Customs Services (FCS), located in Silver Spring, Maryland, for the continued support of an Automated Export System hereinafter referred to as AESDirect.  The AESDirect is a US government Internet-based service operated by the Foreign Trade Division of the USCB.  Since September 1999 this service has been provided by FCS. AESDirect is designed to provide a convenient internet-based electronic filing service that allows authorized parties to electronically file their Shipper Export Declarations (SEDs). AESDirect offers a broad based selection of filing options ranging from Interactive Web-based entry of data, for lower volume filers, to a fully automated Virtual Private Network (VPN) data exchange for large volume filers. FCS developed the AESDirect and has operated, supported, and maintained the system since1999.  FCS is responsible for ALL aspects of the AESDirect Service including: Software/Service specification, development, testing, deployment and maintenance; Data center facility provision, management and operation; Telecommunications installation, configuration and operation; Technical support; Client account registration and amendment; Customer support; Overall service performance and quality assurance.  In addition FCS operates two mirrored data centers to support and run the AESDirect Service.  These data centers consist of a primary production data center and a mirrored disaster recovery data center. For all of these activities FCS has worked closely with the FTD and where appropriate with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ensure the on-going success of the AESDirect Service. The outstanding success of these working relationships is one of the key elements to the on-going success of AESDirect. The period of performance for this requirement will be for a base period of one year with the option to extend for four (4) 1 year periods.  It is the Government’s belief that only Flagship Customs Service can satisfy the BOC’s requirement. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received within the required time will be reviewed and evaluated.  Interested companies having the capability to provide the above described services should submit, in writing, their capability statement with cost information to the above address, Attn.: Gloria Smith, email to gloria.i.smith@census.gov, or fax @ (301) 457-1785 within 15 days of this notice. No telephone requests will be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days from the date of this notice, a sole source contract with Flagship Customs Service will be pursued without further notice.

<DESC>The U S Environmental Protection Agency [U S EPA], National Environmental Research Laboratory in Las Vegas, Nevada, intends to award a fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR] Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items and FAR 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.  The Government will award a Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the lowest priced/technically acceptable.  The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire on-site [Research Triangle Park, North Carolina]training in ENVI software for hyperspectral image processing and analysis emphasizing landcover, vegetation and water quality analysis applications. A training classroom, Windows operating system computers and LCD projection system will be provided by the EPA.   Training must provide the following:     
1.       Class size will be between six [6] and twelve [12] students.
2.       Training will last five [5] consecutive days and is to be conducted at the EPA facility in RTP subsequent to the award date and prior to March 31, 2005.  Proposals should include a minimum of three [3] possible dates.
3. 	Training will focus on advanced processing of airborne/spaceborne earth-looking hyperspectral (imaging spectroscopy) remote sensing data (approximately four [4] days). Trainers may assume the students have professional experience with remote sensing, and at least a cursory knowledge of imaging spectroscopy/hyperspectral imaging theory. EPA will provide raw and atmospherically corrected AVIRIS data for use in training exercises (see New Bern quicklooks at http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/ql/list99.html). In addition to the imagery data, EPA has approximately 29 field reference sites located within the AVIRIS flight line that include both vegetation characterization measurement data and field images (digital camera). These data may be accessed at http://www.epa.gov/nerlesd1/land-sci/lcb/nrb/VFRDB/. EPA will also provide Hyperion data for scenes in the Albemarle-Pamlico Drainage Basin of North Carolina/Virginia for use in training exercises.
4. 	Training will provide an overview of ENVI functionality and interface for experienced remote sensing scientists who may be unfamiliar with the ENVI software (approximately one half [1/2] day).
6. 	Trainers will provide detailed course materials and syllabus at least one (1) month prior to the training class.

Vendor must include a class syllabus detailing all lecture topics and the specific exercises to be covered in the requisite five days. Price must be broken down to show travel costs separate from actual course costs. Vendor must supply Federal Tax Identification number, Dun and Bradstreet number, and Central Contractor Registration to be eligible for award.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 611420. Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA/s requirement stated herein may submit a response, which if received by November 24, 2004, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. The estimated magnitude of this procurement is less than $25,000. All questions should be directed to Cheryl O’Donnell via email at odonnell.cheryl@epa.gov

<DESC>The Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration is the primary road-builder for the National Park Service, Forest Service, Wildlife Refuges, and several other government agencies.  The roads constructed or rehabilitated by Federal Lands are generally low to medium volume roads.  

Guidelines need to be developed that document the warrants for barrier use, provide guidance for the selection of the types of barrier that are safe and appropriate for the project-specific environment, and provide guidance on placement criteria.  Additionally, an information packet with photos, charts, descriptions, etc. is needed to guide and demonstrate Federal Lands’ decision-making process for selecting barrier types.  The barrier warrants will show consideration for speed, volume, types of hazards, geometric issues, pedestrian safety, environmental concerns (including terrain, weather conditions, and wildlife issues), performance, and costs.  

The Contractor shall supply all personnel, equipment, materials, hardware and software to perform a literature review, develop a Barrier Guide that will include guidance on barrier warrants, selection, and placement criteria, produce a CD-ROM presentation that briefly summarizes the various barrier, terminal and transition types and selection process, and produce a training package to assist in implementation of the use of the Barrier Guide.  The Contractor shall meet and cooperate with the FHWA CFLHD in Lakewood, Colorado.  The Contractor’s services will be required for a period not to exceed 14 consecutive months
 
The work required for the development of this barrier guide will be awarded as one contract.  For a complete SOW that includes deliverables, period of performance, pricing, and evaluation factors, visit our web site at http://www.cflhd.gov/.  Click on the Procurement Tab, Current Solicitations, Solicitations-Other.  The web sites provided in this announcement must be entered manually-a direct link is not operative. 

 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

STATEMENT OF WORK
MILITARY PAY OPERATIONS
EMAIL MARKETING

BACKGROUND:  Because Military Pay Operations is committed to educating the customer on their pay, DFAS is seeking to use email marketing to keep customers up to date on pay specific issues.  DFAS is in search of an electronic mail service vendor who provides web-based software that will enable DFAS to send permission-based emails to DFAS's subscribers.  The email marketing tool should enable DFAS to accomplish the following 3 main objectives:  (1) educate the customer through the use of email bulletins and periodic newsletters, (2) track and measure the customer's use of the email newsletters and bulletins, (3) follow up on customer responses both in automated and manual form. This online account, hosted by the vendor, will store DFAS specific information such as newsletter articles, pictures, surveys, email address lists, and tracking results. 
SCOPE: The vendor will be required to maintain DFAS's account on their server, and provide access to authorized users to support the creation, delivery and tracking of email marketing efforts.  Within the first year of acquiring the vendor's services, DFAS will target solely Army customers for the receipt of email newsletters and bulletins. We project to reach roughly 286,000 subscriber.  During the second year of the initiative, we will expect to have 523,000 subscribers.  In the third year, we expect to reach roughly 822,000 subscribers.  DFAS plans to send out batch emails to all subscribers approximately 6 times per year.  For example, in the first year, DFAS will send approximately 286,000 emails 6 times per year totaling 1,716,000 emails sent in that year.
OBJECTIVES:  DFAS is seeking a vendor who can provide a web-based software that will enable DFAS to send permission-based emails, as well as store all data relating to email marketing efforts on the vendor's server.  The data stored will include email addresses, profile information (name, rank, email address, etc.), templates, emails, and historical tracking information.  All data will be accessible by authorized DFAS users, and permissions will include adding, deleting, modifying and retrieving data at any point in time.  Other services required in connection with the storage of data will be described in detail in the requirements section of this document. The email marketing tool, along with the stored information, will be used to provide DFAS's customer up to date pay information.
REQUIREMENTS:  The vendor will provide access and use of their web-based email marketing tool to authorized DFAS users.  Features of email marketing tool shall include:
4.1 Collection and storing of customer names and email addresses.
4.1.1    The vendor shall provide DFAS with HTML code that will enable customer information to be populated into the vendor's system. 
4.1.2 The vendor's web interface shall allow DFAS users to manually input, edit, delete, and organize any and all customer profile information.  Examples of profile information include customer name, email address, rank, service, etc. 
4.1.3 Within the profile information, the vendor's system shall display the status of each email address.  The purpose of this is to keep DFAS informed of those customers who have valid, undeliverable, and unsubscribed email addresses.
4.2 Uploading, categorizing, storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting data using the web interface.  Examples of data include text, pictures, surveys, .pdf files, etc.
4.2.1  The application shall allow for administrative rights amongst chosen authorized users, which will grant all privileges to specified users.  
4.3  Creating, editing, viewing and storing of templates for emails, bulletins and surveys.

4.4.1 DFAS shall have the option to create emails from existing templates, from HTML, and from revising existing emails.
4.4.2 Email subject line shall be able to be personalized with user profile information.  An example of this would read: "Mr. Smith, here is your June Military Pay Newsletter"

4.6 Delivering newsletters and bulletins to subscribing customers.
4.6.1 Vendor's email marketing tool shall utilize personal profile information when delivering email newsletters and bulletins.  Vendor's email marketing tool shall recognize the profile attributes for each customer and send the appropriate content (articles, pictures, surveys, etc.) that corresponds with those unique attributes.  For example:  A customer in the Army would only receive Army related articles, pictures, etc., whereas a customer in the Navy would receive Navy specific information.

PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
