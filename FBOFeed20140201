<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for proposals. A publically available solicitation document is not available at this time, and will not be issued&nbsp;with proposals requested, pending responses to this Notice and a determination to seek full and open competition.
<p><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions - Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) Research and Development Contracts Management Branch (R&amp;D CMB), on behalf of the NIMH, intends to negotiate a modification to an existing contract with Research Triangle Institute, PO Box 12194, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, Contract no. HHSN-271-2008-00037-C entitled, "NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program (CSDSP)", on a sole source basis pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p>This initiative is part of the Molecular, Cellular, and Genomic Neuroscience Research Branch (MCGNRB), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The mission of the MCGNRB is to support fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying and influencing brain development, neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity, signal transduction pathways, and the biochemical and behavioral actions of therapeutic agents in animals and humans. The goals of the MCGNRB include the identification of novel targets (genes or molecules) for therapeutic intervention, characterization of the neurobiological behavioral actions of psychoactive agents, and design and development of novel ligands for functional brain imaging in humans, psychoactive agents for basic and clinical research, and potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of mental disorders.</p>
<p>The current contract for the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program (CSDSP) was competitively awarded to Research Triangle Institute under Contract HHSN-271-2008-00037-C on 09/27/2008, as a cost-reimbursement research and development type contract, which currently expires on February 26, 2014. Under this contract, Research Triangle Institute stores and maintains the CSDSP inventory of approximately 490 compounds, has processed hundreds of requests for compounds, including packaging and shipment of compounds, and has conducted over 70 synthetic chemistry projects to add new compounds to the inventory.</p>
<p>Without this brief extension period, the Government would be required to move all Government property, prior to contract expiration, to a yet-to-be identified NIH supported facility, which would be costly and would interrupt essential research services.</p>
<p>Research Triangle Institute is uniquely qualified to perform this work since they currently house the NIMH compound inventory, including radioactive compounds -&nbsp;a resource that cannot be moved without significant time and effort.&nbsp;A new Contractor would not be able to receive the inventory from RTI, start-up&nbsp;and continue the resource&nbsp;during this brief extension period,&nbsp;without&nbsp; interruption to research services and with&nbsp;the same level of efficiency that RTI has established at this late stage of completion of the project. Under the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 253[c](1) and FAR 6.302-1, RTI is the only source capable of meeting the Government's requirements during this brief contract extension.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span><br /><br />The purpose of this contract modification is to continue <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> the maintenance and distribution of the Government-owned compound inventory for an additional three (3) months on a noncompetitive basis in order to allow continuing services during the re-competition of this program.
