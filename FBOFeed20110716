<DESC>The United State Government intends to award a lease extension using other than full and open competition for an existing lease for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement that is expiring in San Diego, CA at 185 West F Street.
<p>The Government requires 32,029 rentable square feet of space. The space must be located in downtown San Diego, be contiguous, and 52 structured parking spaces must be included.</p>
<p>The requirement is needed beginning January 1, 2013 when the current lease expires. The agency will be relocating to the renovated Federal Building at 880 Front Street as early as January 1, 2014 and no later than December 31, 2015. As such, the requirement is for three (3) years total, one (1) year firm term and two (2) years soft term (cancellable with notice).</p>
<p>The Government will only consider alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.</p>
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST: Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership. If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM Pacific time, July 22, 2011. Expressions of interest should include building name and address, legal description, 1/8-inch scale drawing of space offered, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), method of measurement used to determine rentable square feet (Common Area Factor), and contact information for owner or authorized agent.</p>
