While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

This notice is being posted to comply with FAR 5.101 & 8.402(f) The open market items are being procured under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Monaco Enterprises, 14820 East Sprague Avenue, Spokane Valley, WA 99216.  This purchase will be made under simplified acquisition procedures - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirement.   <br> The 188th ANG FW Ft. Smith, Arkansas requires their existing fire alarm base station upgraded. The current system is no longer produced and repair parts are no longer available.  The open market requirement includes Monaco's D-21:Base 14-U Rack, Server, P/N 227-010-04(2); Uninterruptible Power Supply, P/N 404-114-01 (2); and ancillary travel charges for technicians to provide installation.  The current base wide system is Monaco and all buildings on base contain Monaco fire alarm systems. The subject acquisition will replace the existing Monaco base system that is out of production with the current version of Monaco's base system.  Monaco is the only source being considered to ensure interoperability between existing Monaco fire alarms in all base buildings and the central reporting/receiving system.  Risking a lack of interoperability between fire alarms in individual buildings and the base station is unacceptable to the Government.  <br> The government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR 12.  This acquisition is a small business set-aside IAW FAR 19.502  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact above not later than 12:00pm CST September 19, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFQ will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit information for consideration by the Government to Mark White, Contract Specialist at the email address listed below.  Award is subject to the availability of funds.  <br>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0in; MARGIN-LEFT: 66pt"><a name="wp1192532"></a>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />Delivery vehicles are subject to search by Security Forces personnel. All tools, including assembly tools, must be secured within a toolbox in the trailer of the vehicle and should not be transported on base in the cab of the vehicle. All personnel accessing Offutt Air Force Base will be held to safety/security rules of engagement when entering and while on base. These rules include a ban on weapons to include firearms, loaded or otherwise, and the transport of any explosive material.</p>
<p>E. NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) BACKGROUND CHECK</p>
<p>1. In addition to the requirements identified in FAR 52.204-9 - Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel and AFFARS 5352.242-9000 - Contractor access to Air Force installations, all contract employees require a positive NCIC background check prior to being granted access to Offutt AFB in accordance with the installation security policy. To expedite this requirement, the contractor shall complete Attachment 3 - NCIC Data Memo for every employee proposed to perform work under this contract requiring physical access to Offutt AFB. All completed forms will be forwarded to the Agency/Customer POC listed in Section D of this clause no later than 4 business days prior to the contract start date. The Agency/Customer POC will forward the NCIC Data Memo to the below at:<br /><br />55 SFS/S5A<br />Mr. Gregory P. Derkatch<br />198 Butler Blvd.<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113<br />Phone: (402) 232-7339<br />Email: Gregory.Derkatch@offutt.af.mil</p>
<p>A memorandum shall be prepared for each follow-on/replacement employee who is not provided with the initial group of employee data. Each shall be provided no later than 3 business days prior to the proposed individuals start date.</p>
<p>2. If an individual is denied a base pass/access to the installation, the contractor is not prohibited from hiring that individual for work on this contract as long as the work entailed does not require the individual to have physical access to Offutt AFB or any of its facilities. Employees who refuse to complete the form will be denied access to the installation.</p>
<p>3. All illegal aliens are considered unauthorized individuals and will be barred from the base. Illegal aliens attempting entry or found on the installation (if incorrectly issued a pass) will be processed as an unauthorized individual and removed from the installation. In addition to notifying the contractor of the illegal alien, the Offutt AFB Security Forces will notify AF Office of Special Investigations, local police and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. Contractors are prohibited from hiring illegal aliens for work on a Government contract and the other Government agencies contacted upon discovery of the illegal may seek corrective and/or punitive actions pursuant to law against the hiring organization if violations occur.</p>
<p>4. The below list, which will be verified every 30 days during contract performance, identifies reasons why an individual, if they are identified during the NCIC check, would be denied access to Offutt AFB:</p>
<p>Disqualifiers that would deny contract employee's entry/access to the installation or its facilities:</p>
<p>- U.S. Citizenship, immigration status, or Social Security Account Number cannot be verified.<br />- Wanted by federal or civil law enforcement authorities, regardless of offense or violation.<br />- Conviction of firearms or explosives violation within the past three years.<br />- Incarcerated for 12 months or longer within the past three years, regardless of offense or violation.<br />- Conviction of espionage, sabotage, treason or terrorism, murder, sexual assault, armed assault/robbery, rape, child molestation, drug possession with intent to sell, or drug distribution.<br />- Name appears on any federal agency's "watch list" or "hit list" for criminal behavior or terrorist activity.<br />- Any other criminal activity identified on the NCIC check that the Wing Commander determines to be so serious as to pose a possible threat to the safety and security of base personnel and facilities.</p>
<p>5. A 100% Base Pass check is required for all contractors (even if a passenger in an authorized vehicle) and contract vehicles entering the installation. Contractors are not authorized to bring guests or other contract employees onto the installation unless those individuals are personally in possession of a base pass or Government Identification card.</p>
<p>F. MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE</p>
<p>1. Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB. Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle. Offutt AFB Instruction 31-204, 20 October 2010, Security, Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision states that failing to utilize seat belts or other restraints while moving will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the individual's traffic history on Offutt AFB being assessed points for the first offense. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse effect on your ability to perform your contract. Air Force Instruction 31-204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base. Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply. In addition, the following administrative penalties, as a minimum, will be imposed on drivers who are cited for speeding 10 mph - 15 mph over base housing posted speed limits: the first offense will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the individual's traffic history being assessed points. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse effect on your ability to perform your contract.</p>
<p>2. Contractor personnel are advised that vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device. The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2). Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands-free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators are subject to being stopped and ticketed solely for this offense and the individual's traffic history on Offutt AFB being assessed points for the first offense. Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse effect on your ability to perform your contract.</p>
<p>G. ANTI-TERRORISM INFORMATION AND CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>1. Base Entry: All contractor vehicles will enter through the SAC Gate and have a proper vehicle search conducted. Exceptions to this policy will be coordinated through the contracting officer and appropriate security forces personnel.</p>

Travel to and from the worksite will be made by the most direct route possible.</p>
<p>3. Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS): FPCONS describe the progressive level of countermeasures in response to a terrorist threat to US military facilities and personnel. Force Protection Condition measures are used to deter terrorist attacks on DoD facilities and personnel by:</p>
<p>(1) Varying routines.</p>
<p>(2) Being sensitive to changes in the security atmosphere around DoD facilities and personnel.<br />The five FPCONS are defined as the following:</p>
<p>(1) Normal: This condition applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture<br />(2) Alpha: This condition applies when a general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel and facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable.<br />(3) Bravo: This condition applies when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists.<br />(4) Charlie: This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely.<br />(5) Delta: This condition applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent.</p>
<p>Contractors may be asked to leave the base or not be allowed to enter the base when in elevated FPCONs.<br />For further information concerning FPCONs, contact the contracting administrator or contracting officer for additional guidance.</p>
<p>4. Contractors identified as mission essential, have been briefed on additional duties and responsibilities associated with increased FPCONs.</p>
<p>5. Suspicious Activities/Stolen Equipment: Please report any suspicious activity or stolen equipment to the Law Enforcement Desk at 294-6110.</p>

<p>7. Identification: Contractor personnel must keep base issued identification on their person while working on base.</p>
<p>H. REQUIRED INSURANCE (IAW FAR 28-306(b))</p>
<p>Reference FAR clause entitled "Insurance . . . " the Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and thereafter maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract.</p>
<p>(1) Workmen's Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance as required by law except that if this contract is to be performed in a State which does not require or permit private insurance, then compliance with the statutory or administrative requirements in any such State will be satisfactory. The required Workmen's Compensation insurance shall extend to cover employer's liability for accidental bodily injury or death and for occupational disease with a minimum liability limit of $100,000.</p>
<p>(2) General Liability Insurance. Bodily injury liability insurance, in the minimum limits of $500,000 per occurrence shall be required on the comprehensive form of policy.</p>

<p>I. SALES TAX</p>
<p>Offutt Air Force Base is exempt from paying state and local taxes on purchases that it makes per the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>Nebraska Revised Statutes, Sec. 77-2704.02 and Nebraska Sales and Use Tax Regulations 1-12 and 1-72 implement this policy and are applicable to this purchase.

Therefore, per FAR 52.229-3 or 52.229-4, applicable Nebraska State tax costs for materials should be included in the bid/proposal submitted by the offeror/contractor. <br />(End of Local Requirements)</p>

POC: SSG Ramirez Fernando, 760) 380-8894 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ??have??, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer hasfailed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.

POC: SSG Ramirez Fernando, 760) 380-8894 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ??have??, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g.,general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technicalcapability, delivery, and past performance. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 48HRS PRIOR TO CLOSING. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default <BR> <BR>

<p>BACKGROUND<br />The general mission of the Materials Measurement Science Division (MMSD) of the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is to provide research, reference materials, and data to support accurate and selective analysis of microscopic particles and surfaces including the spatial distribution of chemical species relevant to industrial, environmental, and biological processes.</p>
<p>A large part of MMSD's research involves high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of many different types of sample. These TEM samples are often made using the division's Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and in many cases ex-situ, rather than in-situ, lift-out of the thin TEM sections is required. Because of the size and delicacy of the thin sections (nominally 10 &#61549;m x 5 &#61549;m x sub-100 nm), a specialized ex-situ lift-out system is needed for this operation. This purchase is for an ex-situ lift-out system FIB prepared TEM samples.</p>

<DESC>The 188th Mission Support Contracting, 188th FW ANG intends to issue an RFQ and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Centurylink Telecommunications, 2005 N Arkansas Avenue #8, Russellville, Arkansas in order to establish a cable path and provide connectivity to directly to a subordinate unit that is geographically separated from the main base.  This purchase will be made under simplified acquisition procedures - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirement.   <br> The 188th ANG FW (Det 1) Ft. Smith, Arkansas requires a new cable path that will provide reliable data connectivity for the geographically separated unit.  This installation will ensure uninterrupted data and VOIP services are supplied.  The requirement includes installation of a new fiber cable path through an existing hand hold/duct system to building 90.  Centurylink is the local TELCO provider and owns the telecommunications cable from which the T1 signal will travel.  Therefore, no other TELCO provider can connect to the cable for a signal path.  The proprietary nature of this signal limits another vendor from establishing this connectivity.   <br> The government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact above not later than 2:00pm CST September 20, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFQ will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit information for consideration by the Government to Mark White, Contract Specialist at the email address listed below.  Award is subject to the availability of funds.  <br>
