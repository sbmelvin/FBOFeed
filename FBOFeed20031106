<DESC>NA The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving proposals for research focusing on the areas of Cleanup, Compliance, Conservation, Pollution Prevention, and Unexploded Ordna nce technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. Readers should note that this is an announcement to decla re DoD/SERDPs intent to competitively fund research and development for innovative and new environmental technologies that meet the focus areas set forth in the SERDP Program Announcement. The Program Announcement can be found on the DoD/SERDP Home Page ac cessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.serdp.org/funding/nonfed. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submi ssion of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Before preparing a proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the SERDP Program Announcement for details regarding proposal submission, the evaluation of p roposals, and the individual Statements of Need (SON). Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals nor travel to present oral presenta tions in support of the proposals. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a preproposal white paper, including a signed original copy, plus six (6) additional copies to: Ms. Brenda Batch, SERDP Program  Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821, 703-696-2127. Preproposal white papers sent via fax or electronic mail will be rejected. White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM EST on Thursday, January 8, 2004. They must be in abstract form describing the merits and objectives of the proposerÃ¢Â€Â™s project. The abstract should concisely describe what the proposer has to offer the SERDP Program and discuss (1) the proposed objective(s) and approach with a clear identificat ion of overall innovation and scientific/ technical merits; (2) the proposers capabilities and related experience, or unique combination of these which are integral factors in achieving a proposed objective; and (3) the qualifications and experience of the  principal investigator(s), team leader(s), or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Preproposal white papers should be no longer than five pages (not including the cover page), single sided, and 11 point. One attachme nt of up to three single sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page must be completed and entered via the website at https://sems.serdp-estcp.org/index.jsp  in the format specified in the Instructions. At a minimum, the preproposal whit e papers should contain: (1) a title, descriptive of the research to be performed; (2) the name and address of the individual, company or educational institution submitting the white paper; (3) the abstract of the technical objective and description of the  approach including how the approach described satisfies the focused need in the SON; (4) the duration of the project along with a milestone chart with significant events; (5) the estimated labor cost, materials cost, burdens, and profit (if any) by year; and (6) a one page curriculum vitae of the Principal Investigator(s) (not included in the five page preproposal count). Based upon the preproposal white paper evaluation by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information and may be enc ouraged to submit a full proposal by a set time and date. The format requirements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on the DOD SER DP Home Page. Each of the white paper submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The white paper review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedbac k on their technologies without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It is expected t hat awards totaling approximately $2.0 million will result. White papers and full proposals will be evaluated against the following factors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) SERDP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission responds to high -priority, mission relevant, DoD and DOE environmental requirements as described in the SON; (2) the approach, objective(s) and overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed technology; (3) potential for transition of the proposed research; (4) t he qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed objectives; (5) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds; and (6) availability o f other financial support for the proposed effort. For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small disadvantaged b usiness, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAISC) code is 541710 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. In addit ion, contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The point of contact for this  BAA for technical issues is Ms. Brenda Batch, SERDP Program Office, 703-696-2127 and for non-technical issues is Mr. James F. Bowers, HECSA, 703-428-7406.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract M67854-02-C-2015 with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration (LMSI) of Owego, NY. The contractor will be responsible for Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) efforts for 3 MEWSS PIP systems. Anticipated period of performance is FY-04 through FY-07 for a total value of $33,900,000.  The MEWSS-PIP was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Army's Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Common Sensor (IEWCS) program. The MEWSS-PIP is a suite of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment built into a U.S. Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle (LAV). It will provide state-of-the-art SIGINT and EW support to the Marine Air Ground Task Force. The MEWSS-PIP was developed to replace the fielded AN/MLQ-36 MEWSS equipment, which is increasingly unsupportable and operationally obsolete. LMSI is the MEWSS OEM.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature, within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above. See Note 22.

"	Proposed Issue Date:  November 14, 2003  "	Title of Project:  Operation and maintenance of the nationwide IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) fine particle monitoring network. "	Approximate Proposal Receipt Date: December 9, 2003  "	Description:  The National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Program Center (NRPC-Denver) Air Resources Division proposes to award a contract for the operation and maintenance of its nationwide IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) fine particle monitoring network.  The purpose of this contract is to deploy and service equipment, analyze samples for mass and elemental concentrations (hydrogen and sodium through lead) and optical absorptions, to coordinate analyses of same for certain ions and carbonaceous materials, to establish and conduct an internal quality assurance program, to conduct inter-laboratory comparisons, and to prepare summary analyses of all particulate data including ions and carbonaceous material.  This network, which was established by NPS in 1981, currently consists of 165 stations located in NPS, U.S. Forest Service, and US Fish and Wildlife Service lands.  The IMPROVE program is a cooperative measurement effort designed to establish current visibility and aerosol conditions in mandatory VPFAs to identify chemical species and emission sources responsible for existing man-made visibility impairment and to document long-term trends for assessing progress towards the national visibility goal.  The IMPROVE program is managed by a Steering Committee; the National Park Service manages the IMPROVE monitoring efforts on behalf of the steering committee.  This National Park Service solicitation covers the monitoring efforts for all mandatory class I Federal areas, as well as any other monitoring using the IMPROVE monitoring protocols.  The successful bidder will work through the National Park Service on all contractual related matters; other agencies sponsoring IMPROVE protocol monitors will work through the National Park Service to access the resources available through the proposed contract. "	Type of Procurement:  one (1) year with four (4) one (1) year options cost reimbursable contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal.  The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price, with technical capability approximately equal to an offeror's price, and will then select the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE to the government, price and technical and other factors considered.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms from price, schedule and technical standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC, has a requirement for Glass, Quartz and Teflon filters.  The quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler. The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM 2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution.  It is important that all filters of the same type from the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run.  EPA anticipates the award(s) of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity/Firm-Fixed Price/Performance Based contract(s) with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty months.   The Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts under this solicitation; one (1) for each of the three filter types (glass, quartz and teflon) as a result of this single solicitation.  Any one offeror may receive up to three (3) awards as a result of this solicitation -- one award for each filter type.  The Government intends to issue one delivery order annually for each filter type to cover the filter needs.   The minimum amount of glass filters to be ordered is 0 in the base period and 10,000 each for options I - IV; the minimum amount of quartz filters to be ordered is 0 in the base period and 60,000 each for options I - IV; the minimum amount of teflon filters to be ordered is 200,000 in the base period and 100,000 each for options I - IV.   The maximum amount of glass filters to be ordered is 0 in the base period and 35,000 each for options I - IV; the maximum amount of quartz filters to be ordered is 0 in the base period and 120,000 each for options I - IV; the maximum amount of teflon filters to be ordered is 400,000 in the base period,  500,000 each for options I - III and 1,000,000 for Option IV.    As part of the solicitation requirements, the Government intends to require offerors to submit 50 glass filters, 50 quartz filters and 50 teflon filters with their proposal.  These samples will be tested to ensure the offerors capabilities to produce acceptable samples.    The procurement will be processed as a full and open competition; however, the Government reserves the right to award as a small-business set aside.   The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract numbers 68D98028 and 68D98171 both with Whatman, Inc.  The RFP will be issued approximately 09/30/03, and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date. The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. EPA Point of Contact:  Margaret Dougherty, 919/541-2344.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Fort Collins, CO, intends to negotiate with IBP-Tyson, Lexington, NE on a sole-source basis for research samples of packing plant beef samples. Those beef animal packing plants interested in being considered for this project shall send a qualifications statement by November 13, 2003, to one of the following: Fax 970-492-7031; E-mail dick.jansen@ars.usda.gov; or mail to USDA, ARS, NPA, 2150 Centre Avenue, Building D, Suite 310, Fort Collins, CO 80526-8119. 

The U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC), Clay Center, NE, is seeking to conduct a scientific quality cutting test evaluation of the MARC beef carcass image analysis system and to purchase cuts from the carcasses used in that experiment.

The experimental protocol for the project entitled "Prediction of Beef Carcass Cut-out Yields Using the MARC Beef Image Analysis System" requires the evaluation of beef carcasses with the MARC Beef Image Analysis System and the purchase of cuts from the left side of 266 carcasses representing a diverse selection grid including U.S. Choice and U.S. Select carcasses.  Therefore, the source for these cuts must be equipped with the MARC Beef Image Analysis System and located close enough to MARC to permit completion of data collection.  

To evaluate the feasibility of this system to predict beef carcass cut-out yields under commercial processing conditions, the plant must grade carcasses at a rate of at least 300 head per hour.  Moreover, the plant must be willing to hold the carcasses after grading to allow MARC personnel sufficient time and space to collect quality and yield grade factors.  Additionally, the plant must be willing to collect scientific quality cutting test yields including accurate capture of all trim and evaluation of proximate composition.  The plant must be willing to provide the necessary labor to insure collection of accurate cut-out data.  Cuts from these carcasses must be purchased and transported to MARC for further data collection.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Community Oncology and Prevention Trials Research Group (COPTRG), intends on entering into a sole source contract with the University of North Carolina, Office of Sponsored Research, 400 W Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27599.  The National Cancer Institute launched the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) in 1983 as a mechanism for disseminating state-of-the-art cancer treatments and patient management techniques to community oncologist and their patients.  Spurred by congressional concern that the billions of dollars being spent on cancer research were having only minimal impact on cancer incidence and mortality, this program sought to accelerate the transfer of research findings to local settings by funding community-based consortia of oncologist and hospitals (CCOPs) to enroll patients in clinical trials.  The CCOPs were required to affiliate with NCI-supported clinical cooperative groups and cancer centers and to enroll a minimum of 50 patients annually on the cancer treatment protocols developed by these "research bases".  The University of North Carolina, Office of Sponsored Research at Chapel Hill is uniquely qualified to conduct this Case Study of High-Accruing Community Oncology Programs (CCOPs).  The proposed study design builds on The University of North Carolina's current study of the processes and outcomes of integrating CP/C research and CCOPs into cooperative groups (Weiner and McKinney, 2003) and the preceding CCOP evaluation conducted under previous NCI contract awards.  The University of North Carolina will make use of proprietary data collected through one-hour interviews with the principal investigators and administrtors of 23 CCOPs.  The interviews-audio taped and transcribed verbatim provide valuable baseline data on the types of CP/C protocols that are feasible for CCOPs to implement, staffing arrangements for CP/C clinical trials, and participant recruitment strategies.  Using previous data as a background, the University of North Carolina will conduct an in-depth case study of the strategies that differentiate high-accruing CCOPs from those with average accrual.  The University of North Carolina is the only source known to the NCI researchers that can provide the necessary data/services required for this procurement.  However, if any interested party believes that it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capability.  The capability statement and any information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail with the necessary documentation to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  All questions should be directed to Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent at (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This requirement is being procured based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 611710.  Please include the solicitation number RFQ-NCI-40008-NQ on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

DESCRIPTION:  HQ, Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) intends to release a Request for Proposal and Draft Performance Work Statement for a Personal Property Management System for DoD and the U.S. Coast Guard, as stipulated throughout CONUS and O CONUS.  The objective system will be modular, using best of breed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software applications.  The end-to-end system must accommodate all aspects of personal property to include customer survey entry and feedback, facilitating cl aims preparation and settlement, entitlement/move counseling, claims metrics, costing shipments, TP rate filing, Storage-in-Transit a direct reporting capabilities, and the ability to interface with DoD systems.  Additional functionality to be added in the  future includes Direct Procurement Method (DPM), Non-Temporary Storage (NTS), and support for Intra-Theater Contracts.  The Defense Personal Property System (DPS) will employ cutting edge technology and best practices to build a single, paperless DoD pers onal property program that integrates and automates all processes that support DoDs familiesÃ¢Â€Â™ moves worldwide. Currently DoD uses the Transportation Operational Personal Property Standard system (TOPS).   Over 200 Personal Property Shipping Offices cu rrently utilize TOPS.  MTMC is developing the Centralized Web Application (CWA) as an interim web-based solution to integrate with TOPS to handle the automated approval of shipments and cost shipments using a Government rating engine.  MTMC is looking to r eplace TOPS and the CWA functionality, which interfaces with U.S. Banks PowerTrack, a web-based commercial business-to-business payment system.  MTMCs goal is to have DPS available in time to begin moving shipments on 1 October 2005.  DPS rate filing and e valuation functionality is expected to be delivered, tested, and in production in time for the TPs to file rates on 1 August 2005.  These rates will be effective on 1 October 2005.  DPS move counseling and shipment management capabilities is expected to be  delivered, tested, and in production in time to begin counseling customers on 1 September 2005.

<DESC>NA Big Sioux River at Sioux Falls, South Dakota Flood Protection Project Phase 2B The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District (USACE) is preparing plans and specifications to raise the existing levee system to provide 100-year flood protection along the Big Sioux River and Skunk Creek within the City of Sioux Falls.  In order to mi nimize the length of levee to be raised along the Big Sioux River, the USACE is considering constructing a dam on the Big Sioux River immediately upstream of the confluence with Skunk Creek. The dam will be located adjacent to an area of recent commercial development.  As a result, the City of Sioux Falls prefers an inflatable structure that will have minimal visual impact during low-flow conditions.  During a flood event, the dam should be ca pable of being erected to its full-height position within one hour by automated means.  Back-up power will be required to ensure satisfactory operation in the event of a power outage.  The dam may be subjected to a variety of flow conditions during a flood  event.    The attached link shows a cross section through the river and existing levee system at the desired location of the dam.  The approximate span length measured from the top of the levees is 240 feet.  The maximum required vertical span of the structure measu red from the channel invert is approximately 27 feet.   The ftp address below contains two files showing this cross-section, one in AutoCAD (.dwg) the other in Bentley MicroStation (.dgn) format.   ftp://ftp.nwo.usace.army.mil/pub/SiouxFalls/NewDam If you have a product capable of meeting these requirements, submit the following information as a minimum: 1.Product information complete with sketches, details, and photos 2.List of locations where the product has been installed along with a point of contact including telephone number or e-mail address for each installation   3.Information regarding applicability compliance with the Buy American Act (e.g., foreign or domestic components, place of manufacture, etc.) 4.Business Classification (e.g., large business, small disadvantaged business, etc.) Submittals should be received not later than December 5, 2003.

<DESC>Solicitation N00421-03-R-0150 is not issued as a Request for Proposal.  The purpose of this notice is to notify interested parties that the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, St. Inigoes, MD 20684 plans to negotiate and issue on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price contract with Powersystems International, Inc. (PSI), 860 Douglas Way, Natural Bridge Station, VA  24579.  The requirement consist of the following items:  CLIN 0001 - Trailers with generator systems, Qty 7 each, P/N:  2001203, CLIN 0002 – Air Ducts Qty 14, P/N:  3001394-002, and Transport Bags, Qty 14, P/N:  4000237.  All of which will support the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) Mobile Integrated Communications System (JMICS) 12A-15A Project.   These power trailers are required to provide energy and environmental control to vital communication systems of the JMICS System; without which mission critical intelligence will be lost in the field.    These trailers provide indispensable transportation storage space of other JMICS components.  The power trailers must meet basic mobility/transportability certification requirements for usage on secondary and unimproved roads established by the U.S. Army Tank and Automotive Command (TACOM).   Additionally, the DAMI-IM mandates the subject trailers comply with Military Transport Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMCEA) standards for internal airlift and sea-lift transportability and Natick External Air Transport requirements for two point lift without spreader bar by CH-47 and CH-53 helicopter, as well as, transportation safety criteria established by the MTMCEA.  These trailers must not exceed the maximum tongue weight or fall short of the required fuel tank capacity.  Powersystems International, Inc is the only known vendor with the capability of supplying the requirements to fulfill this requirement.  Prior to award, the power trailers must meet basic mobility/transportability certification requirements for usage on secondary and unimproved roads established by the US Army Tank and Automotive Command (TACOM).  The PSI power trailers meet Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) technical, form, fit, function and environmental specifications, as well as, the current certification for air transportability.  These power trailers were previously fielded with JWICS 11A, therefore providing identical equipment for follow-on JWICS units.  The PSI power trailers have been field tested with the project equipment, and have been proven to meet the required interface specifications in tactical environments.  Deviation from the specified model will present the DIA with significant compatibility obstacles.  Award is expected November 18, 2003.    However, the Government will consider all proposals received by 17 November 2003.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested parties may identify their technical capabilities and may submit information that shall be considered by the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division.   A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The Government will not pay for any information received.  Responses to this synopsis should be sent via email to gertrude.scriber@navy.mil or phone at (301) 995-8925.

<DESC>This notice is amended to delete all references to Glass and Quartz Filters.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC , has a requirement for Teflon Filters. The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM 2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal  2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.  The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of  raw materials for distribution.  It is important that all filters or the same type from the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run. EPA anticipates the award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity/Firm-Fixed Price/Performance Based Award Term contract.  The contract to be awarded as a result of full and open competition and the subject solicitation will contain a twelve (12)- month base period and four twelve (12) -month award term options.  The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty (60) months.  The Government intends to issue one delivery order annually for teflon filters  to cover the filter needs.   The minimum amount of teflon filters to be ordered is 200,000 in the base period and 100,000 each in Options I - IV.  The maximum amount of teflon filters to be ordered in the base period is 400,000 and 500,000 each in Options I-III. The maximum amount of teflon filters to be ordered in Option IV is 1,000,000.  Specifications and references for the teflon filters are outlined in the SOW for the previous contract which can be viewed at the acquisition planning website:  http://yosemite1.epa.gov/oarm/oam/forecastdatabase.nsf.  View Document Number 146.   As part of the solicitation requirements, the Government intends to require offerors to submit 50 teflon filters with their proposal.  These samples will be tested to ensure the offerors' capabilities to produce acceptable samples.  The procurement will be processed as a full and open competition.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract number 68D98028 with Whatman, Inc.  The RFP will be issued approximately 11/14/03 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  As previously stated the solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.

Points of Contact: George Brost, AFRL Program Manager, (315) 330-7669, email: George.Brost@rl.af.mil, Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate, Photonics Processing Branch, Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to advance the technology in the area of microwave photonics, addressing the application of photonics technology to the generation, distribution, and processing of analog microwave signals as well as the application of photonics to the digitization of microwave signals. Areas of interest include devices, components, techniques, systems and applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, efficient external modulators, high power detectors, low RIN sources, highly linear modulators, optical techniques for microwave signal generation, low pulse jitter lasers for analog to digital converters, analog fiber optic links, true time delay, optical control of phased array antennas, optical signal processors, integration of photonic devices and circuits, system design and modeling. Deliverables will include technical reports and, when appropriate, technology demonstrations to prove out the concepts proposed and components and devices developed. Principal funding for proposals selected from this announcement begins in FY01. Individual awards will not normally exceed twenty-four (24) months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Total funding for the BAA is $4,500,000. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Renee Arcuri, (315) 330-4777, for information if they contemplate responding. THIS PUBLICATION ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a two (2) to ten (10) page white paper on their proposed research topic to: Air Force Research Laboratory/SNDP, ATTN: Mr. George Brost, 25 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4115. White papers must reference BAA 01-05-IFKPA. White papers will be accepted until 30 Sep 2004, however, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY01-16 Apr 2001, FY02-30 Jan 2002, FY03-30 Jan 2003, FY04-30 Jan 2004. Multiple white papers addressing different areas of applicability may be submitted by each offeror and are encouraged. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Offeror; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Each white paper will be evaluated within thirty days of receipt and a letter will be sent to each offeror either encouraging or discouraging the submission of a proposal. Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the letter requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Proposals submitted as the result of a favorable white paper will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the Air Force Research Laboratory mission, (3) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives, (4) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives; and (5) Cost Benefits. The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  An informational briefing is not planned, but may be scheduled should conditions warrant. A copy of the AFRL/IFK "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission, reference BAA 01-05-IFKPA. All responses to this announcement must reference the above topic as well as BAA-01-05-IFKPA. This announcement is open and effective until 30 Sep 2004. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<CONTACT>brentwood39, 703-428-3476
<DESC>NA SOURCES SOUGHT:  This Sources Sought is to identify business capability necessary to perform the Assured Access Rail requirement for the Military Traffic Management Command.  This business capability may include the purchase, lease, maintenance, distributi on, a combination of these, and other services as articulated by the service provider industry that may be of value to the Government.  The Government faces a potential shortfall in the number of available rail flat cars that will be available for its use during contingency operations between now and beyond 2014.  The Government intends to work with industry to? buy lease and manufacture rail cars that include Ã¢Â€ÂœDefense Rail FeaturesÃ¢Â€Â (see attached).  The Government is attempting to confirm the val idity of the perceived shortage by determining: 1.	Current rail car providers planned future manufacture/purchase of rail flat cars that may be made available to the Government on a priority basis to move military cargo negating the severity of the impact of currently available rail cars whose service h as been extended 10 years and whose service will end in 2014 2.	Sources available that manufacture rail flatcars and the current purchase price for that commodity. 3.	Sources available that lease rail flat cars and the current lease rates for that commodity. 4.	The existence of service providers that offer a combination of the aforementioned services.     Accordingly: Provide an estimate for the Government to purchase between 3000 and 6000 new rail flat cars with defense rail features.  Please provide any published associated scheduled maintenance program.  Identify whether or not the Vendor offers maintenance agreement s to purchaserÃ¢Â€Â™s of its rail cars either directly or through third party.  If so, please provide a current commercial schedule of cost (best commercial terms).    Please provide a notional delivery schedule that would apply to a similar purchase  The contractor must ensure that the flat cars meet both U.S. and Canadian Customs requirements for entering and exiting Canada. Provide an estimate for the Government to lease to the between 3000 and 6000 rail flat cars with defense rail features.  Please provide any published associated scheduled maintenance program.  Identify whether or not the Vendor offers maintenance agreement s to purchaserÃ¢Â€Â™s of its rail cars either directly or through third party.  If so, please provide a current commercial schedule of cost (best commercial terms).    The Government assumes that offers of service from rail service providers take into account that the service contractor will continue to use and maintain these flatcars for normal commercial business but will adhere to the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s requirement to make identified railcars available to the Government within one business day, any or all of the flatcars available for U.S. Government use when the Government identifies its requirement to be associated with a declared emergency, declared contingency, huma nitarian relief mission or any other declared operation by the Secretary of Defense, whose agent will be the Commander, TRANSCOM.  The notification to the firm will be in written form (authenticated email or letter (faxed or expressed mailed)). The contractor must ensure that the flat cars meet both U.S. and Canadian Customs requirements for entering and exiting Canada. All potential contractors shall submit a portfolio of your capabilities by 1:00PM EST on 18 November 2003 to the following individuals:  Mr. Stan Harris, Contract Specialist, Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), ATTN:  MTAQ-D, 200 Stovall Street, Ho ffman II, Alexandria, VA  22332 or Mr. Edward G.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROGRAM 2004.1.  Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2004.1, which was publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Oct 1, 2003.   The 2004.1 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Dec 1, 2003 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, January 15, 2004.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal.  Nine DoD components will participate in the 2004.1 solicitation – the Department of the Navy; the Department of the Air Force; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); the Missile Defense Agency (MDA); the Office of Secretary of Defense/Director, Defense Research and Engineering (OSD); the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM); the Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBD); and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA).  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms."

<SUBJECT>D -- PCGN (VSAT) Extension and Q&A
<DESC>Regarding the subject requirement (see 16 and 23 SEP 2003 announcements for "Peace Corps Global Network by Very Small Aperture Terminal"), please be advised that the Govt continues to be under a Continuing Resolution (tentatively through 30 NOV 2003) and expenditures for any new activities (such as an award) are restricted. Therefore, the response date and time for interested parties to submit a technical proposal with cost elements is hereby extended to no later than Noon (12pm local Washington DC time) on Wednesday, 03 DEC 2003. In accordance with Note 22, the Govt intends to evaluate proposals received on a Best Value (technical approach equal to or more important than price) basis and will formally determine whether to proceed with an award to Verestar of Hagerstown MD or conduct an expedited competition based on initial offers. The following are replies to questions submitted by interested parties (Peace Corps technical point of contact is Michael Porter, T: 202/692-1340): Q1: "What are the interconnect/interface points on the Peace Corps voice and data networks and what specifications are needed by the vendor to ensure that a solution has the ability to interface and interconnect with said networks?" A1: Peace Corps is not focused on data at this time; end points can get Internet connectivity from the provider. Peace Corps contemplates voice services to be tied to its Avaya Definity G3SI PBX. Q2: "Is the Peace Corps currently using a third party’s NMS for Linkway 2000 terminals and must the vendor’s solution be based solely on the Linkway 2000 system? If yes, what NMS system? If a NMS is currently in use by the Peace Corps for existing Linkway 2000 terminals may the vendor access this same NMS?" A2: Please be advised that Peace Corps does not currently use the referenced system and intends to not keep its current system. Q3: "What system, antenna size, and frequency band does the Peace Corps have at the current sites? On the RF equipment, what size transmitter (2-watts, 4-watts, 10-watts, etc.)?" A3: Peace Corps only has one current site and that equipment will be replaced. Antenna size will be different from site to site. Q4: "Does Peace Corps require immediate global coverage? Where are the other 13 sites mentioned?" A4: Please be advised that the Peace Corps contemplates the Republic of Guinea as the first site, with others subject to availability of funds. Q5: "Does the Peace Corps want Frame Relay, IP, or ATM, or a combination? Which are preferred and which are required at each site?" A5: Peace Corps prefers an IP solution. Q6: "For the multilingual speaking operations staff 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, which languages are required and at what times?" A6: Please be advised that the Peace Corps contemplates primarily using English; however, since most sites using VSAT will be in Africa, ability to communicate in French will be necessary. Q7: "Can the vendor propose an alternative solution to the Linkway system?" A7: YES. Q8: "Is there a formal response/format required to this RFQ?" A8: Please submit your proposal in Microsoft Excel and Word 2000 compatible formats. Offerors may also submit their proposals in a compressed file (.zip) or image (Adobe Acrobat .pdf) formats.

Q9: "Is the solution required a single hardware platform managed service using Linkway, i.e. all remote sites have identical hardware, full mesh connectivity for all 15 sites?" A9: Please be advised that Peace Corps contemplates a Cisco solution but is not specifically tied to a single platform. However, the intent of the PCGN is to have all sites as identical as possible for troubleshooting and training, as well as any applicable volume discount pricing. Q10: "What is the contract term?" A10: Please be advised that the Peace Corps intends to negotiate and award to a single vendor a firm, fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (see FAR 16 FFP IDIQ – estimated minimum/maximum quantity), with a one-year base performance period and up to two (2) one-year options; in order to deploy up to 15 sites by the end of FY05 (SEPT 2005) as originally contemplated.

<SUBJECT>U -- Education Services in Survey Methodology
<DESC>The U. S. Census Bureau intends to extend on a sole source basis contract 50-YABC-0-66009 with the University of Maryland (UM).  The extension will be for an additional 24 (24) months for UM to continue to manage and develop education programs in survey methodology under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   This requirement is for the continuation of the five-year master and doctoral degree programs currently in process at UM.  The University has been providing the Census Bureau with a curriculum of courses specialized in the field of survey research and methodology.  These services continue to be required to meet the Census Bureau’s need for training professionals in the emerging inter disciplinary field of survey research and methodology.  The extension consists of two additional one-year options to the current contract. The services provided under this contract require an inherent knowledge and expertise of survey methodology, theories and practices in probability and statistics.  The Government has determined that award through competition would require a substantial duplication of the cost that would not be recovered through competition and would create an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Census Bureau mission.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address (Attn: Patti Becker).  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a modification to the existing contract will be issued without further notice.

·	Owner will provide adequate lifting slings.
·	The lifting/transport cradle is suitable for one or two point lift.
·	Owner will deliver the lifting/transport cradle to mutually agreed point in Manila, TBD.
·	Notwithstanding anything in this charter party to the contrary, Owner will be responsible to provide all tug services to conduct load and discharge operations whether the vessel is LO/LO or FLO/FLO and the cost is to be included in lump sum rate. 
·	Owner will provide diving services for loading operations, if required.
·	Request owners supply general arrangements and capacity plans with offer. 

(1) Ship Drawings.  If other than liner terms, owner shall provide detailed ship drawings suitable for the preparation of stow plans no later than 72 hours prior to Vessel’s arrival at the designated loading port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports).  Include any unusual obstructions or characteristics not readily discernable from deck drawings.  If award is made within 72 hours of ship’s arrival at the designated load port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports), plans of Vessel’s deck shall be made available within 24 hours of award.

(2) Cargo Handling Equipment List.  If other than liner terms, Owner shall provide a list of cargo handling equipment on the ship no later than 72 hours prior to Vessel’s arrival at the designated loading port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports).  If award is made within 72 hours of ship’s arrival at the designated load port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports), the cargo equipment list shall be made available within 24 hours of award.  

(3) Crew List.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the Vessel.

(4) Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide any of the information or drawings described in paragraphs (1) through (3), above, within the prescribed time frames shall be considered as time excluded under clause III(k)(3).

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.

(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets, said cost to be included in the offered rate.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: DEMURRAGE/DETENTION DOCUMENTATION.  In the event of demurrage/detention, all supporting documents as identified in the invoicing clause shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage/detention invoices.  After receiving the Contracting Officer's concurrence, Owner may submit demurrage/detention invoices to the office identified in Box 18b of SF 1449.
