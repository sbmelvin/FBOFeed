<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV), in collaboration with the Space and Missile Systems Center, Military Satellite Communications Directorate (SMC/MC), and NASA Glenn Research Center, plan to conduct fundamental research to increase knowledge and understanding of atmospheric effects on radio frequency signal propagation. Specifically, the objective is to statistically characterize channel propagation effects in the V (71 - 76 GHz) and W (81 - 86 GHz) frequency bandwidths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Channel propagation effects can include, for example, signal attenuation, phase dispersion, and depolarization. It is necessary to correlate the long-term channel behavior to atmospheric and meteorological parameters. Measured data will be used to develop and validate modeling and design tools that can be used to design and assess future military satellite communication architectures.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC><p>SMC/SB: 14-022</p>
<p>The purpose of this Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA) is to announce the Government's intention to pursue a Sole Source procurement for the Combined Orbital Operations Logistics Sustainment (COOLS) requirement. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to further evaluate capability briefs, release a competitive solicitation, or award a contract. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201, a sources sought synopsis was posted to FedBizOpps (FBO) on 20 February 2013, titled Consolidated Orbital Operations, Logistics Sustainment Support (COOLSS) - FA8223_COOLSS with the NAICS of 541330, size standard of $35.5M, and Service Classification Code of R425, Engineering and Technical Services. Seven firms provided statements of capabilities in response to the FBO sources sought posting. Only one was determined to have the immediate capabilities to meet the Government's requirement, Lockheed Martin Corporation Space Systems Company. Some firms were found to possess the capabilities necessary to meet a narrow subset of the stated requirements; however no single source other than Lockheed Martin Corporation Space Systems Company could meet the full set of requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to the above market research, the Government considered breaking out those portions of the requirement where competition might be possible. The Government's analysis concluded that the breakout was not a feasible approach to meeting the requirement, nor would significant benefits be gained through competition as compared to the potential duplication of costs by having two contractors perform the requirement. Furthermore, given the Government's limited ownership of technical and software data on the Milstar system, it was determined the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) was the only vendor capable of providing the highly specialized service skill-set required to sustain an aging operational constellation.</p>
<p>Based upon the results of the market research conducted, and the aforementioned Government analysis, the Government will acquire the services on a sole source basis.

<p>Service Contract: Lasers; Each of the seven lasers is charged and covered as a separate line item.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) are a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), supporting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases</p>
<p>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), purchased in 2011 the InFlux, the leading-edge cell sorter in the NIAMS Flow Cytometry Service. It provides an efficient analysis system that advances the research projects of many NIAMS investigators. Using seven high-powered laser light sources (ultraviolet, violet, blue-violet,blue, light green, yellow and red), the InFlux can simultaneously detect up to 20 differenct fluorochromes with high sensitivity and specificity for sorting up to four target populations into tubes and multi-well plates. The InFlux cell sorter continues to be the most capable sorter for NIAMS investigators.</p>
<p>Also purchased in 2011 the LSR Fortessa SORP with HTS (High Throughput Sampler) is the leading-edge cytometer in the NIAMS Flow Cytometry Service. It provides an efficient analysis system that advances the research projects of many NIAMS investigators. <br /><br />Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) request the purchase of a service/maintenance agreement for the LSR Fortessa SORP and the InFlux Cell Sorter operated by the NIAMS Flow Cytometry Service of the Office of Science of Science and Technology. The service/maintenance agreement shall provide reliable, uninterrupted operation of the equipment in order to assist the NIAMS investigators with the advancement of their research projects.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />This is a fixed price purchase for a twelve (12) month Base Year from the date of award with a One Year Option Period. <br /><br />Project Description</p>
<p>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) Flow Cytometry Service of the Office of Science and Technology request the purchase of a service /maintenance agreement for the BD Biosciences (BDB) InFlux Cell Sorter, SN: X64650000054 and the LSR Fortessa SORP, SN: H64717700017 with HTS (High Throughput Sampler), SN: U64770100205.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases <br />(NIAMS), Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Office of Science and Technology provide state of the art flow cytometry services to the NIAMS community. Proper maintenance and service for the BD LSR Fortessa SORP and the InFlux Cell Sorter is necessary to assure reliable, uninterrupted operation of these instruments which allows the researchers to achieve the NIAMS mission. <br />Other Important Considerations</p>
<p>BD Biosciences (BDB) is the sole vendor to provide the proposed service contract for the NIAMS LSR Fortessa SORP with HTS (High Throughput Sampler) and the InFlux cell sorter. The LSR Fortessa and the InFlux are currently covered by the BDB installation warranty; no third-party vendor has the knowledge or the access to the parts proprietary to BDB, which might be needed for repairs. Moreover, any modifications done to the instrument by a third party potentially disallow any future coverage.</p>
<p>Presently, the Flow Cytometry Section (FCS) in the Office of Science and Technology of NIAMS IRP operates and maintains three cell sorters to support the NIAMS mission. Proper maintenance and service by BD Biosciences is required to assure reliable, uninterrupted operation of the 7-laser LSR Fortessa SORP with HTS (High Throughput Sampler) and the InFlux cell sorter. Both instruments are integral to achieving the NIAMS mission.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research. In conclusion the findings are that BD Biosciences, is the sole manufacturer and provider of maintenance service for the BD LSR Fortessa and the BD InFlux Cell Sorter flow cytometry system. A Sources Sought Notice was posted in FedBizOpps under Solicitation number HHS-NIH-NHLBI-CSB-(AR)-SBSS-2014-034-RMD and received no capability statements in response to the notice.BD Biosciences does not certify third party organizations to perform service on its instrumentation in the United States and as the original manufacturer can ensure the supply of spare or replacement parts, which are unique to BD LSR Fortessa and the BD InFlux Cell Sorter flow cytometry system. When an instrument is covered by BD Biosciences Maintenance Service Agreement, BD Biosciences is the only provider that can supply: instrument software revisions along with preventative maintenance inspections, technical telephone consulting and unlimited on-site service visits. A sole Source Letter from manufacturer has been provided.</p>

<DESC>SPTT Pre Solicitation Notice

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, an order under the existing N00019-12-G-0006 Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Class Justification and Approval (CJ&A) with the Bell Boeing Joint Project Office (BB JPO) located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) has a requirement for the modification of the V-22 Sponson Part Task Trainer (SPTT), Device 11H166, located at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, Jacksonville, North Carolina (NC).
 This modification incorporates V-22 aircraft platform Technical Directives V-22 AFC 274 and V-22 AFC 275 required for the SPTT to maintain concurrency with production aircraft, and makes required trainer modifications to ensure SPTT functionality meets United States Marine Corps (USMC) training requirements.

BB JPO, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the of the V-22 aircraft platform and V-22 aircraft maintenance training devices procured to date, is the only responsible source capable of upgrading the V-22 Sponson Part Task Trainer (SPTT), device.  This modification must be performed in parallel with aircraft development using aircraft engineering data, not previously delivered to the Government, in order to be able to provide concurrent training prior to delivery of the new aircraft configurations.
 Further, concurrent training prior to delivery of the new aircraft configurations is essential for fleet readiness to support operations overseas and reduce aircraft operating costs associated with using the aircraft for training. As such, it is not possible for any other source to upgrade the existing training device to the new configuration.

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice pursuant to FAR 5.203(a).  Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by providing its fully supported rationale via email to Winward Truitt, winward.truitt@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 9 January 2014 at 1300 EST.
 All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available.  If no written response to this synopsis is received, the approved BOA CJ&A as mentioned above in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 will be utilized.

The purpose of this notice under FAR 15.201 is to provide potential companies the maximum amount of time to develop proposals and to form teaming agreements if required. DOL intends to award a single firm fixed price contract with other direct cost (ODC) pass-throughs. This contract will be awarded to a single prime Contractor for execution of all tasks resulting from this solicitation. DOL will use performance-based contracting in execution of this contract. The NAICS code for this requirement is 524298 and the size standard is $7 million. The base period of performance of the proposed contract is anticipated to be one year with four one-year options, and up to two one-year award terms for outstanding performance - for a total potential performance period of seven years.<br /><br />The solicitation will be distributed solely through Federal Business Opportunities web site, http://www.fbo.gov.

OWCP's medical bill processing function is currently performed as a contracted service. The Government does not own an information system that can be transferred to a follow-on Contractor. Only historical data will be transferred.<br /><br />This centralized solution will include the processes associated with receipt of the medical bills and attachments, review of medical bills and attachments against program-specific authorizations, handling of inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers, and utilization of business rules established by each OWCP program for the adjudication and pricing of medical bills. Specifically, the integrated system will support the following capabilities:<br />&bull; Receipt and accounting for medical bills, attachments and other documents, in both hardcopy and electronic formats<br />&bull; Scanning and data entry of bills, attachments and other documents received.<br />&bull; Processing of bills to payment or denial (the Contractor will not make benefit payments, but will transfer payment files to Treasury for certification and payment)<br />&bull; Processing of requests for adjustment, authorization of services, suspense resolution, and appeals processing<br />&bull; Processing and responding to submitted correspondence received from medical providers and claimants, when applicable, and storing the responses to the correspondence in an imaging system from which the Government can retrieve for review<br />&bull; Enrolling new providers and managing information about existing providers<br />&bull; Providing claimant and provider support via a call center and self-service applications (such as user access portals and IVR)<br />&bull; Processing Point of Sale (POS) pharmacy bills<br />&bull; Providing secure on-line access, available to authorized users, to view images of bills, correspondence, and other documents.<br /><br />PROGRAM OBJECTIVES<br />The goal of the WCMBP program is to acquire a standards-based medical bill processing system and processes that implement the following:<br />&bull; Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput, accuracy, and efficiency<br />&bull; Ensure a smooth and timely transition from the incumbent service provider<br />&bull; Ensure efficient, accurate and timely processing of medical and pharmacy bills <br />&bull; Ensure timely and correctly processed authorizations for covered benefits. <br />&bull; Provide accurate and timely responses to customer inquiries and requests. <br />&bull; Implement advanced medical bill processing technologies and processes<br />&bull; Develop robust fraud and abuse and error detection/protection processes<br />&bull; Use of industry-standard hosting and programming techniques to support portability among platforms<br />&bull; Implement robust change and configuration management process<br />&bull; Establish a framework for continuous improvement<br /><br />RFP RELEASE DATE: ON OR ABOUT 10 JANUARY 2014<br />

<DESC>1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Human Systems Division (AFLCMC/WNU) is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to respond to the requirements listed in this document. AFLCMC is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to explore cost effective options to provide this capability. This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.
<p><br />2. AFLCMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>3. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>5. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.<br /><br />6. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>7. Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace.<br />The Air Force Uniform Office (AFUO) is conducting market research seeking information from Industry on commercially available or non-developmental cold weather flame resistant boots that can be worn during flight operations and provide protection from arctic weather conditions. See Attachment 1 for salient characteristics. The AFUO is looking for boots that have been evaluated in accordance with as many material and end item tests as possible, as provided for reference in Attachment 2. Boots not meeting test requirements or not having been tested on each requirement will be considered. Identify if any boot test results provided in response incorporated socks as part of any boot test conducted. If so, identify the sock used by manufacturer and style number, fiber blend, material content, finishes and any special construction details. Safe-to-Fly requirements have been included in Attachment 3. Preferred material and end item test data have been provided for information only and data on boots made of different materials or not passing all tests will be considered. All attachments are to help vendors understand the properties and performance we are considering, not to eliminate items from consideration. The AFUO is looking for expressions of interest and capability statements. Only Berry Amendment compliant materials/capabilities or Berry waivered materials and information should be submitted.<br /><br />RESPONSE GUIDANCE: Please provide a white paper describing capabilities and a concept of how the boots' attributes meet some or all of the requirements in <strong>Attachments 1 and 2</strong>. Cold weather performance data in any format will be accepted (describe any assumptions or methods used to deduce cold weather performance). Include technical data sheets for physical properties. Sample items or sample components may be included. Include current unit price, per a published price list, for each boot described. Respondents should include their willingness to participate in future solicitations if most testing requirements will be at the respondent's expense. Respondents should also include a description of the company's background and experience and any other information that the respondents believe demonstrate value, performance and capabilities. As papers are received and reviewed, additional materials and/or information may be requested. Please submit responses by <strong>23 January 2014</strong> to the Point of Contact (POC) identified below.</p>
<p>RFI Responses: <br />1. Please provide your RFI responses to daniel.stephens@us.af.mil by 5:00pm EST on <strong>23 January 2014</strong>. Title e-mail responses in the subject line of the e-mail as follows: "Response to CWAS Boot RFI # WNUK-14-005."</p>
<p>2. Please limit your responses to no more than 15 pages and identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response to this RFI.<br /><br />3. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. All questions will be answered via posting answers to this FBO website; except as provided above. Additionally, questions must NOT contain trade secrets or classified information.</p>
<p>4. Respondents should indicate which portions of their responses are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ). NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services with a small business size standard of $14 million.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Health literacy has become a well-established area of study. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a health literacy working group that coordinates NLM's work with similar working groups administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) also has an active health literacy interest group among its membership.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed, a one-stop (Internet-based) location, will create an arena where researchers can obtain many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve the methodological quality of health literacy research. The Health Literacy Tool Shed represents a service that provides outreach to health literacy professionals. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to find many of the available constructs and quantitative tools used to measure health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research. Although the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the project is designed to create a needed educational resource.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will organize constructs, measures, and instruments that are currently scattered across an array of health literacy research. There is no current resource where practitioners and researchers can consult what health literacy measurement measures, constructs, and instruments are best suited to a planned project. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information on health literacy assessment instruments, this foundational gap inhibits the field's development as a coherent body of knowledge and practice. The end of methodological fragmentation in the health literacy field (and the availability of a website to find the best instruments for specific projects) also will assist NLM's future health literacy research and help make NLM a leader in health literacy research and practice.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be unique educational resource. While this type of resource often is touted by health literacy researchers and practitioners, currently it does not exist nor is a similar resource under construction or consideration elsewhere.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance shall be a 12-month base period with (1) additional 12-month option period. The proposed contract type will be firm fixed price.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective</p>
<p>This Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach project creates a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. While the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the current project creates an educational resource that provides outreach to a research community as well as a topic of interest to the NLM.</p>
<p>The project will create a one-stop website, where researchers can assess many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve health literacy research. The proposed Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will provide a vital outreach service for the health literacy research community. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to identify and assess many of the available constructs and quantitative measures used to assess health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research in one, accessible location.</p>
<p>Although dozens of health literacy measurement tools have been introduced and the literature has proliferated, a core problem in health literacy outreach and intervention efforts is the uneven quality of methods used by health literacy assessment teams and a confusing array of constructs, measures, and instruments. Some examples of the current methodological confusion and fragmentation in health literacy research is found in Appendix A, which suggests there are at least 15 separate measures based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy. Appendix A also notes there are nine different measures based in the Test of Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) as well as many other constructs and measures of aspects of health literacy.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread availability of health literacy measurement tools, criticisms from independent reviewers reflect that health literacy research methodological flaws may stem from a lack of infrastructure to support health literacy researchers and practitioners. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information about health literacy assessment constructs, measures, and instruments, the gap impedes the health literacy field's development into a more coherent body of knowledge and practice. <br /><br />The Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will create for the first time: 1) access to health literacy assessment tools; 2) a health literacy tool selection process for investigators; 3) an overview of researcher adherence to various health literacy instruments; and, 4) background information about a construct/measure's validity or empirical validation.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a virtual indexing system for health literacy methods with specific information on the following:</p>
<p>&#9679; Administration instructions (how long it takes to administer, number of questions, languages, method of administration, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679; Constructs measured (i.e. numeracy, word pronunciation, problem solving, general health maintenance, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679; Links to the instruments (or information on how to obtain the instrument when the Contractor has not secured permission to post the instrument) and to validation articles</p>
<p>&#9679; Expert commentary on strengths and limitations and on how to select instruments in various research and practice contexts.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed also could identify some gaps in the current array of health literacy instruments and provide a venue for users to discuss the development of further health literacy research assessment tools.

<DESC>Background and Purpose:
<p>This public posting is for informational, planning, and market research purposes only and constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and a Sources Sought Request (SSR) only. This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that a solicitation or procurement will be issued. This is not a solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), or Invitation for Bids (IFB). No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.</p>
<p>The purpose of this public posting is to give contractors the opportunity to comment on the United States Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) draft requirement; all associated documents are considered draft versions. Responses to this announcement will also assist CBP in making a set-aside for small business determination as required by FAR 19.5.</p>
<p>This is a draft set-aside requirement for contractors under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Tactical Communications (TacCom) Equipment &amp; Services IDIQ, specifically, those under IDIQ Technical Category Thee (TC3), Infrastructure Services. Depending on the market research findings and responses to this announcement, this draft requirement may potentially be set aside to TC 3 contractors that qualify as Small Businesses under the size standard for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330-Engeneering Services. However, a set-aside determination has not yet been made, so all TacCom contractors, both large and small, are encouraged to respond to this announcement.</p>
<p>Draft Requirement Overview:</p>
<p>CBP is seeking TC3 contractors who have the skills and capabilities to complete CBP Land Mobile Radio (LMR) site engineering design analysis, the purchase of the required project equipment and materials, LMR site development, LMR site equipment configuration, and system/site installation, integration, and testing for a total of seven (7) sites around the CBP Arizona, Tucson and Yuma Focus Area, as required by the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>The required onsite work at six (6) of the seven (7) total sites must be completed from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, with an Optional CLIN for work to be performed on the sixth site from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. To allow time for coordination and staging prior to the onsite work, the anticipated period of performance for the Base Period is April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015, and the period of performance for the Option Period is from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015. This is a draft requirement, so the period of performance is not firm/final.</p>
<p>This draft requirement constitutes a single project, however per the draft SOW, access to the sites is only seasonally available and the optional CLIN cannot be exercised until the deliverables/work required for the six (6) other sites has been accepted. Consequently, there is an extended period of time between the initial period of onsite activity (for the 6 Base Period sites) and the second period of activity for the Optional site.</p>
<p>Capability Statement Request:</p>
<p>Interested contractors are requested to provide a Capability Statement that demonstrates and describes the contractor's work experience, capability, and expertise necessary to satisfying all requirements within the draft SOW. Specifically, at a minimum, the contractor's Capability Statement should address the six (6) areas of expertise outlined in the following text.</p>
<p>The specific areas of expertise for the Capability Statement are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Communication Site/Tower Development, Installation, and Integration<br />2) Radio Communication Site or System Configuration, Testing, and Implementation<br />3) Design Analysis for Communication Sites or Systems<br />4) Compliance with Environmental Restrictions, Travel Restrictions, and Directives, Policies, and Handbooks Similar to Those Outlined in Section 3.0 (Applicable Documents) of the draft SOW <br />5) Travel (specifically Helicopter), Procurement, and Materials and Equipment Storage/Staging Coordination for Similar Work on Remote or Restricted Government Sites</p>
<p>Contractors must please support/substantiate the experiences and claims in their Capability Statement by providing contract information (contract numbers, dollar values, and POPs) for relevant agreements completed within the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statements must be no more than 5 pages in length, excluding the separate Market Research Questionnaire document.</p>
<p>The Capability Statement and the Market Research Questionnaire must be emailed to William Reese at William.A.Reese@cbp.dhs.gov with the subject line "AZ LMR Capability Statement" by no later than 1:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) January 6, 2014 to be considered.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
NORTH LITTLE ROCK VA MEDICAL CENTER 
COMBINED HEAT AND POWER PLANT
VA701-14-I-0167

INTRODUCTION: 

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is conducting a market survey and is seeking potential sources for the construction of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant at the North Little Rock VA Medical Center (VAMC). 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The CHP (Co-Gen) plant will consist of a 760 kW natural gas fired Microturbine with a matched alternating current (A/C) generator, generator controls; natural gas metering, power metering, data acquisition, and computer control equipment; utility interconnection equipment, including but not limited to transformers, switchgear, and protective relays; computer control software; and associated ancillary materials and equipment, site civil work, paving, concrete foundations, and building structures. Connection to the new generator will be terminated at the existing switchgear and will have anti-islanding features so that the system only operates in the presence of the utility power.

The system will have 2 primary heat loads:
1.	Share the HVAC reheat load in Building 170 with the existing boiler plant.
2.	Supply chilled water to B170 chilled water plant via a new 160 kW absorption chiller that will operate on the heat exhaust from the turbine.   
The proposed system shall be able to provide operator initiated automatic start-up and shutdown of the system, but shall also include provisions for automatic start-up and shut-down based upon other inputs such as utility power interruptions. Full system commissioning is also included to ensure the system is optimized to operate as efficiently as possible.  New electric and gas meters will be connected and integrated into the existing advanced metering systems.

The services for this project will include providing all construction related services including: providing labor, materials and equipment required to complete the project as per contract documents prepared by an independent Architect-Engineer firm.



PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:

The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed-price contract utilizing the design-bid-build approach. The anticipated solicitation will be issued as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in accordance with FAR Part 14, considering only price and the price-related factors included in the IFB. However, the results and analysis of the market research will finalize the determination of the procurement method. The type of socio-economic set-aside, in any, will depend upon the responses to this notice and any other information gathered during the market research process. 

This project is planned for advertising around April 2014. In accordance with VAAR 836.204, the magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237130 (size standard $33.5 million) applies to this procurement. The duration of the project is estimated at 365 calendar days from the issuance of a Notice to Proceed. The services for this project will include providing all construction related services including: providing labor, materials and equipment required to complete the project as per contract documents prepared by an independent Architect-Engineer firm.

<DESC>The USDA National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA, intends to award a procurement of 31 Bison heifers to Timber Ridge Bison. This animal procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106 and 6.303-2. The purchase determination is based on previous vaccine experiments that have utilized bison obtained from this source. Obtaining bison from a different source may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiences that may lead to increased variability in immune responses and impair comparison of vaccine responses across experiments. This herd has been verified free of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), a significant cause of mortality in many bison herds. Currently available diagnostics lack the sensitivity and specificity to detect infected herds or individuals. Purchase of bison with MCF would make all data from the proposed experiment invalid and non-publishable. Of equal concern would be the possibility that MCF could be inadvertently introduced into bison in other experiments (i.e. deer) at NADC; a scenario that would be devastating to several ongoing brucellosis, tuberculosis and possibly prior research projects. Least cost procurement of bison on a previous occasion did result in procurement of MCF-positive bison. This vendor maintains our bison genetic needs at an agreeable travel distance. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $40,325.00.
<p>This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide the required animals. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to lara.j.hicok@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 12:00 pm central time, December 27, 2013.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-272-9662<br />Name:		Staples, Standard, Full Strip<br />Description:	Standard chisel point staples. Full strip, 210 staples per strip, 25-sheet capacity. 1/2" W x 1/4" L. UOI is BX. BX = 5000 staples.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p><br />NSN:			7510-00-272-9662<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SWI35108; BOSSBS1914CP; UNV79000</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 8,, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The Deschutes National Forest is seeking testing of seed for R6 Bend Seed Extractory. Seed purity, viability &amp; moisture content examinations conducted for R6 Seed Extractory must be completed by AOSA (Association of Seed Analysts) certified analyst or SCST (Society of Commercial Seed Technologists) register analyst in an accredited laboratory. Examinations are completed at the time of initial seed processing and then re-tested every 3-5 years, depending on the species; as required by the WCF Seed bank regulations (FSM 2474.23) and per FSM 2470.03,3 (develop procedures &amp; arrangements with accredited seed testing laboratories to test seed for purity viability and moisture content and to supply standard laboratory reports of tests results. Currently the only site listed in both the AOSA and SCST Oregon State list is Oregon State University (ref.http://www.aosaseed.com/ or http:www.seedtechnology.net/). Historically, the OSU Seed laboratory has been conducting these exams; based on FSH 2409.26f SEED HANDBOOK; 42.1-6 which required OSU to be the examiner. The OSU Seed Laboratory have test exam results on file as far back as the initial exam for each seed lot; so these records are available to the R6 Bend Seed Extractory should something happen to our existing documents on-site. Because of the long-standing historical use of the OSU Seed Laboratory for these exams, OSU has extensive experience in performing tree seed germination exams and has equipment to do large volumes of seed lots in a short time span. They also perform both the no-chill and multiple-week pre-chill germination exams. In addition, since OSU is within the state of Oregon, it allows the R6 Seed Extractory personnel to visit and observe their services at any time. To keep records consistent with previous seed lots exams following the viability of the seed in long-term storage, the Seed handbook requirements of using OSU Seed Laboratory and the fact they are the only AOSA accredited seed laboratory in the state of Oregon, only OSU can perform these tests. Therefore the Government intends to award a contract for this requirement to OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY, KERR ADMINISTRATION B306, CORVALLIS OREGON 977331 This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all interested parties who believe they may meet these requirements may submit in writing, within 10 calendar days of this notification, complete information describing the ability to meet these requirements. Information will be used solely for purposes of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time. All responses to this announcement must be directed to Maria Gonzalez <a href="mailto:mgonzalez@fs.fed.us">mgonzalez@fs.fed.us</a>&nbsp;not later than <strong>12 noon</strong>, Pacific Standard Time, January 3, 2014.

<DESC>The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) has revised the size standards for 13 industries in NAICS Sector 22, Utilities.  Specifically, SBA
<p>&bull;	increased receipts based size standards for three industries;</p>
<p>&bull;	changed the basis for measuring business size from megawatt hours to number of employees for the 10 electric power generation, transmission, and distribution industries; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	removed Footnote 1 from SBA's Table of Size Standards that applied to all of the NAICS codes in electric power generation, transmission, and distribution.</p>
<p>Before its removal, the footnote stated that a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours.  This requirement no longer applies.</p>
<p>SBA is retaining the current size standards for the remaining industries in Sector 22.  As part of its ongoing comprehensive size standards review, SBA evaluated all size standards for industries in NAICS Sector 22 to determine whether they should be retained or revised.</p>
<p>Approximately 400 additional firms will be small under the new size standards and eligible for SBA's loan and Federal procurement programs.</p>
<p>You may read/download SBA's final rule at www.regulations.gov (search on "RIN 3245-AG25" [without quotes]).<br />You may also review the originally proposed rule together with all of the comments submitted by going to www.regulations.gov.  The proposed rule and the comments are included in the same docket.</p>
<p>The revised size standards are effective January 22, 2014.</p>

<DESC>The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) has revised size standards for two industries in NAICS Sector 23, Construction, and retained current standards for the remaining 30 industries in that Sector.  Specifically, SBA
<p>&bull;	increased the size standard for NAICS 237210, Land Subdivision, from $7 million in average annual receipts to $25.5 million; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	increased the size standard for Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities from $20 million to $25.5 million, the size standard for which is an "exception" under NAICS 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.</p>
<p>The SBA had proposed to eliminate Footnote 2 from its table of size standards.  Footnote 2 states that to be considered small for purposes of Government procurement, a firm must perform at least 40 percent of the volume dredged with its own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging concern.  However, based on the comments the Agency received to the proposed rule, it is making no change to the footnote.</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing comprehensive size standards review, SBA evaluated all size standards for industries in NAICS Sector 23 to determine whether they should be retained or revised.</p>

<RESPDATE>010214
<CONTACT>William P. Jackson, Contract Specialist, Phone 2026934595, Email jackson.william.p@dol.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Human Resources (HRC), in Washington DC, intends to award a Purchase Order to Economic Systems, Inc (ESI), of Falls Church, VA, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; justification rationale is 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The purpose of this purchase order is to acquire access, for a base-year and four 1-year option periods, for the most basic functionality of FHR Navigator. <br /><br />NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.<br /><br />It has been determined that ESI is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement, based on the reasoning outlined below:</p>
<p>While there may be other vehicles to compute retirement estimates, market research has shown that they do not offer the unique and innovative capabilities of FHR Navigator (Economic Systems, Inc.). At this time, the other vehicles do not offer a FERCCA calculator that does a side-by-side comparison of two retirement systems which is a critical functionality for DOL. FHR Navigator is the only tool that provides a comparison FERCCA Benefits statement at this time.</p>
<p>DOL currently has approximately 35 FERCCA cases pending. This number goes up and down as cases are completed and new errors are discovered. Errors are identified by Human Resources Assistants and Specialists when a review of creditable prior service and retirement coverage is completed for new employees transferring to the department or a reinstatement, and when employees' request retirement estimates or submit a retirement application. Providing employees with accurate information/calculations is a must to assist the employee in making this decision, which will affect their future retirement.</p>
<p>FHR Navigator's sophisticated and innovative products demonstrate a unique and innovative capability to provide all of the services that DOL needs. There is no other all-in-one product available to the government today, as other vendors don't offer a financial education package including financial planning calculators and tools. DOL is in need of this feature which is important to the success and expansion of our financial education program in providing financial education to each DOL employee regardless of where he/she may be geographically. In addition, other vendors services does not include case tracking or electronic signatures. OPM is actively working on the ability to accept retirement forms that are sent electronically and signed electronically so this functionality is also critical for the Department.</p>

Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting DOL's requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, may be considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for an 502 Contracting Squadron, JBSA-Lackland, Texas, requirement for Hewlett-Packard hardware/software warranty and support services. The successful contractor will ensure that all listed equipment/systems (Attached Item List) are covered directly with an HP warranty from HP.&nbsp; <strong>Third party warranties will not be accepted</strong>.&nbsp;All items are currently up and running. SAID(s) associated with this requirement are 103611575737 and 103832803970. The previous contract, FA8771-04-D-0004-ZVE5 was awarded to Northrop Grumman for one year in the amount of $52,029.72. Previous HP coverage expired on 01 October 2013, and this equipment is not currently covered. Any required reinstatement fees must be included in the offeror's price on the bid schedule. The attached bid schedule <strong>must</strong> be filled out clearly and returned to the author of this solicitation. Contractors are encouraged to submit additional breakdowns of their pricing for reference, however it will be the overall pricing listed on the attached bid schedule that will be used for evaluation purposes.
<p><strong>Best Value Determination</strong>: The technically acceptable, lowest priced quote will be determined to represent the best value. An offer is considered technically acceptable if it includes two items: 1) Pricing is clearly provided as requested on the attached bid schedule, and 2) Verification of an offeror's ability to provide an HP equipment warranty directly from HP, i.e. HP Authorized Reseller License. If the lowest priced submission does not meet this criteria, the Government reserves the right to evaluate the next lowest priced submissions until it has determined a technically acceptable submission. The evaluation will stop at the point when the Government determines an offeror to be technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price, because that offer will represent the best value. Award will be made to the responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among technically acceptable quotes.</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period is from the date of award, on or around 06 January 2014, through 30 September 2014. The start date of 06 January 2014 is estimated, and may vary by a week in either direction.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a total set-aside for small business concerns. Only quotes submitted by small business concerns will be accepted by the Government. Any quote that is submitted by a contractor that is not a small business concern will not be considered for award. The North American Standard Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this acquisition is 541511 with an associated small business dollar size standard of $25.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible and potential small business offerors may submit proposals in response to this solicitation, and all submissions will be considered. All offerors must be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at www.sam.gov, the On-Line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) website at www.sam.gov and have a tax identification number and a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.</p>
<p>The following FAR clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation: 52.219-13 Notice of Set-Aside of Orders (NOV 2011), 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (NOV 2011), and 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (NOV 2011), in addition to many other standard commercial clauses that shall be presented to the apparent successful offeror prior to contract award.</p>
<p>Vendors shall submit responses to all of the following:</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Architectural and Engineering Services<br /></strong><br />FEMA seeks to continue to leverage the successes of Risk MAP, HMTAP, TARC and their predecessor programs to further enhance the usability and value of natural hazard risk information, leading to communities taking mitigative actions to reduce the risk to life and property, and increase resilience so they may withstand, adapt, and recover from disasters. This suite of A&amp;E services will be referred to as Production and Technical Services (PTS) throughout this and other documents. The scope of services to be delivered is detailed below. The PTS require the continuous review and improvement of existing processes and tools as the environmental, technological, and political considerations impacting the programs continue to evolve.</p>
<p>This solicitation is to obtain new contracts which will replace the current suite of Architecture and Engineering (A&amp;E) contracts which expire in March, 2014 for Risk Map, September, 2014 for HMTAP, and May, 2015 for TARC respectively. By including the A&amp;E portions of HMTAP and TARC into this Risk MAP solicitation, FEMA is seeking to promote integration, innovation, and efficiencies into the Program.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that two or more Offerors will be selected to enter into IDIQ contracts with FEMA for PTS work for all Regions to include Headquarters. Those Offerors may compete for various projects and tasks as they may arise during the life of the contract. Because the scope and number of projects and tasks are unknown at the time of contract execution, the IDIQ contract vehicle will be used. The term of the IDIQ contracts for these projects will be for 5 years. The period of performance may be extended beyond 5 years or 60 months in accordance with FAR clause 52.217-8 (see section I.8). A map of the regions is included in this Solicitation/Synopsis as Attachment B.</p>
<p>This Solicitation is the means for prospective Service Providers to submit their qualifications for the IDIQ services for PTS.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>This is not a competitive solicitation.  A proposal is being solicited on a sole source basis from the company identified below for two different efforts; the KC-130J Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT) and the KC-130J Weapon Systems Trainer (WST), Device 2F199-4.
On 09 January 2013, the Government provided notice for a contract action it intended to solicit and negotiate under a TSC III order for the KC-130J CPT. The notification also served to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.204. Considering market research for the KC-130 CPT, the Governments knowledge of the requirement and industry, and the lack of adequate responses to the presolicitation notice provided on 09 January 2013, a Justification pursuant to FAR 6.303-1 is being redacted and identifies the authority for the sole source contract as FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This justification identifies Lockheed Martin Corporation, Cage Code 16331 as the only responsible source.
  Pursuant to FAR 6.305, a redacted copy of the justification for other than full and open competition will be made available to the GPE within 14 days after contract award.

The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing (except for assorted hourly rates), as projects within this dollar range could have significant variances in unit price values based on the size of the individual project. Rather, each project will be competed among the awardees of the IDIQ contract using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone, or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. All awardees under the IDIQ contract will be presented with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. It is anticipated that no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts will be awarded under this solicitation, although the government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside this range.</span></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS estimates. <br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

This procurement will result in multiple awards for projects within these parameters at all locations, owned and leased, within the jurisdiction of the GSA West Virginia Office. Using this IDIQ vehicle, ordering officials will place individual task orders utilizing competitive procedures among all vendors awarded contracts through this procurement.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The term of the contracts will be for a one (1) year base with four (4) one (1) year options. The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing (except for assorted hourly rates), as projects within this dollar range could have significant variances in unit price values based on the size of the individual project. Rather, each project will be competed among the awardees of the IDIQ contract using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone, or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. All awardees under the IDIQ contract will be presented with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. It is anticipated that no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts will be awarded under this solicitation, although the government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside this range.</span></p>

The individual orders to be placed under the contracts will range from the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000.00) up to the prospectus limit (currently $2.79 million). Task orders may also be placed outside this dollar range if it is in the best interest of the government to do so; however, awardees have the option to decline any RFP's in this case. Utilizing a multiple award IDIQ will maximize competition, as all awardees will compete for each task order, resulting in favorable competitive pricing for GSA.</span></p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>Request for Information on Bi-Static Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Sensor Systems for Cavity Detection   <br>      <br>   The U.S Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of the US Technical Support Working Group (TSWG), is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for the state-of-the-art technology, within industry, in the area of Bi-Static Frequency Domain EM systems to identify the position, extent and depth of underground resistors (cavities or voids).  The TSWG is seeking sources interested in providing information and subject matter expertise on how to build, integrate, and deliver a state-of-the-art Bi-Static Frequency Domain EM (BSFDEM) sensor system that can identify the position, extent and depth of subsurface cavities and other resistive subsurface targets of interest.  The goal is to provide a BSFDEM that can identify the position, extent and depth of cavities with both high probability of detection and localization accuracy that is able to be transported, assembled, operated and disassembled by a two man team with all operators and components transported in a single vehicle.    <br>      <br>   The BSFDEM sensor system is composed of a magnetic field transmitter (TX), magnetic field sensors (RX), a highly accurate GPS unit (or units) and a processing unit. The Bi-Static system should include a transmitter that will be located at some distance from the void location. The transmitted field will interact with subsurface materials, both conductive and resistive, causing perturbations in the magnetic field(s) measured by the multiple magnetic field sensors. The processing unit should communicate with the magnetic field sensors and the GPS unit(s) to digitize and record the magnetic field data from the sensors and combine this data with the GPS location information.   <br>      <br>   The system should be composed primarily of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to facilitate ease of obtaining parts and repair in austere locations supported primarily by local commercial vendors.     <br>      <br>   The estimated performance of the transmitter (TX), receiver sensing system (RX) and GPS are detailed in the following paragraphs. Responders are encouraged to review and propose changes in the proposed design in order to achieve performances that exceed those definitions of the system. System size, weight, power, cost, reliability and ease of operation are major factors that will be reviewed.    <br>      <br>   The transmitter (TX) should be able to emit continuous waveforms in the range 1 kHz to 1000 kHz in increments of no more than 50 kHz.  Multiple waveforms/frequencies simultaneously would be preferred.  The TX output should be adjustable and have a magnetic moment of at least 10 Amp meters (A?m); however, the TX power cannot be so strong as to interfere with FCC (or location equivalent) transmission restrictions.  The TX needs to be reasonably portable, requiring no more than two individuals to position and set up.  TX power supply must be portable (e.g., rechargeable battery).   <br>      <br>   The receiver (RX) component should be capable of sensing continuous waveforms in the range 1 kHz to 1000 kHz.  Multiple waveforms/frequencies simultaneously would be preferred.  24-bit A/D resolution is required.  The RX component must be lightweight (less than 25 lbs) such that it is man-portable with the potential option to vehicle-mount or tow the RX.  Power supply should be integrated into sensor.   <br>      <br>   System setup time should be less than 0.5 hours and any subsequent system calibration or configuration changes should take no more than 10-15 minutes.  The system should be able to be transported to/from a survey site by a passenger vehicle (e.g., van).  The system is required to yield a sensitivity of 10 femtotesla (fT) or better with a noise level of approximately 1 fT/Hz1/2.  Output of the system must be at a minimum of 10 Hz and reflect the least amount of signal processing necessary.  EM data should be geotagged with GPS position data having accuracy better than 20 cm.  Raw data storage should be internal to the system (hard memory, solid state drive). Access to the data should be easy and simple (e.g. USB port, SD card, etc.). Redundant data storage would be preferred with the raw data being stored to more than one on board storage location or sent to another storage device wirelessly. During operation the user should be provided system health messages onscreen (e.g. battery life, proper data storage, GPS operational, etc.) During operation the user should be provided real-time data onscreen.  The system must be able to run continuously for a minimum of 2 hours and function in extreme weather, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.     <br>      <br>   Sensors must be software controllable through the processing unit with an integrated Graphical User Interface (GUI).     <br>      <br>   Government purpose rights for all source and compiled code is encouraged (and may be required) as part of any system.   <br>      <br>   Responses to this RFI must be unclassified. Responses should be submitted no later than 1700 hours on 06 January 2014.    <br>      <br>   Electronic responses are to be in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format using a size 12 font with one inch margins.  Adobe PDF format is preferred.  Responses should include a cover letter and at a minimum, provide the following:   <br>      <br>       1. A cover letter (optional)   <br>   2. A cover page labeled with the heading  BSFDEM for Cavity Detection, name of company, name of corporate point of contact (POC), name of technical POC, telephone number for each POC, full mailing address, e-mail addresses for each POC, CAGE Code, and any other pertinent information.    <br>   3. No more than fifteen pages of technical information including:   <br>   (a) Component and system technical descriptions, system block diagram and estimated performance   <br>   (b) Narrative describing how the specified technical requirements would be addressed and fulfilled   <br>   (c) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to development and modification of commercial systems including relevant history of ability to develop and integrate similar technologies   <br>   (d) Rough estimate of costs and timeline   <br>   (e) An indication as to whether the technology is sufficiently mature to build and demonstrate, or whether additional development would be more appropriate prior to a subsequent build. Prefer technology solutions with readiness levels that can support production and fielding within the next two years.   <br>   (f) Describe any Independent Research and Development (IRAD) programs applicable to this RFI regarding government modified commercial systems for applications such as this.   <br>   (g) changes in the proposed design to achieve performances that exceed definitions of the system     <br>   4. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the Response.   <br>      <br>   Please submit all pages as a single (.doc or .pdf) file.  Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.   <br>      <br>   This request for information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a separate solicitation notice will be published.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.    <br>      <br>   All responsible, interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification data along with any questions no later than 06 January 2014 to the following: U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey(ACC-NJ), ATTN: Kristen Kachur, ACC-NJ-ET, Building 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>The Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), and the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) intend to conduct an Instrumented Department of Army (DA) Directed Evaluation on available Soldier Radio Waveform - Appliques (SRW-A) during Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 14-2.  The objective of this evaluation is to obtain sufficient data to determine if SRW-A can satisfy the vehicular mounted, near-term networking capability with a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) waveform as identified in the Rifleman Radio Capability Production Document (CPD) and the JTRS Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) CPD.  Satisfactory demonstration of this capability will support the requisite Material Release(s) for product fielding and may lead to an SRW-A fielding solution for Capability Set 15 (CS-15) and other DOD and Government requirements.      <br>    <br>  The strategic goals for this operational evaluation are to document the performance baseline of the various SRW-A radios with regard to:   <br>    <br>      i.	Network management  <br>     ii.	Interoperability considerations  <br>    iii.	Equipment capabilities to include ease of use  <br>    <br>  Prior to participating in NIE 14-2 the SRW-A must:   <br>    <br>  1)  Have a minimum of one SRW capable channel.   <br>    <br>  2)  Have the ability to be endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect user voice and data to the SECRET level in time to participate in NIE 14.2.   <br>    <br>  3)  Have the ability to obtain a Safety Release in time to participate in NIE 14.2.   <br>    <br>  4)  Have the ability to obtain Spectrum Certification (DD Form 1494) in time to participate in NIE 14.2.  <br>    <br>  5)  Have the ability to obtain Interim Authority to Test (IATT) in time to participate in NIE 14.2.   <br>    <br>  6)  Have the ability to provide as Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) approximately 25 each SRW-A to NIE 14.2 by 7 FEB 2014.  Five of these SRW-A are to be provided to the LBRR as soon as possible, and five of the SRW-A installation kits are to be provided for installation build by 10 JAN 2014.    <br>    <br>  7)  Have the ability to complete the PM provided NIE Request for Information (RFI) package by 15 JAN 2014 (package will be provided by PM upon request).  <br>    <br>  8)  Have the ability to provide Field Service Support during NIE 14.2 preparation (to include LBRR, instrumentation development, Golden Vehicle Build, data products build, etc.) without the expectation of reimbursement by the Government.  As a minimum, a dedicated on-site Field Service Representative (FSR) would be expected during the NIE event from 15 FEB 2014 through 31 MAY 2014, as well as to provide engineering support for the CFE during all field preparation.      <br>    <br>  NIE 14-2 is a time driven event and will occur regardless of the SRW-A test readiness.  The Government will make every attempt to conduct the Instrumented DA Directed Evaluation on all SRW-A variants which meet the eight NIE prerequisites listed above.  However, Test Readiness Reviews (TRR) will be conducted on each SRW-A.  Each SRW-A will gain entrance or be denied entrance into the SRW-A Directed Evaluation based on that product lines' TRR.   <br>    <br>  All costs for both outbound and return shipment of the CFE will be at the participant's expense.  Arrangements for return shipment of the CFE will be made as soon as possible after completion of the NIE 14-2.  <br>    <br>  PM TR NIE POC for this action is Ms. Flora Marshall, flora.m.marshal.civ@mail.mil, (443) 395-1124.   <br>    <br>  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  <br>    <br>  Only UNCLASSIFIED information shall be included in any response.  <br>      <br>  Proprietary or business sensitive information provided in response to this announcement shall be marked appropriately, and it will not be disclosed outside the Government or its support contractors.  <br>    <br>  Companies interested in having their SRW-A evaluated during NIE 14-2 must notify the undersigned of their interest within two weeks of this notice. <br>  <br> CHANGE 1 - 23 DEC 2013 - The e-mail address for Ms. Marshall is corrected to: flora.m.marshall.civ@mail.mil.   <br>  <br> All other content of the announcement is unchanged.  Due to the e-mail error in the original posting, industry respondents are requested to re-submit any previous messages intended for Ms. Marshall to ensure their receipt.

<DESC>Correction - This action was originally publicized on 04 Nov 2013 in the Fed Biz Ops.  The purpose of this modification is to add Defense Exportability Features (DEF) options for the Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM) Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort.  The period of performance for the Base Effort and ten (10) options originally synopsized are updated to include the DEF options, to change the acquisition strategy to limited source competition, change Technical POCs, and revise email addresses for all POCs.  All other information publicized in the original synopsis is unchanged. <br>  <br> Fourteen (14) options may be exercised if determined to be in the best interest of the Government, including: aircraft integration for follow-on army and other service platforms, A-Kit engineering and test support, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), procurement of Technical Data Package (TDP), NAVY Information Assurance (IA), NAVY B-Kit EMD development, and Classified Rotary Wing Defense Exportability Features (DEF) requirements.  The first follow-on aircraft for integration will be the AH-64E.  The Government does not guarantee the exercise of any option within the RFP or any resultant contract.  If some or all of the Contract Options 1-14 are exercised, the period of performance may be extended by thirty-four (34) months.   <br>  <br> The Government intends to release a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the CIRCM EMD effort.  To be eligible for contract award, offerors must have completed a successful Preliminary Design Review (PDR), demonstrating the CIRCM System Performance Requirements.  The PDR must be held before, at a minimum, an authority delegated by a Component Acquisition Executive.  The offeror must also provide a design which has attained Technology Readiness Level of at least 6, as determined by an independent review team and properly certified by, at a minimum, a Component Acquisition Executive delegated authority (e.g. DASA R&T for the Army).  The only two known sources that meet the aforementioned criteria for participation in the limited source competition are:  BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integrations, 65 Spit Brook Road, Nashua, NH 03060 (CAGE 94117) and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation,  Electronic Systems, Land and Self Protection Systems Division, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008 (CAGE: 26916).  All other identified responsible sources that meet the eligibility criteria stated above who submit a proposal shall be considered by this agency.  The Government will not award a contract on the basis of the DRAFT RFP and no proposals will be accepted at this time.  The Draft RFP shall be provided to any requesting potential offeror, and the Government will accept and respond to comments or questions regarding the DRAFT RFP.  It is anticipated that this EMD effort will be awarded to a single contractor utilizing limited competition. <br>  <br> Security Classification Guidance should be directed to PM ASE, Mr. Ed Jernigan at (256) 842-7850, edward.m.jernigan.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> Contracting POCs are:  <br> Ms. Eddie Whitfield (256) 955-6299, eddie.m.whitfield.civ@mail.mil <br> Ms. Heather Stiles (256) 842-8084, heather.t.stiles.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Technical POCs are: <br> Mr. Jason Matheney at (256) 842-4251, jason.l.matheney.civ@mail.mil <br> Mr. Clint Spratley at (256) 842-3344, clinton.e.spratley.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>     <br>    <br>

All capability statements shall be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: jodi.gordon@emcbc.doe.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Friday, January 3, 2014. <br /><br />2) All interested parties are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than fifteen pages (specific to company or team capabilities) plus an additional five pages to discuss potential acquisition strategy alternatives as requested in questions 1-3 of the RFI (division and/or aggregation of scope element(s) or potential contracting alternatives; challenges and risks; fixed price contract structure; etc.). The total capability statement submitted should therefore be no more than a total of 20 pages, including no smaller than 12 point font. <br /><br />3) Provide information&nbsp;about the current technical difficulties with the EMCBC procurement website.<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. No solicitation is available. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry. <br /><br />The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is currently in the acquisition planning phase for potential upcoming EM procurement(s) at the Idaho Site post Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Since its inception in 1949, the Idaho Site has fulfilled numerous DOE missions including designing and testing nuclear reactors; reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recover fissile materials; managing spent nuclear fuel; and storing, treating and disposing of various waste streams. Currently, the Office of EM acts in the role of tenant on the site, while the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE) serves as the landlord. The mission of the Office of EM is to complete the safe cleanup of the environmental legacy brought about from five decades of nuclear weapons development and government-sponsored nuclear energy research. <br /><br />In May 2002, the DOE, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency signed a letter of intent formalizing an agreement to pursue accelerated risk reduction and cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to achieve the following vision: "By 2012, the INL will have achieved significant risk reduction and will have placed materials in safe storage ready for disposal." While this goal has been achieved, there are still risk reduction and mission critical environmental management activities that need to be completed. <br /><br />As previously announced, the DOE plans to conduct an Industry Day on Wednesday, December 4, 2013, in support of the upcoming EM procurement(s) at the Idaho Site post FY 2015. Details of this previous announcement were posted on November 15, 2013 as a Special Notice to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=feb19fc17e2864d408e8f4a9a34f38f3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0 The DOE EM Consolidated Business Center (CBC) also created a procurement website where additional information will be provided which may be viewed here (as referenced on FBO):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/SEB/IDAHO%20SITE%20POST%20FY%202015/">http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/SEB/IDAHO%20SITE%20POST%20FY%202015/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>*Please note that the DOE EMCBC's procurement website that was created to post additional information associated with the <em>Idaho Site Post FY 2015 Environmental Management (EM) Mission Work</em> is currently having technical difficulties.&nbsp; The EMCBC is diligently working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and anticipates that the site will be fully functional by Monday evening, December 16, 2013. &nbsp;Please continue to monitor the EMCBC procurement website for additional information.</strong></span></p>
The purpose of this RFI is to solicit interested parties' input with the specialized capabilities necessary to meet all or part of the requirements of the Elements of Scope for efforts at the Idaho Site post FY 2015. Information provided at the Industry Day and on the EMCBC website is provided for industry's assistance in preparation of Contractors' capability statements. The information on the EMCBC website will be updated as it becomes available; therefore, Contractors should monitor the EMCBC website for additional information. Within these capability statements, DOE is seeking feedback from contractors and other interested parties regarding options for innovative approaches for the performance of scope elements as well as insight into potential contracting alternatives to achieve the EM goals at the Idaho site post FY 2015. <br /><br />Due to the preliminary stage of this planning activity, there is no Performance Work Statement available at this time. The anticipated number of procurement(s), types of contract(s), periods of performance, amount of funding, or set aside possibilities are to be determined. The contemplated procurement(s) will incorporate remaining EM work scope following completion of the current Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) and the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) contracts. The major Elements of Scope include, but are not limited to: <br /><br />- Spent Nuclear Fuel <br />- Solid Waste Management <br />- Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&amp;D) <br />- Environmental Activities <br />- Site Infrastructure (EM Areas only) <br />- Calcine Disposition Project<br /><br />DOE is also seeking interested parties with specialized capabilities necessary to successfully perform all or a portion of the Elements of Scope defined above to further determine whether or not all or a portion of the work can be set-aside for small businesses, 8(a), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB), women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. <br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT.<br /><br />Capability Statements should include the following information as appropriate and applicable: <br /><br />1.) Describe your ability and approach to meeting all or a portion of the requirements for the specific Elements of Scope, including innovative approaches for the division or aggregation of scope elements as well as insight into contracting alternatives (number of procurement(s), types of contract(s), periods of performance, set aside possibilities, etc.) to achieve the EM goals at the Idaho site post FY 2015. <br /><br />2.) Identify any performance challenges and risks in meeting the requirements discussed in the Elements of Scope.

Also identify how a specific division and/or aggregation of scope element(s) or potential contracting alternatives could be utilized to minimize such risks. <br /><br />3.) Identify potential areas within any Element of Scope that may be appropriate for a fixed price contract structure along with any associated pricing challenges and risks. Provide specific feedback for type of information required from DOE to support development of a fixed price proposal for any Elements of Scope. <br /><br />4.)

The total capability statement submitted should therefore be no more than a total of 20 pages, including no smaller than 12 point font. The Government will evaluate each capability statement based on the interested party's demonstrated qualifications, capabilities, expertise, experience and past performance in each of the scope areas specified to their area of expertise. <br /><br />All Interested parties are requested to provide their name of firm, point of contact, phone number, address of firm, CAGE Code, and/or a DUNS Number. <br /><br />DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation. An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response. However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked, and sufficient justification provided as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this Special Notice amendment is to:<br />a) Correct the reference to Genomics, incorrectly stated in the prior Special Notice version as Genetics; <br />b) Provide Draft BAA Pre-Proposal Conference Documents for Industry review prior to the Pre-Proposal Conference; and<br />c) Provide revised information about the Pre-Proposal Conference (see full text below).</p>
<p><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to host an on-line Pre-Proposal Conference for the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots project prior to release of the formal Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation. The on-line Pre-Proposal Conference is scheduled to be held January 6, 2014, from 1:00PM to 3:30 PM local time. The formal BAA is scheduled for release on or about January 13, 2014.</p>
<p>The Pre-Proposal Conference will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.201. The goal of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements. The NCI's intent of the Pre-Proposal Conference is to assist all potential offerors in the development of comprehensive, quality responses to the anticipated BAA. As such, the Pre-Proposal Conference will: 1) familiarize participants with NCI's Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots requirements; 2) review BAA proposal requirements; 3) identify potential offerors in order to promote collaboration and facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships; and 4) address questions prior to potential offerors' proposal development for this complex requirement. Attendance at this Pre-Proposal Conference is via on-line only; there is no physical location to attend. All responsible sources may participate in this online conference. The Pre-Proposal Conference is for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>Draft BAA Pre-Proposal Conference documents are attached for review and comment prior to the Pre-Proposal Conference. These documents reflect the NCI's best estimate of the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots project; however, changes may occur. All comments or questions regarding the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots project must be submitted by email with a subject line of, "FAQ" to <a href="mailto:ncicloud@mail.nih.gov">ncicloud@mail.nih.gov</a>. Submission of comments or questions by any other means may not be reviewed. The formal BAA will be posted after the Pre-Proposal Conference reflecting the latest information which shall supersede all prior documents.</p>
<p>The Government intends to post the on-line Pre-Proposal Conference logistics to <a href="http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots">http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots</a>&nbsp;in advance of the event. Please check this site frequently as the information may be updated prior to the on-line event. No advance registration is required and all responsible sources may attend. In order for questions to be expeditiously addressed during the on-line Pre-Proposal Conference, potential offerors are requested to submit written questions via email with a subject line of, "FAQ" to <a href="mailto:ncicloud@mail.nih.gov">ncicloud@mail.nih.gov</a>&nbsp;in advance of the Pre-Proposal Conference on January 6, 2014. Potential offerors may also have the opportunity to ask questions or seek clarifications during the meeting, subject to technical limitations of the on-line venue, if any. Due to logistical and time considerations not all questions may be answered during the Pre-Proposal Conference; however, all questions received will be addressed post-conference via the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page along with a list of attendees. <a href="http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots">http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots</a>.</p>
<p>Any statements or representations made during the on-line Pre-Proposal Conference are not binding. Potential offerors are cautioned that the ONLY controlling document for this acquisition is the formal BAA and any subsequent amendments.</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Federal Communications Commission<br />Office of the Managing Director</p>
<p><br />1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Office of the Managing Director (OMD), in support of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is seeking information on the design, build, operation and maintenance (to include ongoing improvement) of a Video Access Technology Reference Platform (VATR) to facilitate the provision of Video Relay Service (VRS), Internet Protocol Relay Service (IP Relay), and Internet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service (IP CTS). Specifically, the OMD wants to identify sources that can do the work. Additionally, we seek industry's input into the feasibility of the planned scope of work, as well as, a rough order of magnitude as it relates to cost and schedule.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services whatsoever. Further, the FCC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept or review unsolicited proposals. Vendors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if and / or when any are issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Please note that current certified TRS providers, current employees of TRS providers, and companies that staff current employees of TRS providers should not respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 The FCC, as set forth in Structure and Practices of the Video Relay Service Program, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to-Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket Nos. 10-51, 03-123, 28 FCC Rcd 8618 (2013) (VRS Reform Order), is seeking information to aid in the development of a solicitation for the creation and ongoing administration, as described herein, of the VATR platform using open source or off-the-shelf technology to the maximum extent practical.</p>
<p>2.2 Planned Production: It is the intent of the FCC to have a VATR in testing no later than (NLT) 3 months after contract award and a fully operational VATR within 6 months of contract award.</p>
<p>2.3 Security Requirements: The VATR must maintain Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance, as well as sufficient safeguards to maintain the proprietary or personal nature of the information in its possession and shall protect such information from theft, loss, or misuse (where those aren't already covered by FISMA or the Privacy Act of 1964).</p>
<p><br />3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>3.1 As stated in 1.1. above, the OMD wants to contract for a VATR that can be used to make and receive VRS, IP Relay, and IP CTS calls, as well as "point-to-point" calls directly between Internet-based TRS users. The OMD is also considering whether the VATR should be built on open source hardware and/or software and whether commercial or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, technology, or services are suitable. The VATR is to be an application based system that is interoperable with existing certified VRS provider platforms, but that provides a quality of service that at a minimum is on par with the "best platforms" on the market. The OMD is seeking input into the following:</p>
<p>3.1.1 How would the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Open Source solutions impact the cost to build and operate or the overall quality of the platform? Please elaborate.</p>
<p>3.1.2 If the FCC were to take ownership of the rights to any solution offered to fulfill this contract, what would be the impact to: 1) your desire to bid, or 2) the cost of your bid?</p>
<p>3.1.3 Which of the following options for building the VATR platform appear to you as most likely to ensure successful completion:<br />(1) Your company provides a ready-to-run system?<br />(2) Your company works with a value-added reseller or a subcontractor to integrate the system and provide the VRS-specific features?<br />(3) Your company provides hardware and/or software components that are then integrated and enhanced by a third party as a separate FCC contract?</p>
<p>3.1.5 What are the technical considerations/challenges the FCC should be consider when developing the requirements for the VATR?</p>
<p>3.1.6 Should the VATR conduct validation of a user's eligibility and geographic location (a) directly with the iTRS-URD or (b) via the NCP?</p>
<p>3.1.7 The Commission seeks to understand the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of the cost and schedule for 1) development of the platform and 2) the annual cost for tech support plus periodic updates/upgrades to this platform.</p>
<p>3.1.8 What your recommended approach to updating and/or modifying the VATR as standards and regulations evolve if the goal is to maintain a leading edge system for providing VRS? What is your annual ROM for the effort?</p>
<p>3.2 Finally, what else should the Commission consider pertaining to this acquisition?</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2000 compatible format are due no later than&nbsp;6 January 2014, 9:00AM EST.

<p>5.0 Industry Discussions</p>

<p>3.1.1 How would the use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Open Source solutions impact the cost to build and operate or the overall quality of the platform? Please elaborate.</p>
<p>3.1.2 If the FCC were to take ownership of the rights to any solution offered to fulfill this possible requirement, what would be the impact to 1) Your desire to bid, or 2) The cost of your solution?</p>
<p>3.1.3 Is it reasonable to assume that a single company can both build and operate the system? If not, how can the FCC ensure direct access to the developers in the development phase and the operators during the operations phase, when two or more companies are filling those roles, without having to go through one company to get to the other?</p>
<p>3.1.4 Which of the following options for building the NCP appear to you as most likely to ensure successful completion:<br />(1) Your company provides a ready-to-run system?<br />(2) Your company works with a value-added reseller or a subcontractor to integrate the system and provide the VRS-specific features?<br />(3) Your company provides hardware and/or software components that are then integrated and enhanced by a third party as a separate FCC contract?</p>
<p>3.1.5 What are the technical considerations/challenges the FCC should be considering when developing the requirements for the system?</p>
<p>3.1.6 Should the verification and validation of a user's eligibility and geographic location occur within: a) this platform or b) within the iTRS User Registration Database (iTRS-UDR)? <br />3.1.6.1 Additionally, should it occur on a per call basis or only upon initiation of the VATR platform?<br />3.1.6.2 Finally, if the verification and validation occurs within the iTRS-URD or is split between the iTRS-URD and the NCP; should the VATRP talk directly to the iTRS-URD or should it route through the NCP?</p>
<p>3.1.7 The Commission envisions technical support for stand-alone Call Assistance (CA) providers and other VRS providers through a 24x7 network operations center (NOC) that can be reached by phone, email, and a trouble ticket system for service outages; as well as technical support, including a ticketing system, for issues of a lesser impact and urgency, such as interoperability or performance problems. Would your recommended solution for providing technical support, align with the description above, or do you recommend a different approach? What would you recommend for VRS end users?</p>
<p>3.1.8 How would you propose to implement the appropriate processing of emergency calls, specifically, the functionality necessary to comply with 47 C.F.R &sect; 64.605(b)?</p>
<p>3.1.9 The Commission seeks to understand the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of the cost and schedule for the development of the platform, as well as the annual cost for operating and maintaining this platform.</p>
<p>3.1.10 What your recommended approach to updating and/or modifying the VATR as standards and regulations evolve if the goal is to maintain a leading edge system for providing VRS? What is your annual ROM for the effort?</p>

<DESC>Security cooperation (SC) is defined by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the means by which the DoD encourages and enables countries and organizations to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives.  The SC operations of all DoD  organizations support the objectives outlined in the National Security Strategy of the United States, the National Defense Strategy, and the National Military Strategy. SC objectives are carried out as a part of the theater strategy planning and execution function of multiple DoD agencies. Currently, each DoD Agency has an individual method by which theater security cooperation (TSC) data is collected and accessed. The G-TSCMIS effort will make global TSC data more accessible to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Joint Staff, as well as available to the TSC community at large. The G- TSCMIS will entail the standardization of TSC data, single point aggregation and visualization of that data, and data linkages to enable assessment of the data against strategic objectives of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<a href="mailto:raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The NAICS code for this work is 237990 for dredging. <br> The New England District is acquiring an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Remedial Action Contract to support the District's work for United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in the execution of the Superfund cleanup of New Bedford Harbor.    <br>    <br>  The Request for Proposal will be solicited under full and open competition and unrestricted to business size; per FAR subpart 19.704 all large businesses will be required to submit a small business sub-contracting plan. The Total Acquisition Value (TAV) of the contract awarded under this solicitation will not exceed $350M and will have a 10-year ordering period with a 3-year base period, two 2-year option periods and three 1-year option periods. The work will be performed primarily at the New Bedford Harbor site, although the contract will allow for work at other sites requiring these services within the mission areas of the North Atlantic Division. The awarded contract will include cost reimbursable task orders. This will be a performance-based procurement. Specific outcomes will be defined in each negotiated task order. Task orders will be awarded up to the maximum capacity of $350,000,000.00. There is no limit of the number of Task Order(s) that may be executed, but in no case shall the sum of all Task Order(s) executed exceed $350,000,000.00. The Government is obligated to satisfy a minimum guaranteed amount of not less than $200,000.00 over the base period of the contract.  <br>    <br>  The primary work involves dredging, de-sanding dewatering, and disposal of sediments contaminated with PCBs. Other requirements include the operation of a water treatment facility, technical support including evaluations, cost analysis, studies, investigations, and other remedial actions as necessary. The remedial action at the New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site (NBHSS) is expected to take less than 10 years to complete based on the current annual funding levels. NBHSS operations are unique in both their complexity and scale. Highly contaminated sediment is precisely dredged and  pumped in slurry through de-sanding, dewatering and treatment processes with the end product being clean water and dry filter cake that is then shipped to an offsite disposal facility. Strict cleanup criteria will need to be achieved by the RAC contractor in accordance with the criteria established in 1998 Record of Decision (ROD).  There are very few projects in the country that present the challenges faced by the contractor working in New Bedford.   <br>    <br>  The work under the solicitation involves providing all labor, equipment, materials, program/project/ construction management and engineering required to perform remediation of PCB contaminated sediment from the Acushnet River in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Remediation will be performed in accordance with the 1998 ROD and the four Explanation of Significant Difference (ESD).  This work includes sediment removal to cleanup levels, treatment and handling of the sediment and by products of processing of the sediment, transportation and disposal of contaminated material, maintenance, monitoring, and closure of Cell 1 (pilot CDF/Dredge Disposal Area), and monitoring of pilot cap area in the outer harbor. The work also includes remediation of wetlands and mudflat areas of the Acushnet River estuary. Proposed PCB disposal also includes construction of Confined Aquatic Disposal (CAD) cells to receive up to 300,000 cubic yards of untreated dredge material and will be performed under a separate contract.  The work performed under this solicitation may include disposal of some contaminated material in the constructed CAD cell.   <br>    <br>  As part of the remediation activities, a rigorous environmental monitoring program of air and water contamination will be implemented.  Results from the environmental monitoring program are used to ensure compliance with performance standards and may be used in contamination modeling applications.  <br>    <br>  Please note this is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about January 13, 2014. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of the solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at elandria.m.cameron@usace.army.mil.  <br>    <br>

The A-E contractor shall not submit a base contract (IDIQ, MATOC, etc.), or multiple task orders as a project, only individual task orders from a base contract can be submitted as one project. The Government will consider only the first five projects in the submission; any remaining projects will not count for the five projects.  These example projects shall be from the Prime or key subcontractors (a key subcontractor is a subcontractor that will perform 10% or more of the work for this contract) that demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in the design of military training ranges of similar size, scope and magnitude to the services being procured under this synopsis.  Preference will be given to projects that show the proposed team has worked together.  The submitting A-E contractor shall submit an unconditional letter of commitment signed by key subcontractors. (a key subcontractor is a subcontractor that will perform 10% or more of the work for this contract).  A Sample Letter of Commitment is attached to this synopsis.   <br>      <br>          <br>   3.2 Professional Qualifications Criteria (b): The submitting A-E contractor shall provide a Certificate of Authorization (or equivalent) to demonstrate that it is permitted by law to practice the professions of  architecture and/or engineering work in at least one state, territory, or jurisdiction of the United States as required by FAR 36.601-4(b).

The submitting A-E contractor shall submit unconditional letters of commitment for key personnel not currently employed by the prime or key subcontractor(s).  Letters of commitment are additionally required from any non-key subcontractors that will be providing key personnel.  The evaluation of personnel will consider education, certifications, training, registration, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and specialized experience as required above. (2) Qualified personnel to provide functional range training support. The personnel should be US Army trained and have experience with analysis of training ranges and facilities and familiarity with digitized automation and modernization efforts of the US Army. In addition, they should have extensive experience with current US Army training ranges, training manuals and tables, safety manuals, major weapon systems, and a working knowledge of the agencies involved with the Army's range modernization program. Preference would be given to former armor Master Gunners.   <br>       <br>   3.3 Past Performance Criteria (c): Past performance of the prime firm and any key subcontractors on DoD contracts for projects relevant in size, scope and similarity to the services being procured under this synopsis with respect to quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, as determined from ACASS and other sources will be used for evaluation of the A-E contractor. ACASS is the primary source of information on past performance (DFARS 236.602-1(a)(4)) that the evaluation board will consider.  ACASS / PPIRS may be queried for all prime / JV and key subcontractors.  The firm should also demonstrate the ability to comply with the proposed design cost and a history of designing projects to pre-defined construction cost limitations. Any credible, documented information on relevant past performance can be considered.   <br>   The submitting A-E contractor shall provide a reference using the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment 1) for each example project submitted by the A-E contractor under the Specialized Corporate Experience and Technical Competence.  The submitting A-E contractor is responsible for forwarding the PPQ to each past performance reference submitted under this synopsis.  The submitting A-E contractor should complete Blocks 1-4 of the PPQ and the client/customer complete Blocks 5-8 and the evaluation survey.  The client/customer should return the PPQ to the firm to be submitted with the SF330.   Each PPQ will be evaluated to determine if it is relevant to the design of facility repairs, renovations, conversions, or rehabilitations of similar size, scope and magnitude to the services being procured under this synopsis and design complete within the last three (3) years from the date of this synopsis, and if so, the quality of the A-E contractor's past performance will be assessed. In the event that adverse past performance information is obtained outside the PPIRS/ACASS, the firm will have the opportunity to respond to any adverse information received which it had not had a previous opportunity to comment if the vendor is in the slate of firms selected for discussions IAW FAR 36.602-3(c) or if adverse past performance is the determining reason why the firm is not in the slate of the most highly qualified firms.  If the A-E contractor's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can reasonably be assigned, or if sufficient past performance data cannot be obtained from the questionnaires, PPIRS, other sources or the firm has no past performance record, the firm in either instance will be given an  quote mark Unknown Risk quote mark  or  quote mark Neutral quote mark  rating.   <br>      <br>   3.4 Capacity Criteria (d): Firms competing shall demonstrate an effective organizational structure and quality management plan to accomplish multiple individual task orders simultaneously in a one year period of time with values ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000 each.  The evaluation will consider the management approach, coordination of disciplines and subcontractors, and quality control procedures to complete the aforementioned projects. The evaluation will also consider the prime contractor demonstrated ability to perform at least 50% of the work on each task order.   <br>      <br>   3.5 Knowledge of Locality Criteria (e): The submitting A-E contractor shall demonstrate their capability to perform work in multiple geographic regions. The A-E contractor should demonstrate the capability to design ranges throughout the various climate and geologic regions of the fifty (50) United States and its territories.  Greater consideration will be given to the A-E contractors with the demonstrated capability to perform work in diverse locations rather than only having capacity or ability in a limited geographic region.   <br>      <br>   3.6 SECONDARY SELECTION CRITERIA   <br>   3.6.1 Small Business (SB) and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation (f):  Extent of participation of small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort.        <br>      <br>   3.6.2 Volume of work Criteria (g):  Volume of DoD A-E contract awards in the last 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB.    <br>      <br>   4.0 SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The submitting A-E contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award.  The submitting A-E contractor may register via the SAM internet site at http://www.sam.gov.  SF-330 submissions will be received until 1400 (2:00 pm) Central Time on 30 December 2013.   Interested firms having the capabilities to perform the work described above must submit seven (7) hard copies and one (1) PDF copy on a compact disc (CD) of the SF 330 Part I and SF 330 Part II for the prime and key subcontractors or JV Partners to the Contract Specialist at the following address:   <br>   	   <br>   US Army Engineering and Support Center   <br>   CEHNC-CT   <br>   ATTN:  Ms. Raven Nall   <br>   4820 University Square   <br>   Huntsville AL  35816-1822   <br>      <br>   All hard copy submissions shall be identical in content.  The SF 330 Part I shall not exceed fifty (50) pages (8.5 quote mark  x 11 quote mark ), including no more than five (5) pages for Section H.

NOTICE OF ACTION: The Department of Veteran Affairs, Office of Acquisitions Operations (OAO), Strategic Acquisition Center - Frederick (SAC-F) is issuing an amendment to the Request for Information (RFI) No. VA119A-14-I-0021 to provide general information in response to questions received regarding Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) on-site verification examination re-compete.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

Q1.  Do you have to bid on the RFI to be included in the RFP?

No, it is not necessary to respond to the RFI in order to respond to the solicitation.  Further, in accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers (bids) and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any and all information requested in response to this RFI is for Market Research purposes only.  Interested firms are encouraged to respond.

Q2. Why is this just now being rebid if the incumbent's contract expired in Sept?  

The current contracts providing these services end March 31, 2014.

Q3. Is HeiTech Services still performing the work?

The services are being performed by ADDX Corporation and HeiTech Services, Inc.

Q4.  How come this requirement wasn't posted on FEDBiz as a sources sought synopsis as a SDVOSB set aside acquisition versus doing a request for information synopsis to see if any SDVOSB might be interested, instead of posting as full and open competition?

The acquisition strategy has not been determined and the nature of work performed under this RFI is specialized.  The responses received will assist in identifying qualified companies with the capability and resources to provide CVE on-site verification examinations and determine if this acquisition can be set-aside for Small Business (SB) concerns. 
Q5. Why couldn't the requirement be forwarded automatically to all those firms listed in VETBiz for the assigned NAICS Code 541611?

Limiting the RFI to only firms with NAICS code 541611 would not allow us to gather information regarding the appropriate NAICS code selection.  

 SUBMISSION DUE DATE: The RFI response date is not extend under this amendment; see original posting for specific details.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to make final clarifications to the synopsis for this A/E IDIQ.
1)	The Government intends to make award to the three highest rated offerors per station, for a total of 18 awards across the six VISN 19 stations.
2)	Seed projects were eliminated from the solicitation, and IDIQs.  The seed projects will no longer be awarded as a task order under one of the IDIQ contracts.  Prices from the most highly rated offerors will now be evaluated on each occupational discipline.

<DESC>The purpose of the work proposed here is to develop and demonstrate effective cyber security protection measures for small companies doing work for the DoD. Effectiveness will be assessed through measurement of cost/benefit of services as well as through modeling the impact of improved cyber security tools, policies, and guidelines on the DoD enterprise. These tools, policies, and guidelines will be assessed relative to small businesses operating in physical technology incubators, virtual incubators (clusters), or as stand-alone businesses. It will investigate potential threats and impact on small businesses and develop best practices to protect the small businesses from these threats. It will demonstrate the benefits of the improvements through application by deploying a low-cost Information Security Operations Center (ISOC).

<DESC>A quick response analytic assessment team is being stood up to support Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics USD (AT&amp;L) with acquisition decisions. The need for this team is made more acute by the growing number of current and future threats coupled with a period of increasing fiscal austerity. The team complements the existing studies of the Research, Development, and Acquisition Task Force (RDA TF) and the Red/Blue Analytic Assessment Team that also focuses on net technical assessments of current and projected anti-access and area denial capabilities of potential near peer adversaries. The Red/Blue Analytic Assessment Team studies traditionally span 2 month to 1 year in duration. The Quick Response Analytic Team will provide answers to critical questions in the 2 week to 2 month time frame.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The Space and Missile Systems Center, Range and Network Systems Division (SMC/RN) intends to extend the Launch &amp; Test Range System (LTRS) Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contract with Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., which ends on 7 December 2013, on a sole source basis.&nbsp; The performance period for the proposed contract action will consist of a six-month base period (8 December 2013 - 7 June 2014) and, as required, two three-month option periods (8 June 2014 - 7 December 2014).<br /><br />SMC/RN is planning for a competitive procurement to acquire SE&amp;I support for the three (3) programs which comprise SMC/RN for the period starting in FY14 through FY19.&nbsp; These programs are the Launch &amp; Test Range System (LTRS), Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), and the Space Training Acquisition Office (STAO).&nbsp; The market research used to determine if this effort should be competitive was conducted for the upcoming combined SE&amp;I support contract.&nbsp; It showed that 17 companies are able to provide this support; however, the schedule requirements for competition at this stage of the acquisition process would undoubtedly preclude award from being made before 7 December 2013 resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; The source is:<br /><br />Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.<br />8283 Greensboro Dr.<br />McLean, VA 22102-3838<br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within <strong>fifteen (15) calendar days</strong> of this posting; however, this is NOT a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; Interested parties must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government, and the services required will be provided in a timely and effective manner to meet the Government's requirements.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>REQUEST FOR APPROVAL SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1), GSAM 570.402-6</p>
<p><br />1.	IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>Approval is requested to negotiate a temporary extension of an existing lease without competition of approximately 6,137 Rentable square feet of office space at 2116 Greenbay Road, Evanston, Illinois for a term of two years (24 months), two years firm, effective January 15, 2014.</p>
<p><br />2.    DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED<br />The Social Security Administration has leased 2116 Greenbay Road, Evanston, Illinois since 1994 and has a continuing need for this space.  This property is used for office space.  The Social Security Administration has attempted to relocate from this location but was not able to complete a relocation transaction awarded in 2010.  This prior transaction was not completed and the awarded lease was terminated.  Since the lease termination in 2012, the agency has not identified its long term plans for this consolidation to the Contracting Officer.  The GSA Customer Delivery Team Manager and the Regional Account Manager are working closely with the facilities staff of the Social Security Administration to determine the long term requirements for this area.</p>
<p>3.	 IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1) Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p><br />4.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED</p>
<p>The functions to be housed in the space are integral to the agency's mission and cannot be housed in a timely fashion without a full set of requirements for a new procurement that will determine the long term requirement for the subject leased premises.  (FAR 6.302-1).</p>
<p>Continued temporary operation in this location make the award of the extension the most practical and advantageous, and lowest cost solution to the agency's space needs. (GSAM 570.402-6)</p>
<p><br />Contracting Officer Certification</p>
<p>I, the Lease Contracting Officer, hereby state that the above information is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  The aggregate value of the lease extension is approximately $400,000.  The aggregate value of the term of the lease, if not cancelled prior to the end of the term, is approximately $3,500,000.00.  Approval of this justification on the basis of the aggregate value of the extended lease is requested.</p>
<p>Routing and Approval Process Thresholds per Region 5 Regional Policy Letter Dated February 3, 2011:</p>
<p><br />a.	For procurements where the proposed value of the lease is less than $650,000, the OFOC must be submitted and certified by the LCO.</p>
<p>Certified by Mark A. Montgomery, Lease Contracting Officer on December 23, 2013.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR <br />USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity</p>
<p>The Regional Contracting Office-National Capital Region (RCO-NCR), 2010 Henderson Road, Quantico, Virginia 22134.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action Being Approved</p>
<p>Authority to act under this Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for a modification to a Firm Fixed Price award on a sole source basis (contractor: Advanced Survey Design, LLC is a SDVOSBC) for maintenance and support of the Marine Corps on-line Ground Climate Assessment Survey System (GCASS), Contract M00264-10-P-0258). A need now exists to increase the number of surveys funded under the contract to enable the Commandant Marine Corps (CMC) to address important leadership, readiness issues impacting the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services</p>
<p>In 2003, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) established a goal reducing preventable accidents by 50%. SECDEF increased this goal to 75% in 2006. The GCASS is one part of the CMC Safety Division's overall safety assessment program. GCASS is a proactive mishap prevention process that aids commanders and senior leadership in risk assessment and intervention strategy development. GCASS focuses on operations, maintenance, and other areas directly related to safety. The GCASS process involves collection of data from organizations by means of on-line survey measurement tools that quantify respondents' safety perceptions. These surveys examine the organizational climate using a human factors framework.</p>
<p>Despite parallel requirements for Command participation, the Commandant's Command Climate Survey (CCS) is experiencing a far higher degree of compliance from across the Marine Corps than has typically been experienced with GCASS. The visibility and leadership interest in this survey tool have prompted greater participation. With survey products that are established at a command (O-5) level, it is advantageous for the CCS to be administered separately by subordinate units due to geographical dispersion where the concerns of the command are more appropriately directed to the local Commander than aggregated to a Commanding Officer. While this also occurs with other survey types, the sensitivity and gravitas of the subject matter of the CCS have increased the desire of commanders to drive these surveys down to levels below O-5. The importance of this information has also prompted greater interest in analysis of the data gleaned from the survey. While individual results are confidential, the information that aggregate data provides about the Marine Corps are extremely valuable to leadership as they see to address important leadership, readiness issues by higher headquarter and command elements.</p>
<p><br />In order to support the increased demand for surveys below the O-5 level, participation by higher headquarters command elements and commensurate increase in analysis; a modification is being requested for 433 additional surveys plus 360 hours of analysis.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>The Commandant's Command Climate Survey was implemented and a new CLIN in Option Year 3 (of 4) of an existing Contract for the Ground Climate Safety Survey System (GCASS). Advanced Survey Design conducts GCASS for the Marine Corps and under separate Contracts also manages various survey instruments for the Department of the Navy, the Air Force, NASA and other agencies.</p>
<p>Advanced Survey Design was founded by Dr. Robert Figlock, a Marine Corps aviator with a strong interest in safety. ASD specializes in operational and maintenance safety assessments using a survey process well-grounded in organizational theory and risk management concepts. ASD is sole proprietor of the online assessment system that seamlessly aligns with CMC's mission and the broader fields of Naval Aviation and safety. In addition ASD employs a number of highly specialized former military officers whose expertise contributes to highly efficient and effective analysis and debriefing of Survey results.</p>
<p>The provisions of the contract with ASD do consider the possibility of a future award to a different contractor, in that the data is the property of the government. However, a critical element of these survey systems is the ability to identify trends and culture shifts. Therefore the effectiveness of the system would be significantly impaired if multiple providers were employed simultaneously. The contract structure is reconciled to the objective of promoting competition by allowing for the transfer of the entire data set to the executing contractor in future acquisition cycle(s). ASD's proprietary collection and user interface remain ASD intellectual property. It would be expected that a new contractor would establish a similar user interface proprietary to them. It would be unacceptable to provide multiple competing contractors access through each other's systems to facilitate the critical analysis and trending that is essential to the process.</p>
<p>6. Description of Market Research</p>
<p>CMC SD has contracted for various survey instruments using multiple vendors over the past decade. The pricing of such products varies based on a number of factors: (1) whether the product is delivered on-line or is also provided in a "paper" version; (2) the extent of any tracking, follow up and reporting required of the contractor; and (3) whether any on-site time is required of the Contractor in the execution of surveys or followup actions.</p>
<p>In comparison to other products, the CCS, as well as the GCASS after which it is structured, incorporates efficiencies developed over time and well understood across the fleet. There is no on-site time requirement in the execution of surveys. Travel is reserved for higher leadership and strategy discussions, analysis, and evaluation at the program level. Separately contracting the CCS would create confusion and increase costs if a different contractor were introduced to conduct this work at this time. The government accepts that these products will be re advertised on a five year acquisition cycle, and with only 17 months before the next award the consolidation of CCS with the GCASS Contract has contributed to a more rapid implementation and gleaning of valuable feedback by Commanding Officers and higher leadership. Continued success is anticipated with the award of the CCS CLIN in Option Year 4, and will likely result in the continued coupling of these efforts under a single new contract in the next cycle.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost</p>
<p>The government uses the historical performance of this contractor on previous contracts and the published GSA costing to compare against the rates and labor evident in this procurement. As described in paragraph 6, previous contracted efforts to provide similar survey products involved significantly greater cost.</p>
<p>8. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Future Competition</p>
<p>The current contract was offered for competition as a set-aside for Service Disable Veteran-Owned Business (SDVOSB) but only one proposal was received. The Contractor is also has a GSA schedule. Award of this additional work meets the conditions whereby the Contracting Officer (CO) may award a sole source contract:</p>
<p>a. The requirement is not exempted from SDVO contracting and cannot be set-aside.<br />b. There is not a reasonable expectation that at least two responsible SDVO SBCs will submit offers for this added work. <br />c. The anticipated award price of the contract, including options, will not exceed $3.0M.</p>
<p>It is possible that additional SDVO SBCs may participate in the next acquisition cycle. The government anticipates offering this requirement as a competitive solicitation SDVO set-aside in the next acquisition cycle.</p>
