<DESC>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is operated by Stanford University for the Department of Energy. As a management and operating contractor, subcontracts awarded by the Laboratory are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect our DOE approved purchasing system, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.
<p>&nbsp;Sources sought for:<br /><br />General Description: <br />X-ray/XUV CCD camera: Back illuminated CCD for direct detection of X-rays between ~ 30 eV and 10 keV (no AR coating)</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria:<br />1. &gt;1.5 Mpixel sensor</p>
<p>2. 20um x 20 um pixels<br />3. Two distinct amplifiers, one for low noise and for high capacity outputs:</p>
<p>Single pixel full well of 250 K electrons in low noise output (Effectively utilizes the CCD's full well).</p>
<p>1000Ke in High Capacity mode</p>
<p>4. Dual speed amplifiers with two separate Analog to Digital Converters with 16 bits resolution. 100khz and 2Mhz.</p>
<p>5. Ability to control external shutters<br />6. Low noise for detecting ultra-low light levels: 3 e- RMS @100kHz 7. USB 2.0 8. Vacuum compatible</p>
<p>Source selection: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable</p>

1.	Purpose
2.	Scope
3.	Service Areas/Performance Requirements/Necessary Conditions
4.	Glossary
5.	Appendix A- Specifications for Monitoring Systems and Devices

1.  Purpose  

The purpose of this contract is to provide Dosimetry Services using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) Technology. The services includes automatic exchange-outs of dosimeters each wear period, processing and analysis of dosimeters, data management, archival storage of exposed results, standard radiation dosimetry, with customer services and technical support. A wide variety of radionuclides are used for biomedical research, medical diagnosis, and patient treatment. A complete range of diagnostic and therapeutic x-ray equipment is employed. 

For purposes of this contract, the term "dosimeter" or "monitor"  is an individual monitoring device that requires processing to determine the radiation dose and that is used by VA Puget Sound Health Care System.  

The VA  possesses a permit to operate under federal regulations issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and is required to comply with 10 CFR 20.1201, 20.1501, and  other applicable provisions of Title 10 Chapter 20 specified in the permit,  in addition to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations listed under 29 CFR 1096.1906 for non-NRC regulated functions. These regulatory bodies provide specific requirements for monitoring external personnel radiation exposure.     
 
1.2 Personnel Radiation Monitoring Program

The present size of the VA monitoring program has expanded in recent years due to new badging requirements for users of fluoroscopic imaging modalities, with the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) currently issuing approximately 365 dosimeters per month.  This includes 325 whole body dosimeters, 30 extremity TLD rings, up to 3 fetal monitors, and 6 environmental monitors.  Currently, these dosimeters are monitored and exchanged on a monthly or quarterly schedule. 

1.3 Program Goals

The goals of the Personnel Radiation Monitoring Program are:

a.	Precluding the overexposure of  personnel to radiation through a program of:

(1)	Monitoring
(2)	Reporting
(3)	Education and control of the use of Ionizing Radiation

1.4	Performance Periods.

Base year contract performance shall be for a period of 12 months commencing, or the date of the award whichever is later to include four option years.

<DESC>*** Registration information updated with revised cut-off date.  Due to the number of registrations already received, the cut-off date for pre-registration has been changed to 12 November, 2015, at 1600 EST.  There will be no registration on the day of the event.  Description: The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Navy Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), the Naval Enterprise Networks Program Office (PMW 205), and the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) will host an Industry Day on 17 November 2015, at the following location:  Crystal Gateway Marriott 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway Arlington, Virginia 22202 08:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Scope of Industry Day: The purpose of this announcement is to invite businesses to an Industry Day event that will allow the Government to gather information to assist the Navy and Marine Corps in determining an acquisition approach for any potential NGEN follow-on contract(s). Information from this event and any future RFIs may be used to help the Navy determine the number, timing, structure (e.g., contract type), terms and conditions, and tasks of any potential contract(s) that may be issued as follow-ons to the current NGEN contract. As part of the days agenda, PMW 205 representatives and members of the Navy/USMC acquisition community will provide: (1) present-day views of USN and USMC network scope and scale; and (2) conceptual views of the re-compete scope of effort, future portfolio of services, and future acquisition/procurement approach. The Industry Day will incorporate panel discussions to facilitate the desired information exchange between Government and industry.  The Government intends to leverage service delivery infrastructure mechanisms that include: (a) the Navy Marine Corps Intranet; (b) the Marine Corps Enterprise Network; and, (c) the cloud, to include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS). The key tenets of any potential future contracts include: global reach; speed to delivery; cloud-based services; innovation; mobility; data analytics; and, cybersecurity. PMW 205 encourages small business participation in the Industry Day to increase the visibility of potential small business opportunities in the NGEN follow-on contracts.  Registration: Registration is limited by venue capacity and early registration is strongly recommended to expedite event check-in. Attendees may register via e-mail by sending a request to NGEN_Industry_Day@navy.mil including your name, company name, CAGE, names of attendees (five maximum), phone number(s), and e-mail addresses. Registered attendees will be provided additional information regarding directions, parking, check-in, etc., one week prior to the event. There will be no registration on the day of the event.  Please plan to arrive early.  Organizations are limited to five (5) attendees.  The cut-off date for pre-registration is 12 November, 2015, at 1600 EST.  There is no fee for any Industry Day activity.
