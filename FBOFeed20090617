<DESC><p>This is a Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority, 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

ATTACHMENT: SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request #F2XHC79117AQ01.
<p>MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB-2<br />ATTN: CHARLIE H. FOSTER, JR.</p>
<p>FROM: CCAF/CC<br />130 W. Maxwell Blvd<br />Maxwell AFB AL 36112</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request # F2XHC79117AQ01<br /><br />1. Description of the supplies and services being acquired: The purpose of this acquisition is for the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) to continue to license and use the Singularity transcript processing system and obtain technical support for the system. <br /><br />2. Justification for Sole Source: CCAF, under contract numbers FA3300-06-P-0214, FA3300-07-P-0188 and FA3300-08-P-0126, has been using Hershey Business Systems Inc. (HBSI) as the prime contractor to develop the web-enabled, enterprise-wide transcript processing and access management system known as Singularity. HBSI is the sole provider of this software and is the only known source that can fill the unique licensing and maintenance requirements of this system in a cost effective, timely manner. The software is developed by HBSI and they maintain proprietary data rights. CCAF will continue to closely monitor ongoing advancements and design innovations in the commercial computer software industry, and will actively solicit input from additional contractors in the future to assure full and open competition is available on all future acquisitions of this type. This software must be licensed annually and maintained through software updates, patches and additional capabilities. This effort requires the contractor to have considerable knowledge of CCAF's Student Transcript, Administration and Record System (STARS), remote Education Services Offices access processes, and the integration and delivery of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 130 transaction files from the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) EDI server located on the University of Texas campus. Over the past few years, HBSI acquired a thorough understanding of CCAF's business processes and developed system specifications to enhance the tracking of scanned and electronically received transcript information into CCAF's STARS system. HBSI has also worked with CCAF technical personnel to deliver out-bound sorting of transcript data from STARS and formatting electronic transcripts to conform to the 130 transaction set used by the AACRAO EDI server. HBSI has developed this expertise over the last 8 years by working with major higher education institutions similar to CCAF. Throughout this period, HBSI has developed a web-based framework that is compliant with a variety of products and services that enhance student success, credit transfer and records retention.</p>
<p>3. Justification that source is the only known source: It has been determined that no other contractor who specializes in similar projects could accomplish the deployment and/or support the application. In addition, the current developed software codes and comprehensive understanding of CCAF internal business processes, along with the expertise of the external EDI transactions, support the fact that no other contractor could adequately support the current application and future enhancements.</p>
<p>4. Actions taken to preclude future sole source applications: No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions (proprietary ownership of Singularity Imaging System and Software).</p>

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04BC25C with Eloret Corporation on a sole-sourcebasis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of AmesResearch Center's (ARC) Code TS, Space Technology Division. The objective is to extendthe performance period for eight months. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underSpace Technology Research and Development (STRAD). The principal purpose of this contractis to support the Space Technology Division at NASA Ames Research Center to obtain theservices needed for the development of technologies for use in the design and fabricationof prototype vehicles that travel at hypervelocities in the atmosphere of Earth and otherbodies in the solar system. The Contractor provides support in the areas of Reacting FlowEnvironments, Nanotechnology, Thermo-Physics Facilities, and Thermal Protection Materialsand Systems. This extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure programcontinuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts whilea competitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04BC25C,for a period of eight months, from August 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010, and increasethe contract value accordingly.  The current contractor, Eloret Corporation, isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension. Awarding an eight-month contract to another source, at thesame time evaluation of proposals received for the follow-on contract is in process,would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfillingthe Governments requirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, therebyaffecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCsrequirements.The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement.  Procurement activityfor the follow-on contract has been initiated under NNA07198991R-ACA, and market researchhas been performed.  The follow-on contract will be solicited on small business set-asidebasis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4 PM PST on June25, 2009. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.Questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Lana Jones Clemon atLana.Jones.Clemon@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT BOILER PLANT DEFICIENCIESSTATEMENT OF WORKCorrection of Safety and Reliability DeficienciesBoilers and Boiler Plant Auxiliary EquipmentVAMC Clarksburg, WVMay 2009General Requirements:Work on burners and control systems must be performed by a skilled boiler/burner controls service technician.Upon completion of each item, test operation and provide data sheet showing test results including set point and operating point.All testing procedures must comply with VHA Boiler Plant Safety Device Testing Manual, 3rd Edition. Boilers:1.    For Boilers #1 & 2: The high pressure gas fuel cutoff switches (HPFCS) are not located properly. They are now located downstream of the fuel flow control valve where the gas pressure varies when the burner firing rate varies. The proper location is between the gas pressure regulator and the flow control valve, where the pressure is constant. This will protect against a regulator failure at all firing rates.a.	Relocate the switches as shown on attached Burner Gas Piping Schematic Diagram. Connections between switches and gas piping must have lockable valves and valved test ports.b.	Adjust set points to 120% of regulated gas pressure.c.	If there are nuisance burner trips due to inaccurate gas pressure regulation, the pressure regulators must be repaired or replaced to provide the required accurate pressure control. This will make the burner operation more efficient at low loads and allow proper setting of the pressure switch for maximum safety.d.	Test switch and interlock operation.2.    For Boilers #1 & 2: The proof of closure switches (POC) on the automatic oil fuel safety shut off valves open at about 60% of valve stroke. The POC switches are "valve seal overtravel" switches and it is apparent that the valves are not properly adjusted when the POC are still made at 60% of valve stroke. It is likely that the valves are flowing oil when the POC switches are made.a.	Repair or replace valves. Valve repair must conform to the requirements of the valve manufacturer.b.	Test valves for seat leakage and for proper operation of the POC switches.3.    For Boilers #1 & 2: The pre-purge airflow proving switches are not plumbed correctly.a.	Replumb the pressure sensing lines to measure pressure differential between the forced draft fan discharges (after any dampers) and the boiler outlets, before the economizers.b.	Adjust the switches to "make" at 80% of the maximum pressure differential at high fire.c.	Test the switch and interlock operation.4.       For Boilers #1, 2 & 3: The existing forced draft fan motor interlocks not sufficient to prove     the forced draft fans are actually running.a.

A deadband value of zero will cause an entry in the file each time the real-time value is examined. Files shall be organized according to time and will contain values for multiple, named variables. The files can be placed on the hard disk or floppy disk. Provide a mechanism for on-line maintenance and automatic purging of files.c.	The data to be collected by the archiving program will be identified through an interactive, menu-based configuration.  The user will enter the tag name, collection rate, and data compression deadband value. Collection rates shall be selectable: 1 second, 2 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 10 minutes.d.	The operator shall be able to recall archived data from the disk to be displayed in graphic format along with real-time data.  The display of archived data shall be user-configurable. It shall be possible to configure objects in graphic displays that, when selected, fetch pre-defined historical trend data from disk and display it to the operator. Attributes of pens shall be editable during run-time.e.	The historical trend display shall be made up of the following components: 1)	Pen Group:  Configuration shall be used to define the particular tag names to be displayed.  Along with tag names, pen color, marker style and engineering units may be defined.2)	Time Group:  Configuration shall be used to define the time period over which the archived data is to be displayed.3)	Legend Group:  Configuration shall be used to define the legend parameters for a historical display.  Both a primary and alternate legend may be displayed.f.	The display shall support unlimited variables to be displayed on the same time/value axis simultaneously.  For each entry in the display list, the operator will be able to assign a given tag name and marker to a particular line color selected from palettes of unlimited colors.  The operator may also enter display engineering units ranges to cause scaling of the display.  Support shall be provided for multiple, different y-axis engineering units to be displayed as appropriate.g.	The display shall have two fields of view.  The top portion of the screen shall be the graphic field and will display the values of the variables (y-axis) against time (x-axis).  It will also contain labels for the axes and graphs.  The bottom portion of the screen shall be user-configurable to display information, such as node-names, tag names, and descriptors, pertaining to the tags in the trend display.h.	The trend object shall allow for bi-directional trending and scrolling. A movable, vertical line will act as a time cursor on the display. The date, time and values of the trends corresponding to that time will be displayed in the bottom portion of the screen. The grid of the trend object shall be scrollable. The trend shall be shifted forward or backward in time by clicking on the right/left buttons. New data shall be fetched from the historical file as appropriate. The ability to display historical data with current data on the same chart must be supported.  A transparent option for the trend must be selectable. The user shall be able to "zoom" on any section of the trend display by "cutting" that section with the mouse.  The software will automatically re-scale both the y-axis and the time axis and will fetch the appropriate data for the time period selected. The trend object must have a refresh rate selectable in 0.1 second increments from a minimum of 0.10 seconds to a maximum of 1800 seconds.i.	The trend display shall be printable to a black and white or color printer via the standard MS Windows NT print manager.14.	Event Scheduling:a.	The system shall support a scheduler with time-based printing of reports.b.	The system shall allow for scheduling of the following time-based printing of reports:  Hourly, shift, daily, monthly, yearly.15.	Security Management:a.	Provide a user-based security system which, when enabled, must allow for the creation of users with certain rights and/or privileges.  These rights must include the ability to run any combination or all of the applications in the data acquisition system.  The ability to allow or disallow users access to change values, such as set points and control setups, on an individual tag basis shall be supported. b.	Groups of users, such as operators or supervisors, can be created and granted rights.  All users assigned to a group obtain the rights of the group although they are tracked by the system by their individual ID.  Individual members of a group may be also assigned additional rights.c.	The system must support a tie to Windows NT security.  When user-based security is enabled, an audit trail will be generated in the system, which will tag every operator action with a user ID.  d.	The system must support at least twenty separate security areas, assignable on a per-tag basis. Each tag can be assigned all of the available security areas, none of the available security areas, or up to three individual security areas.

Belkin is currently the only manufacturere of a TAA Compliant KVM Suite and GITM has therefore been using the Belkin KVM Suite of equipment exclusively. The Belkin KVM Suite of equipment cannot be used without the Interface Adapters. The Belkin KVM Adapters listed above will be used with Belkin KVM Switches that were previously purchased on order 1019-832222 (SAQMMA08F5196). Cisco equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities taht requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches: HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). APC Smart-UPS Units are IRm ITCCB-approved hardware and have been used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested byt the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and calssified IT refreshes. IRM/OPS/ITI/GITM identified the Rack Solutions 19-Inch Rack-Mount Shelf as the only suitable item availble in the market today meeting the Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, packaging, durability and easy of use with the current GITM Netowrk backup Soultion. Furthermore, the equipment listed in paragraph (2) is on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department of compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Deaprtment at risk and will casue unacceptable delays to the Program's scheudle in support of the unclassifed and classified IT refresh efforts. Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquistion is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. As this is a brand name only justifcation, no one contractor's unique qualificatiosn are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Deparment's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassifed and classified networks.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>Recovery - Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and Service Technical Assistance Management Support
<p>HRSA RFP Number: HRS8285</p>
<p>The Health Resources and Services (HRSA) is seeking proposals from organization recognized as 8(a) contractors by the Small Business Administration to obtain technical assistance (TA) to the Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and Service (BCS) sites, BCRS staff and BCRS partners/stakeholders both on-site and off-site. <br />The NAICS Code is 541611 Size Standard of $6.0 million. The TA is designed to assist potential and approved BCRS sites in many facets of their development, operations, and in the retention of BCRS clinicians to ultimately improve delivery of health care services to the underserved. BCRS is responsible for administering the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program, NHSC Scholarship Program, NHSC Ready Responder Program, Nursing Scholarship Program, Nursing Loan Repayment Program, the Faculty Loan Repayment Program, and the Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program. BCRS provides assistance to current sites participating in these programs, as well as potential sites and communities. It is expected that there will be approximately 5,000 additional BCRS sites as a result of the ARRA. These efforts support the successful completion of the service obligation of clinicians in their assigned communities. To accomplish this increase in workload, BCRS requires the use of expert consultants with various professional and educational backgrounds to augment the BCRS staff expertise available. To successfully accomplish the BCRS' functions and ensure that specialized skills and expanded program knowledge and expertise are available, BCRS requires assistance to develop and manage a roster of consultants to work with sites, communities, and staff. BCRS will need assistance with the logistics and support necessary for the consultants' travel and reimbursement of expenses and fees. BCRS will require expert TA in a variety of areas to efficiently and effectively execute BCRS' mission. The Contractor shall provide expert assistance to BCRS sites, clinicians, staff and partners/stakeholders across the United States and U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and Palau). This assistance will include on-site and off-site (e.g., site visits, conference calls, BCRS conferences), pre-application TA, routine TA, and targeted (problem focused) TA, as described below. The TA is designed to assist potential and current BCRS sites in many facets of their development, operations, and in the retention of BCRS clinicians to ultimately improve delivery of health care services to underserved communities and provide assistance to BCRS supported health care providers in their efforts to successfully complete their service commitments. This assistance is intended to improve the overall health of the Nation's underserved populations by increasing the number, eligibility, and compliance of sites, clinicians and communities supporting the BCRS mission. The Government is seeking access to expert consultants who are qualified and experienced in a range of specialty areas. In particular, the contractor shall arrange consultant assistance for different areas of TA. The Contractor shall submit recommended consultants for each TA task to the Project Officer (PO). Typically, the TA team will be comprised of one to two (1-2) consultants, one to two (1-3) federal staff, and appropriate local or state representatives who will jointly provide TA. The Contractor shall assemble and have available a roster of consultants that are diverse and representative of the range of specialty area. The Contractor shall arrange expert assistance as described below for three different types of TA. Initially, this TA will be accomplished using standard protocols previously developed by BCRS. Protocols will be provided to the Contractor by the COTR. The first type of TA is pre-application TA to support potential BCRS communities and sites. The second type of TA, Routine TA, is to support currently approved BCRS service sites and involves comprehensive reviews to ensure compliance with program requirements.3) The third type of TA, Targeted TA, also supports currently approved BCRS service sites and is provided in response to concerns communicated to the BCRS (e.g., unresolved conflict between clinicians and site administration or other clinical staff; work schedule discrepancies; site Bankruptcies/financial difficulties; termination of BCRS clinicians, etc.) It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee type award with a period of performance is for one year with four one year options. This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) will be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov approximately fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. It can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations-Division of Procurement Management. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance/posting of the RFP. It shall be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this website for the RFP and any amendments to the RFP. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources. The contact person for this acquisition is: Debora A. Pitts, Contracts Operations Branch, DPM/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-3789 or 443-2750; FAX 301-443-6038.<br />This pre-solicitation notice fulfill the disclosure requirement under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.</p>

<DESC>The Structures and Materials and Aerodynamic, Aerothermodynamic and AcousticsTechnology for Aerospace Vehicles (SMAAATAV) contract is a multiple award, IndefiniteDelivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) instrument.   The four SMAAATAV contracts NNL04AA10B,NNL04AA11B, NNL04AA12B and NNL04AA13B are held by Analytical Services & Materials, Inc.,The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and Northrop Grumman SystemsCorporation, respectively.  NASA LaRC intends to increase the total cumulative maximumcontract value amongst the four contracts by $19,750,000 from $39,000,000 to $58,750,000for the continuation of aerospace services.NASA LaRC is currently conducting a competition to award the successor contract forStructures, Materials, Aerodynamics, Aerothermodynamics and Acoustics Research andTechnology (SMAAART). It is anticipated that the follow-on contract will be awarded latein calendar year 2009.	Due to unanticipated requirements, the current IDIQ ceiling of$39,000,000 has been reached, and NASA LaRC has continuing Agency and Center criticalrequirements that must be met. This increase to the current multiple award IDIQ contractsis a stop gap measure to serve as a bridge to cover critical NASA work and to allowsufficient time for NASA LaRC to complete the competitive, follow-on SMAAART acquisition. Because of the time needed to complete the competition, and compete and award new tasksunder these new contracts, the current increase is necessary to ensure work can continueduring this period of transition to avoid an interruption in the critical work notedabove.	Provisions for this Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition are made underthe statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only OneResponsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), full and open competition need not be provided for whenthe supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one or a limitednumber of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfyagency requirements.

synthesis of deuterated trityl paramagnetic imaging contrast agent, OX071 from
GE Healthcare; P.O. Box 4220 Nydalen; 0401 Oslo, Norway. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This acquisition will be

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Biophysics Branch in the
Radiation Biology Branch at the National Cancer Institute is currently
developing new imaging modalities to study physiological responses of tumors
and normal tissues to radiation and chemotherapy drugs. The OX071 compound is a
deuterated version of <a name="OLE_LINK1"><span>(tris[8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetrakis(2-hydroxymethol)benzol[1,2-<em>d&rsquo;</em>]bix(1,3)dithio-4-yl]methyl radical) </span></a>and
is a contrast agent used in the NCI&rsquo;s Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
imaging and low field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies. These imaging
modalities rely on paramagnetic contrast reagents which exhibit a single narrow
line EPR spectra, are water soluble, and are non-toxic in animals. OX071 is the
most appropriate candidate that meets the above specifications. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The development of the EPR
imaging instrumentation is completely dependent on the use of a very specific
free radical compound, OX071.<span>&nbsp; </span>The OX071
is one of only a few compounds which can be used successfully to determine
tissue oxygen levels in either mice or humans.<span>&nbsp; </span>GE Healthcare is the only known company that can synthesize the OX071 in
the required amounts the EPRI project requires for adequate testing.<span>&nbsp; </span>The chemical synthesis of the OX071 is
extremely demanding and requires multiple steps to achieve both purity and
quantity.<span>&nbsp; </span>GE Healthcare is the only known
company which can achieve both the purity and quantity necessary for the EPRI
project to advance and is proprietary to GE Healthcare.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is not a solicitation

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 the business size standard is 6.5M.

The period of performance for this procurement shall be twelve months from date of award.

The Biophysics Section of the Lab of Cell Biology currently owns the FEI Nova 200 electron microscope to perform the collection of structural data from a wide range of biological specimens by the “Slice and View” method which is unique to this instrument.
Contractor shall provide one (1) preventative maintenance inspection, emergency service and replacement parts.

Modern Electron Microscopes such as the Nova200 manufactured by FEI Company , currently installed in the lab is a highly complex instrument requiring continuous servicing by qualified engineers. The instrumentation encompasses high vacuum components, electromagnetic lenses, FEI CCD cameras, pneumatic systems all highly integrated into computer controlled access to the various microscope functions. Therefore a comprehensive Service Contract is essential for the smooth operation of the microscope. 

There is a complex level of digital access to all FEI electron microscopes and FEI CCD cameras including the Nova200 permitted only to the qualified FEI service engineers.
Only FEI certified service engineers who are employees of the company and are trained in all aspects of service to electron microscopes are authorized to service the Nova200. The warranty on the microscope and all the parts is only guaranteed if it is serviced by FEI Engineers. These engineers are officially on call during the regular work week but will also answer emergency calls so as not to disrupt any ongoing use of the microscope. It is therefore imperative that each electron microscope must have an annual service contract. In addition, FEI holds multiple patents on the Nova200 D102 instrument and is the sole source manufacturer for all replacement parts and accessories regarding service. 

Each part of the instrument requires special handling which needs approval from FEI for replacements under the warranty. The Lab of Cell Biology is constantly upgrading the operating system with newest versions of the software and hardware. The new software requires fine-tuning, which is needs to be completed under the service contract for patent reasons. The service contract is quintessential for normal function of the heavily used systems including the Nova200.

<DESC><p>The National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, WA has a requirement for Steller Seal Lion research in the Russian Far East.
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to supplement work previously undertaken in the Russian Far East and increase the area of coverage to ensure that all major Russian sea lion rookeries are monitored. Rookeries to be monitored are field camp deployments on the Kuril Islands, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Commander Islands, along the Kamchatka coast to resight marked Steller sea lions and mark pups on selected rookeries, as well as a new rookery near Sakhalin Island that has never been included in previous work. The addition of this sight would greatly improve our understanding of the movements of sea lions from Russia into Japanese waters. Contractor will be responsible for conducting boat surveys of all known rookeries and haulout sites in the western Bering Sea, Commander Islands, Sea of Okhotsk, and East Kamchatka, and the Kuril Island chain to (1) brand pups and collect necessary physiological information; (2) to collect brand resight data from designated field camps; and (3) provide a scientist fluent in both English and Russian to conduct the work.</p>
<p>This work will collect information on the number of Steller sea lion pups and non-pups and collect brand resight data. In addition, where possible, fecal samples, tissue samples, and blood will be collected to provide diet information of the Steller sea lions in the surveyed areas. A maximum of 43 known Steller sea lion sites located along approximately 1,160 nautical miles of coast line will be surveyed. The data collection format will need to be similar to previous surveys in order to have results comparable with previous historical data. The current trend of Steller sea lion abundance in three areas of the Russian Far East will be estimated and brand resight information added into an existing database.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is expected to be September 16, 2009 through September 15, 2010 with two optional one-year periods.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 and the size standard is $7.0M.

<DESC>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SOUGHT

The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Gainesville, Florida that will be expiring August 31, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,916 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space and 27 reserved, onsite, paved parking spaces. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,560 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 5 years, with a 5-year renewal option, and must include the right to terminate at any time after the first year with 120 days written notice.  First floor space is preferred.  All utilities, janitorial service, lawn care, maintenance services, tenant alterations and off-street parking are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. In addition, the space must meet the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS) and will not be located in a flood plain. The space must be available for occupancy within 60 days of award.  Due to time constraints, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CONSIDER BUILD TO SUIT.  The delineated area is: 

North:  US Hwy 441 at junction with NW 43 St
West:   NW 43 St from junction with US Hwy 441 to NW 53 Av
South:  NW 30 Av
East:    US Hwy 441

Other applicable requirements include:
• All space shall be controllable and securable from other building areas.
• Access to space shall be provided 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
• Space must meet or be adapted to meet IT and server wiring specifications.
• Parking: 25 on site paved parking spaces and area to accommodate large trucks, horse trailers, etc.
• Offered space must qualify or score as an Operating Lease.  The Government will not enter into a Capital Lease agreement. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SOUGHT

The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Gainesville, Florida that will be expiring August 31, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,916 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space and 27 reserved, onsite, paved parking spaces. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,560 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 5 years, with a 5-year renewal option, and must include the right to terminate at any time after the first year with 120 days written notice.  First floor space is preferred.  All utilities, janitorial service, lawn care, maintenance services, tenant alterations and off-street parking are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. In addition, the space must meet the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS) and will not be located in a flood plain. The space must be available for occupancy within 60 days of award.  Due to time constraints, THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CONSIDER BUILD TO SUIT.  The delineated area is: 

North:  US Hwy 441 at junction with NW 43 St
West:   NW 43 St from junction with US Hwy 441 to NW 53 Av
South:  NW 30 Av
East:    US Hwy 441

Other applicable requirements include:

• All space shall be controllable and securable from other building areas.

• Access to space shall be provided 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

• Space must meet or be adapted to meet IT and server wiring specifications.

• Parking: 25 on site paved parking spaces and area to accommodate large trucks, horse trailers, etc.

• Offered space must qualify or score as an Operating Lease.  The Government will not enter into a Capital Lease agreement. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Cobham Mission Systems (formerly Carleton Technologies Incorporated) 2734 Hickory Grove Road, Davenport, IA 52804 for the acquisition of spare parts and components for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Viper VSW Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA).  The components being acquired are ten (10) exhale elbow connectors (p/n 1104-H08), ten (10) inhale elbow connectors (p/n 1104-H09), twenty (20) power inflators (p/n 1375-A30), ten (10) strap canisters (p/n 2108-A37), five (5) Mk-48 full face masks (p/n 2117-A05), ten (10) 24-M soft goods kits (p/n 2400-A07SG), five (5) MK11 buoyancy compensators (p/n B60040-1), twenty (20) MK11 soft goods kits.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. The MK 11 Viper VSW UBA is a NAVSEA "Certified" Diving Life Support System (DLSS).   Cobham Mission Systems is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MK 11 Viper VSW UBA.  As the OEM, only Cobham can accurately provide all of the spare parts for the MK 11 Viper VSW  UBA.

The components and raw materials that make up the system fall within the scope of certification boundaries.  Substitution of similar materials and components are not authorized without the expressed permission of NAVSEA 00C4 and requires an approved departure from the specification.  In summary, Cobham Mission Systems is the only responsible source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK11 Viper VSW UBA.  There are no other companies that manufacture this critical life support equipment. The required delivery date will be 9 Months after receipt of order.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination to NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407.  .  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541990, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The closing date to submit quotes is 13 July  2009.

<a href="mailto:caryn.mcgraw@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>NOTE- The first industry day is scheduled for June 25 and 26.  Information on how to register is available on FEDBIZOPS under JUTC, Announcement number<BR>JOINT-URBAN-TEST-CAPABILITY-JUTC<BR><BR>Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC)<BR>Request for Information (RFI)<BR><BR>Closing Date: 27 JULY 2009<BR><BR>Synopsis:<BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI); Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Instrumentation Management Office (IMO), as the material developer for the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), are seeking industry information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Joint Urban Test Capability (JUTC).  Attachment 1 is the draft JUTC Test Capabilities Requirements Document (TCRD).  Once the TCRD is approved, all the performance specifications and Statement of Work (SOW) will be derived from the approved TCRD.  Request for information responses may address available products and technologies to produce components or a complete capability to provide new test capabilities to fully support all current and emerging requirements to test current, new, and emerging technologies and systems within an urban environment.  JUTC will be a comprehensive solution to enhance the developmental and operational testing capabilities at each of the test ranges.  PM ITTS is the lead for the acquisition of this capability.   <BR><BR>Background:<BR>The U.S. military has an immediate need for a robust Joint Urban Operations (JUO) testing capability.  The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Report identifies the ability to operate in urban terrain as a critical capability requirement.  A major requirement for JUO testing is a set of realistic urban environments ranging from small rural villages to modern metropolises that pose challenges to air, ground, and maritime systems and system-of-systems (SoS) operating as part of a Joint Task Force (JTF).  While limited representations of small urban environments exist, current urban test and training facilities have deficiencies of size, complexity, realism, and control that prevent them from completely fulfilling this requirement.  If the military cannot test in operationally realistic Joint urban environments, the JTF will be hard pressed to achieve its objectives / goals during hybrid, full spectrum Joint operations.  This need was outlined in the 2007 DoD Strategic Plan for T&E Resources.  To better understand the need, the Strategic Plan called for an Urban Environment Test Capability (UETC) study to define the urban environment test capability requirements for a realistic, reconfigurable, instrumented urban test environment, which makes use of existing DoD infrastructure and advancements in distributed live-virtual-constructive (LVC) capabilities.  <BR><BR>The JUTC program may develop a myriad of technical solutions to include augmentation of existing live urban test ranges with advanced data collection systems and effects generators, as well as linking and integrating these live ranges with virtual and constructive urban simulations for a distributed, capability-based Joint urban test environment for Joint brigade and below force structure operations.  JUTC will provide:<BR>* Common test architecture<BR>* Common structural augmentation<BR>* Common test tools<BR>* Common threats and human-social-cultural behavior (HSCB) representations<BR>* Common test management and control<BR><BR>Industry Day:<BR>Interaction with Industry will be a multi-step process.  Step one is the release of a draft TCRD and the complete Request for Information (RFI).  It is the Governments intent to conduct an Industry Day in Orlando, Florida on 25 - 26 June 2009. The intent of the Industry Day is to clearly present the Governments requirements to potential bidders.  Following the Government presentations, Industry will have the opportunity to participate in one-on-one interaction with the customer during the afternoon of 25 June 2009 and all day on 26 June 2009.  Responses to the RFI will be completed 30 days after the Industry Day, specifically 27 July 2009 or sooner.  Step two, is to conduct a second Industry Day in Orlando, Florida on 25  26 August 2009.  Preceding the 2nd Industry Day, the Government will release an updated draft TCRD and RFI.  One-on-one discussions with the customer will be available on the afternoon of 25 August 2009 and all day on 26 August 2009.  <BR><BR>Detailed Requirements:<BR>PM ITTS is looking for suppliers who can provide live, virtual and constructive technologies and capabilities that may be used alone or in conjunction with other technologies / systems to provide the required test capability.  Technologies of specific interest include electromagnetic interference (EMI) emitters capable of replicating the various contributors to the electromagnetic spectrum of specified geographical urban environments; transportable urban structures and facades, which replicate specific global urban areas and replicate the electronic absorption/reflection characteristics of the representative buildings and building materials; technologies to emulate/simulate/create a GPS-denied environment; technologies that enable tracking of troops and vehicles within the various challenges posed by an urban environment; data fusion capabilities to provide decision-ready information/results; and comprehensive test instrumentation/Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS) to collect and transmit all environmental, player-unit, and system-under-test performance and TSPI data.  In addition there may be a need to better define the Electromagnetic Environment (EME) characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, strength, range, etc.) for various emitters in the projected future theater urban areas as to their source, profile, and aggregate effects and impacts on performance of US systems and technology.   Commercial and non-development solutions are preferred where the end-system would provide the capabilities stated above.  However, developmental efforts to acquire currently unavailable technologies are invited.  PM ITTS is interested in suppliers who can provide a completely integrated capability, as well as those who can provide separate component capabilities.  All respondents are asked to provide the following:<BR><BR>1. A technical description of the potential solutions or complete capability.  The description should answer the following:<BR>a. What part of the overall capability does your solution address?<BR>b. How does your solution work?  What are its limits?<BR>c. What are the physical dimensions and weight of your solution? <BR>d. Has your solution been used in similar test and evaluation requirements? Where has this application been applied?<BR>e. What evidence supports your solution is applicable if it has not been used in similar test and evaluation requirements?<BR>f. How mature is your system?  Is it new development?  Is it already in production?  Does a prototype exist?  Is it similar to previous successful developments?  Is it an extension or evolution of an existing product? <BR>g. How much of the design will be an integration of commercial components? What type of components are parts of your solution?  What part of the solution has to be developed?<BR>2. An estimated schedule from contract award to operational capability.<BR>3. A cost estimate to produce the initial capability and any cost reductions for additional capabilities.<BR>4. Recommendations where performance can be traded for reduced costs or can be added for little or no cost.<BR>5. Identification of inconsistencies in the draft TCRD and any unrealistic requirements? The Government may accept some, none, or all of the comments provided to the draft TCRD.<BR>6. Identification of critical technical/cost/and schedule drivers.<BR>7. A description of the contractors familiarization of TENA requirements.<BR>8. A detailed approach to logistics management.<BR>9. Any history of sustainability costs of the proposed system solution. <BR>10. Identification of any areas that need science and technology development.<BR>11. The Govt has not finalized the parameters of the acquisition approach and is interested in soliciting industry perspective on the most effective means.  The Government may consider a single or multiple prime contractors to support the effort.  In your response, please provide your recommendation as to contract type along with your reasoning as to that selection.  <BR>12. The acquisition strategy mentioned earlier is in the beginning stages.  One of the items that the Government is considering is a statement of objectives approach.  This would require each contractor to respond with a SOW as a part of the eventual proposal that would address the objectives.  Please, include your perspective as part of your response to the RFI, the pros and cons as you see them, as well as your experience and if your company would recommend this approach or not.<BR>13. Contractors shall indicate if they are a large or small business (if small, please indicate any applicable socio-economic status such as Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a), etc.), if they are interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, and if they are planning to team with other companies for this contract.<BR>     14.  If a small business and intending to prime this effort, please answer the following:<BR>a. If you are expecting to prime this effort, can you meet the limitations of subcontracting, as stated in FAR clause 52.219-14?  If so, how?<BR>b. Due to the delays that occur in the DFAS system, do you have enough resources to continue without payment for 60 to 90 days?<BR>c. Have you ever been a prime contractor on something of this complexity and of a similar nature?  If so please describe effort.  What dollar value?  Length of time?  In terms of the JUTC, how long would it take you to obtain the appropriate resources?<BR>d. How you propose to meet the Non-manufacturer Rule (FAR 19.502-2) which states that the Small Business must be the manufacturer of the end item being procured (and the end item must be manufactured or produced in the United States) or it must obtain the product from another Small Business?<BR><BR>RFI Purpose and Limitations:<BR>The Government desires to better understand the current state-of-the-art to determine the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government is receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked.  There is no limit on the length of your submission.  Formal white paper shall include a cover letter.  In addition, you may include up to five attachments consisting of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center has a requirement for the Office of the Secretary,  Emergency Care Coordination Center (ECCC).  The ECCC is seeking to establish a system that can accept, combine, and display the information that is currently being collected by hospitals throughout the country.  The system would be capable of processing this data and then graphically displaying it so that trends could be identified and analyzed. The collection and display of this information would provide valuable situational awareness for emergency medical managers, hospital staff and administrators, and the academic community.  Administrative data elements such as ambulance diversion, patient wait-times, and ED census can be used as markers for the relative strain on emergency departments.  Currently, many emergency departments utilize electronic information systems in order to record patient data, track hospital wide trends and measure efficiency. These systems provide a wealth of information to hospital managers and aid in making decisions such as resource allotment and staffing levels. While this data is extremely useful, it is largely limited to in-house systems, where the data collected is not shared beyond the individual hospital.   

OBJECTIVES
This requirement is Phase 1 of a potentially multi-phased project.  The purpose of Phase 1 is to obtain the services of a vendor to design, develop, and demonstrate a stand-alone web-based system that will collect near real-time data from a minimum of five hospital emergency department information systems (EDIS) and display that data in a web-based graphical interface that will allow for end-user initiated data queries which produce graphical representations of the data, suitable for the identification and analysis of various trends.  The system shall not increase the workload of healthcare providers or otherwise intrude in daily hospital operations. The system shall collect pre-selected emergency department data from a minimum of five pre-identified EDIS without requiring additional manual input from providers (i.e., online survey forms).   Phase 1 also includes a limited demonstration of capability using data from a minimum of five EDIS.   

The Complete Statement of  Work will be posted in approximatly 15 days after the posting of this synopsis.  The requirement is being solicited and awarded under Part 12, Part 13 and Part 15 of the Federal Acquisiiton Regulation and FAR CIR.2005-32.  A Time and Materials Labor Hour contract is anticipated.  The solicitation is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The period of performance is anticipated to be a 12 month base period.

<DESC>****SUBJECT PROJECT MAY POSSIBLY BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA).  IF SO, APPROPRIATE ARRA CLAUSES WILL BE INCLUDED IN SOLICITATION.

The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a quality contractor for the “Recovery” Roof Replacement at the Abingdon Federal Courthouse in Abingdon, Virginia.  

This project is to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract.  Funding for contract award for the Roof Replacement project is currently not available.  Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to availability of funds which may be appropriated by the “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act”.  All costs associated with proposal preparation in response to this solicitation are the responsibility of the offeror.  Should no award result from this solicitation, the Government shall have no obligation to pay any costs to the offeror.

The awarded contractor will provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment, and shall plan work schedules and coordination. The work includes but is not limited to the following:  provide all construction services necessary for the removal of the existing built up roofing system, repair of existing brick masonry, provision for new rubber pavers, installation of EPDM roofing membrane and standing-seam metal roofing system as well as installation of new roof accessed metal stairs and platform.  The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The period of performance for this project is one hundred and eighty (180) days.  The estimated cost of construction is between $550,000.00 and $750,000.00.  

This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238160.  The award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, an award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors.  

The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  (1.) Past Performance Experience and (2.) Key Personnel Qualifications.    Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.     

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical 
and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will 
be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a).  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  An award may be made without discussions.  

This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice. 

A Pre-proposal conference will be held at the Abingdon Federal Courthouse in Abingdon, VA.  The date and time will be posted via modification to this announcement.

<DESC>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center-Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, intends to issue a sole source modification to Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-W204/P00020 for spares with Time and Materials (T&M) line items for services with General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), to increase the contract ceiling from $20,000,000 by $5,000,000 to $25,000,000 and extend the contracts ordering period from 30 June 2009 to 31 December 2009 to enable additional Delivery/Task Orders (DOs/TOs) to be issued for depot level and field support services on a T&M basis only for the Common Ground Station (CGS) and Joint Services Workstation (JSWS).  The CGS is a tactical data processing and evaluation center that links multiple air and ground sensors, to include the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft, to the Army Battle Command System at Echelons Above Corps, Corps, Division, and Brigade nodes. The CGS integrates imagery, video, and signal intelligence data into a single visual presentation of the battlefield, providing commanders with near real-time situational awareness, enhanced battle management and targeting capabilities. The JSWS provides similar capabilities, but it is not self-contained as is the CGS and it has limited communications capabilities (it primarily consists of CGS automated data processing equipment in transit cases).  The Government does not posses complete, detailed and current technical data for CGS and JSWSs that would be essential for any other source to be able to produce form, fit, and functionally interchangeable spare parts to ensure the effective operation of the CGS and to provide the required support services.  This sole source modification is authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and 10USC2304(c)(1).  No formal Solicitation will be issued for this modification.  Solicitation Number W15P7T-09-R-W431 is being used for reference purposes only.<BR><BR>The US Army, CECOM LCMC has established the IBOP website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry.  All parties interested in doing business with CECOM LCMC are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at htts://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics. Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.

<SUBJECT>Research and Development Sources Sought for the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Renewal
<SOLNBR>SS-NHLBI-HV-09-23
<RESPDATE>070209
<CONTACT>Jeffrey A Williams, Phone (301) 435-0338, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R & D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement.  Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.

Background
The National Heart, Lung , and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is interested in renewing the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) registry contract for a data coordinating center to manage a registry of advanced heart failure patients receiving FDA-approved, durable, mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs).  INTERMACS is a national registry created to advance the understanding and application of mechanical circulatory support in order to improve the mortality, morbidity, and quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure.  It is a collaboration among NHLBI, FDA, CMS, clinicians, scientists, and industry.   To date there are 96 centers participating and over 1700 patients enrolled in the registry.  
As many as 600,000 patients in the US have advanced heart failure, and the numbers are growing.  Therapeutic approaches have changed little over the last few years and include: drugs, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and pacemakers.  Patients whose heart failure progresses to later stages of heart failure have options limited to medical management, transplantation or mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) therapy.  INTERMACS data serve to facilitate the refinement of patient selections to enhance clinical management with current devices, and guide and expedite clinical trials for new indications and/or new devices.
  
Purpose and Objectives
The goal of the proposed program is to continue and expand data collection of advanced heart failure patients receiving mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD) collected through the existing Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS).  This will provide detailed data on advanced heart failure patients treated with FDA-approved, durable MCSD devices throughout the United States.  
All patients receiving MCSDs at INTERMACS certified sites are entered into the registry database.  Information on patient demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters, outcome measures, hospital and device performance, as well as blood and tissue samples are collected and stored.  The program is supported by an INTERMACS Data Coordinating Center.
 
Project Requirements
1.	Develop and implement a business plan that integrates non-federal government support for the INTERMACS enterprise on an increasing scale so that at the end of five years the NHLBI contribution to maintain the registry would be significantly reduced. 
2.	Maintain and support the existing Steering Committee structure and function including: representation from the NHLBI Project Office, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a study chair designated by the NHLBI, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) Principal Investigator, Co-investigators, and members from representative participating hospitals; and the current and future Subcommittees and their activities.
3.	Provide travel arrangements for meetings to be held at least twice per year.  And prepare and distribute minutes of these meeting.
4.	Maintain and support certification and monitoring of hospital performance. 
5.	Maintain and support regulatory requirements for patient privacy and good clinical practices.  
6.	Serve as the repository for clinical data and provide oversight for the collection and processing of blood and/or tissue specimens. 
7.	Provide statistical analysis of the data.
8.	Prepare and distribute quarterly reports for participating hospitals to include patient recruitment in various categories, status of follow-up data, data compliance and other data as agreed between the sites and the DCC.
9.	Provide both standard and specialized quarterly data reports to the Federal partners (FDA, CMS and NHLBI).
10.	Provide quarterly individualized industry data reports to collaborating companies.
11.	Provide a semiannual and annual summary report of the Registry to the NHLBI.
12.	Coordinate and support meetings and conference calls and prepare and distribute minutes of the meetings.
13.	Plan and conduct an annual conference for Registry collaborators and other interested investigators to present and review MCSD registry data.
14.	Prepare interim limited access data sets, consistent with NHLBI policies.  And provide interim data sets to NHLBI approved investigators.
15.	Provide a final consolidated copy of patient data in hard copy and computerized disc formats, along with the supporting documents.
16.	Perform site visits with record audits to determine the accuracy of web-based data submitted and information contained in source documents.  Develop a plan for monitoring of INTERMACS hospitals over the 5 year course of the contract.
17.	Work with participating hospitals and investigators to prepare for publication abstracts and manuscripts resulting from the Registry.
18.	Develop a plan for extending research collaborations beyond the current INTERMACS investigators.
19.	Develop and implement a plan to expand the pediatric component of INTERMACS in collaboration with outside organizations and other NIH programs. 
20.	Develop and execute procedures to make INTERMACS data collection software and associated documentation transportable for future government use. 

Anticipated Period of Performance
A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated with an award date on or about June 1, 2010 and a period of performance for five years.

<CONTACT>Ida J Lirette, Email ida.lirette@ars.usda.gov
<DESC><p>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service intends to issue and award to the AVESTIN, Inc 2450 Don Reid Drive, Ottawa, ON, Canada, KIH lEl on a sole source basis. Award will be made pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>&nbsp;REQUIREMENT: The Emulsiflex-C3 is a high-pressure homogenizer that can process samples as small as 10ml and yet has the flexibility to process up to 3 L/hr. Rice products are used to prepare emulsions to encapsulate oil, nutraceuticals, flavors or phytochemicals. A high-pressure homogenizer is needed to generate emulsions with a particle size from 10 nm to 1000 nm to get good encapsulation efficiencies of nutraceuticals, flavors, aromas, or phytochemicals. Since processes often need to be scaled up, the flexibility to cover a large range of process volumes is important. The membrane support system for EmulsiFlex-C3 allows continuous filtration/extrusion of liposomes and emulsions following homogenization. This is the only homogenizer that can work with this range of capacities.</p>
<p>Unique Qualifications: The purchase of the Emulsiflex-C3 from AVESTIN, Inc 2450 Don Reid Drive, Ottawa, ON, Canada, KIH lEl is justified for the following reasons: (1) the Emulsiflex-C3 is a unique instrument. It requires only a small sample volume and has a low retention of product, less than 1 mL. (2) The EF-C3 is capable of 30000 psi, direct-drive, and runs off single-phase power (115V). (3) Only the Avestin Emulsiflex has the continuous filtration/extrusion membrane support capability that allows production of liposomes and emulsions following homogenization.</p>
<p>The Emulsiflex-C3 shall be installed, delivery FOB, to the USDA, ARS, SRRC, New Orleans, Louisiana. <br /><br />Responses are to be received within 15 days (noon CST, July 2, 2009) of this notice. The NAICS Code/Size is 423490. This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. No solicitation will be issued. Questions can be e-mailed ida.lirette@ars.usda.gov.</p>

Background:

This project will entail the use of Chromatin –Immunoprecipiation (ChIP-seq), RNA, and micro-RNA (RNA-Seq and micro-RNA-Seq) massively parallel sequencing on the Illumina GAIIx platform.In an effort to catalog all epigenetic marks in mammalian cells, the NIH recently launched the Epigenome Roadmap. This initiative supports the production of reference epigenome maps in a variety of primary human cells or cell lines. A major challenge in epigenetic research not covered by the Roadmap however is the elucidation of how individual histone modifications contribute to the establishment and maintenance of other epigenetic marks. Another important but unsolved question relates to how individual histone modifications regulate cell differentiation, from stem cells to fully differentiated states. Determining the physiological function of histone modifications in mammalian cells has been particularly difficult because genetic deletion of histone or DNA modifying enzymes nearly invariably results in embryonic lethality. We propose to address these questions by first mapping the epigenomes in human hematopoietic stem cells, B, T, NK, skeletal muscle and retinal pigment epithelial cells and identify intrinsic epigenomic features. We next propose to investigate the mechanisms that establish these epigenomes by deleting in those same cells critical histone modifying enzymes including PTIP, which trimethylates lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3), EZH2 (H3K27me3), TIP60/TRRAP (H4K16 acetylation) and SIRT1 (H4K16 deacetylation). By integrating this large amount of epigenomic data using statistics and bioinformatics models, we hope to uncover how the epigenome contributes to cell differentiation as well as any potential crosstalk between different epigenetic modifications, a critical issue that has not been addressed so far. The strength of our proposal is that it joins the efforts of multiple groups with documented expertise in the area of epigenetics to survey histone modifications and understand their role in cell differentiation using well-established biological models. Typically, there is little motivation to systemically compare and contrast lessons from diverse systems. As a trans-NIH initiative, this project will have the advantage of bringing together investigators with different expertise to consider issues that will likely supersede their individual efforts. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   The sole source determination is based on the need to continue on-going experiment; changing variable would disrupt the outcome of the experiment.    Therefore an award to any other source is not feasible nor practical. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 10 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Inquires to this notice,  referencing number NHLBI-PB-(AR) 2009-205-RCO may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6144, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rosie C.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  There is no solicitation document available.  This is a notice of intent of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), for maintenance for GeoTrust software.   Software maintenance includes reasonable technical support and periodic updates/releases to the software.  GeoTrust is available on SEWP, however, it will be acquired from Northrop Grumman I.T., Inc. via the AACES Prime Vendor Contract V200P-909.  AITC has an existing GeoTrust licensing agreement through NGIT for all GeoTrust products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  Please reply no later than June 24, 2009 to Sylvia Thomas at Sylvia.Thomas2@va.gov.

<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Schedule B requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-02-H-5003. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a Brand Name requirement. No or Equal proposal will be accepted. Multiple awards may be accomplished if any items are determined to be unbalanced.<br />The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following:</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: SyncSort Backup Express (BEX) Advanced Recovery for Exchange. This is an add-on component to the existing software.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 (1 Each) SyncSort Back up Express Exchange Mailbox Recovery 1500 pack</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 (1 Each) Support Services Fee (Base year)</p>
<p>CLIN 0003 (1 Each) Support Services Fee (Option Year One)</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 (1 Each) Support Services Fee (Option Year Two)</p>
<p>This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval:</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Marine Central Command (MARCENT) currently utilizes SyncSort Backup Express for bare metal restore capability. BEX Advanced Recovery for Exchange (ARE) is an add-on component to the existing software that enhances the capabilities with no additional training or hardware investment required. Similar products from other vendors would still require additional training investments and would not necessarily be compatible with the existing backup infrastructure. To replace all existing recovery solution backups will a different one so the additonal software could be purchased at the start of the procurement would far exceed the cost of just the additional software. The additional cost to the government would exceed the amount of this request; furthermore, substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br />Original purchase costs for SyncSort were approximately $95K (three years ago), and we have spent an additional $30K over the last 3 years on administrator and user training. Conversion to a new system that would perform all the same tasks at this point would cost us the new purchase price (approx $100K), plus initial $20-$30K for administrator training to get us up to speed</p>

Different investments and systems may support distinct screening and watchlist activities for people, cargo, and tangible goods.  Credentialing encompasses all activities that determine a person’s eligibility for a particular license, privilege, or status, from application for the credential through issuance, use, and potential revocation of the issued credential.

16.5	Accessibility Requirements (Section 508 Compliance)
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220), August 7, 1998, requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities. Federal employees and members of the public who have disabilities must have access to and use of information and services that is comparable to the access and use available to non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public.
No Applicable Technical Standards were determined for this work statement.  This acquisition has exceptions to Section 508 that will be applied.
Exceptions for this work statement have been determined by DHS and only the exceptions described herein shall be applied. Any request for additional exceptions shall be sent to the COTR and determination will be made in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. DHS has identified the following exceptions that may be applied:

36 CFR 1194.3(e) - Fundamental Alteration, applies to the portions of this work statement where the item requires changes to comply with Section 508 and would render the acquired item useless for its intended purpose. After reviewing the business needs for this work statement, the acquired or developed product is meant to provide information through sight, sound and text concurrently in order for a user to interpret collectively.  In order to comply with Section 508, supporting the functional performance criteria would render this product useless and thereby fail to support business requirements.  DHS has authorized this exception for the imaging system within this work statement.  In addition, the training provided was determined to be a simulated effort to the imaging system with the same requirements and is thereby authorized to apply this exception.

36 CFR 1194.3(b) – Incidental to Contract, all EIT that is exclusively owned and used by the contractor to fulfill this work statement does not require compliance with Section 508. This exception does not apply to any EIT deliverable, service or item that will be used by any Federal employee(s) or member(s) of the public. This exception only applies to those contractors assigned to fulfill the obligations of this work statement and for the purposes of this requirement, are not considered members of the public.

36 CFR 1194.3(f) – Back Office, applies to any EIT item that will be located in spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair, or occasional monitoring of equipment. This exception does not include remote user interfaces that are accessible outside the enclosed “space”.

SECTION C   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1 BACKGROUND

The 20th Century was a time of increased technological and societal change for the transportation planning community.  Innovations such as GIS, GPS, remote sensing, and ITS monitoring technology have provided the transportation professional and the general public a potential overwhelming wealth of information about personal travel, goods movement and system performance.  While rapid change in the field of transportation is not unprecedented, the increase in information and ability to analyze and display information may be.

At the same time, understanding and responding to transportation needs has become greater and more complex.  The transportation system in the United States continues to serve an increasing population and even faster increase in vehicle travel.  More areas have become urbanized and some of the fastest growing areas are in smaller urban areas.  Both personal trips and goods movements are more diverse in origin and destination, time of day, and purpose.  The transportation system serving these increasing needs is aging.  At the same time, there is increasing consideration of other societal goals in the development of transportation programs, from promoting environmental stewardship to incorporating local community involvement.

The role of transportation planning is changing to emphasize the movement of people and goods as well as environmental, social, economic, land development, and financial parameters of alternative futures.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is being asked to assist the transportation community in addressing these issues within a transportation schema. This is reflected in the FHWA research agenda – crosscutting and multi-disciplinary in response to the issues facing planners today.

Within this context, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), and closely related legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) charge FHWA and transportation planning at all levels of government with meeting the complex demands of identifying and responding to future transportation needs. In particular, SAFETEA-LU promotes the assessment of multi-modal transportation needs and the analysis of the transportation, environmental, economic and social impacts of proposed investment and operational alternatives in support of decision-making.  Because of this, the research universe the FHWA operates in is fluid, dynamic, and flexible. To realize its research, development and technical assistance objectives, FHWA requires the support of multi-disciplined contractor teams to meet the challenges of transportation planning as we continue into the twenty-first century.

C.2 CONTRACT OBJECTIVE

The indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity task order contracts resulting from this request for proposals are intended to give FHWA and its U.S. Department of Transportation partners the flexibility to address a number of issue areas without specifically identifying each required task for the life of the contract.

This work should draw on the outcomes and final report from the Get Outdoors Anchorage Working Summit as well as participating organizations’ planning/program documents, such as the Municipality of Anchorage’s Parks and Recreation strategic plan currently underway.  Key Outcome:  Actionable agreements and timelines that, ideally, integrate into the three-to-five year strategic plan.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-190-DDC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33 (6/15/2009).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services from Bruker Daltonics Inc., Manning Park, Billerica, MA 01821 for the following:

1.	Part Number: ultraflex™extreme TOF/TOF MALDI-TOF System: MALDI-TIME-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer for accurate mass determination and structure identification of bio-molecules.

2.	Part Number: 256583, Biotools ™3.2 software package: Consist of the following; BioTools software serves as a tool for the identification and detailed characterization of proteins and peptides after mass spectrometric analysis.  This includes database search of single spectra and combined MS and MS/MS datasets, loading back of search results and further evaluation by looking for modifications and mutations.  The software must also supports extensive de-novo sequencing by the RapiDeNovo module which allows for de-novo sequencing of single spectra or the batchwise handling of multiple spectra. As well as supporting various types of top-down analysis techniques for intact protein characterization and provides sophisticated tools for annotation and database search of these data.  Must include CD, manual and one license each for BioTools and RapiDeNovo, quantity one (1) each. 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Laboratory of Biochemistry has a need for a Burker Daltonics ultrafleXtreme system for N-terminal sequencing technology. Edman sequencing technology will not be supported in service and parts in less than four years.  There is an urgent need to replace this dated technology.   Edman sequencing has been indispensible for a number of applications:
•	Identification of proteins from emerging diseases which are not in databases, and therefore not amenable to routine protein ID via mass spectrometry.
•	Identification of modified N-termini on proteins and peptides.
•	Quality control of expressed proteins used for vaccine production or X-ray crystallography analysis.
An additional need, never successfully addressed by any technology is C-terminal sequence information.  The Bruker MALDI Tof/Tof would address and overcome these problems.  This instrument has the capability to give sequence information from both the N-terminus and C-terminus.  In addition, proteins which are N-terminally modified can be successfully analyzed, and disulfide bridges can be mapped with this instrument.  The instrument must have the following capabilities:
1)	     MALDI-Perpetual ion source with cleaning in minutes based upon laser irradiation
2)	TOF Analyzer for linear and Reflectron mode measurements

e.	> 28,000 for ACTH 1-39 (m/z 4,539) FWHM
9)	Reflector mode mass accuracy:
a.	< 5 ppm with external calibration
b.	< 1.5 ppm with internal calibration
10)	TOF/TOF mass accuracy:
a.	Average mass error < 0.05 Da for the relevant fragments of [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B (m/z 1,570)
11)	TOF/TOF fragment resolution:
a.	> 1,500 for [Glu1]-Fib fragment m/z 175
b.	> 2,500 for [Glu1]-Fib fragment m/z 684
c.	> 3,500 for [Glu1]-Fib fragment m/z 1,056
d.	> 4,500 for [Glu1]-Fib fragment m/z 1,441
12)	Linear on-axis detector for improved performance
Performance Requirements on representative data:
1)	 Provide Top Down Sequencing data for a 25 kDa surface antigen showing at least 45 amino acids from the N-terminal and at least 30 amino acids from the C-terminal in a single MS analysis
2)	Provide Top Down Sequencing Data for Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase A showing at least 24 amino acids from the N-terminal and at least 41 amino acids from the C-terminal in a single MS analysis
3)	Provide TOF/TOF data (T3 Sequencing) on an ion generated by In Source Dissociation (ISD) for low mass detection of immonium ions

Software Requirements:
1)	Must supply automated software for the labeling and identification of Top Down Sequencing data.
2)	Must be able to accommodate non-standard amino acids
The Bruker ultrafleXtreme is the only instrument available which is capable of filling these needs. Therefore, it is to the Government’s best interest to purchase the Bruker Daltonics ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TO/TOF instrument.

Market research was conducted by the Government has determined that there were no small businesses available to supply the requested instrument.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns and operates DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada. It is intended for these aircraft to be operated in support of critical marine mammal surveys on the North Slope of Alaska throughout the summer and fall. Due to extreme weather conditions in the Arctic regions and other areas of Alaska, it has been mandated by the NOAA aircraft operations risk management (ORM) process to require the Twin Otter aircraft be kept in a hangar during the period of September 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009. The hangar will protect the aircraft from the environment as well as protect the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post flight activities in the harsh environment.</p>
<p>SCOPE: The contractor shall provide heated hangar space for one (1) DHC-6 Twin Otter, having a wing span of 65 feet and 19 feet high at the tail. Heated hangar means that the hangar is maintained a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Flight crews shall have access to the aircraft 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Contractor can determine if access will be available using on-site personnel that are available at any time, or if not available, issue keys to the flight crews for the hangar where the aircraft is stored.</p>
<p>NOAA DHC-6 Twin otter aircraft will be operating out of Barrow, Alaska in support of marine mammal surveys in the Chukchi Sea. There will be a NOAA Twin Otter mechanic in Barrow supporting the aircraft at all times except for short periods when the mechanic's services are requested to support aircraft in other locations. Only one Twin Otter is requested to be in the hangar at one time, however, if maintenance or equipment installation is required, there may be a request to shift one aircraft out on the ramp to allow another one access.</p>
<p>Security Clause 1352.239-73 does not apply to this SOW and a Security Accreditation Package is not required. The following services are requested as part of the hangar fee. If there are extra charges for these services in addition to the fixed base hangar rental fee, provide separate pricing quotes for each item:</p>
<p>a) Ground support equipment use including:<br />a. DC external power unit<br />b. Ground service equipment on an as needed basis<br />c. Tow vehicle for aircraft movement in and out of hangar<br />b) Hangar amenities including: tools equipment, consumables, phones, heat and DC power<br />c) 24-hour access for maintenance and flight crew<br />d) Access to office space, to include internet, phone/fax/copies<br />e) Small storage space in hangar for extra gear and equipment 5 ft x 5 ft<br />f) Acceptance of Multi Service Air Card for incidentals</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Hangar space is required for the Twin otter aircraft while operating in Barrow, Alaska during the period from September 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009 with an option for September 1, 2010 through November 30, 2010. The Government may exercise the option 60 days before September 1, 2010. However, the Government reserves the right to depart early from the survey site without incurring fees or penalties associated with departing earlier than November 30, 2009 and November 30, 2010.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT OWNED PARTS: At the conclusion of the lease, Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government.</p>
<p>INSURANCE: The contractor shall at its own expense, provide and maintain liability and hull insurance of not less than $2,000,000.00 to cover the aircraft in the event of fire or any catastrophic damage due to the hangar resulting in loss or damage to the aircraft. The contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained along with a copy of the insurance certificate. Written documentation is required to be presented.</p>

EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.  
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written order in response to the vendor's quotation will be e-mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor.  The Contracting Officer may ask the vendor to provide written acceptance of an order.  In other circumstances the vendor may indicate acceptance by proceeding with the services ordered.
Quotations will be evaluated as follows:
a)  Technical capability - Written Technical submittalb)  Past performancec)  Price
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FACTOR   
The company and its systems shall demonstrate its capability to meet or exceed the minimum requirements listed in this scope of work including the mandatory thirteen environmental training classes listed in Attachment J-1800000-03 and the three criteria below:
1.	The courses available will be evaluated on technical accuracy in accordance with EPA, other Federal standards and regulations, and Final Governing Standards (FGS).  The thirteen mandatory courses must be made available via a web site link for a minimum of five people who will validate the course content.  User IDs and Passwords shall be provided for this review.  Testing, grading, certificates, reports, and summaries shall be available for the reviewer for validation and evaluation.   
2.	IT and System components such as server capacity, hardware, software, ease of use, and technical support for your system and its 24/7 availability worldwide will be evaluated.
3.	Administrative support and help desk capability, data collection and reporting for metrics on use and surveys, and your quality control procedures to support your system in accordance with the SOW will be evaluated.  
Note If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendor's Written Technical Submission is "unacceptable," that vendor's entire submittal may be determined to be technically unacceptable and may no longer be considered for further competition or award.  
PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance will be evaluated after the Contracting Officer has completed the technical evaluation. The Contracting Officer, however, reserves the right to exclude vendors whose technical submittals have been determined to be unacceptable from further evaluation of past performance and price.  Additionally, in the event a vendor submits a technically acceptable quotation with a non-competitive, high price when compared to the government estimate and/or other technically acceptable quotations, the Government, at its discretion, may not evaluate that vendor's past performance submission and eliminate that vendor's quotation from further evaluation and consideration for award.  
The Past Performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106.
The Government will determine whether the vendor's past performance submissions are, in order of preference, relevant, somewhat relevant or not-relevant contracts based on three factors: scope, complexity and magnitude.  
Relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of all three factors.Somewhat relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of some of the three factors.Not-relevant - the past performance submission fails to meet the criteria of all three factors.For past performance submissions determined to be relevant or somewhat relevant, the Government will make a reasonable effort to collect and evaluate past performance information from the point(s) of contact identified by the vendor or, at the discretion of the contracting officer, other points of contact.  The vendor acknowledges that the Government is not responsible if the point of contact provided by the vendor fails to respond to the Government's past performance inquiry.  Vendors are also advised that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government, including Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS).  
The Government will evaluate the vendor's Past Performance in order to assess performance risk.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a vendor's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information.  
Vendors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. However, the submittal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the quotes of other vendors having an acceptable (or better) past performance. 
PRICE
The vendor's proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.  
Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.  
SELECTION
The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Subpart 13.1.  The Government shall select the vendor whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, considering price and other factors (technical submission and past performance) when compared to other quotations.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced vendor.  The Government also reserves the right to not award a contract if a contract award is not in the best interest of the Government. 
Please direct questions to Jen McDonald at (757) 322-8154 or jen.mcdonald@navy.mil.
Vendor(s) must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter’s technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.

Factor 1-Technical Capability: Technical capability subfactors: Quotations will be evaluated on the vendor's ability to: 1. Provide the required services on the dates requested. 2. Meet the minimum requirements regarding lodging, meeting space, food and beverage service, audio visual equipment and technical support, business center requirements, reporting requirements, and the vendor's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility as it relates to lodging and meeting space.; and 3. Provide a centrally located facility with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, local restaurants, and other area attractions. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the hotel complex and the surrounding area.  Quotations must address the quality of the customer services provided, and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities.  

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The vendor must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for similar work awarded within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of federal, and/or state and local government agency or other non-government client; 2. Name, titles and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements.  

Factor 3 – Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the independent government cost estimate. 

Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter’s technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.

Factor 1-Technical Capability: Technical capability subfactors: Quotations will be evaluated on the vendor's ability to: 1. Provide the required services on the dates requested. 2. Meet the minimum requirements regarding lodging, meeting space, food and beverage service, audio visual equipment and technical support, business center requirements, reporting requirements, and the vendor's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility as it relates to lodging and meeting space.; and 3. Provide a centrally located facility with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, local restaurants, and other area attractions. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the hotel complex and the surrounding area.  Quotations must address the quality of the customer services provided, and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities.  

Factor 2 - Past Performance: The vendor must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for similar work awarded within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of federal, and/or state and local government agency or other non-government client; 2. Name, titles and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements.  

Factor 3 – Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the independent government cost estimate. 

Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award.  The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSTS07-09-R-000148, which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This requirement will be an unrestricted acquisition.  The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  Services anticipated beginning on or about July 15, 2009.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range shall be within a 20 mile radius
of the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  

The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:

DHS personnel will use the range 36 days per quarter.  DHS requires exclusive use of the range in 8 hour blocks, and limited blocks in the evening for night/low light shooting.  The range will be closed to the public (non-law enforcement) during the corresponding hours that DHS uses the range.  Should weather (e.g. rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range; DHS will have priority in rescheduling those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month, if not possible. DHS will provide all ammunition, targets, and firearms instructors.  The estimated number of rounds fired per year is 750,000.  

The range may be indoor or outdoor.  Indoor ranges must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA regulations.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess and maintain all target retention devices.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 15 and 25 yard-line courses of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it, e.g. wood.  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas.  The range must possess a public address system that will allow the Range Officer to communicate with range instructors and students, who are participating in training.  The range will have a designated firearms cleaning area.

The range rules will allow students to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules will not disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, such as tactical move and shoot drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive.  Range rules will not disallow students from performing multiple and rapid-fire drills.  

A (DHS owned) CONEX box is required to be stored at the range site, in a secured area where the public does not have access.  Special targets, aircraft seats, range and other equipment deemed necessary will be stored in this unit.  There will be no additional cost to DHS for the storage of this CONEX box.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

(1)  Agency and Contracting Activity – U.S. Coast Guard, ALC C-130 Long Range Surveillance  Branch, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, presents this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

(2)  Nature and/or Description of the Action being Approved. – Approval is requested to procure, on a sole-source basis, contracted purchase of HC-130J Video and Mission Processor (VAMP) Embedded Switches.  These are commercial items that will be procured utilizing the procedures in FAR Part 12.  The proposed contractor is Curtiss Wright Controls Embedded Computing (CWCEC) the original equipment manufacturer of the Switches.  Price analysis is based on a May 2009 Quote.

(3)  Description of Supplies/Services – The requirement is to provide Switch sparing for the VAMP installed on the C-130J aircraft mission system IAW VAMP drawing number 7407100 to ensure system compatibility with C-130  J aircraft .  The total estimated value of this procurement is $106,700.00 for a total of 20 switches.

(4)  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. – 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(5)  Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited. – CWCEC is the original equipment manufacturer of the Switches.  This is the only known firm who can provide approved spares, repairs, engineering design changes, and product improvements.  CWCEC owns the rights to the proprietary data, specifications and drawings necessary for performance and has the staff and extensive experience necessary to maintain and improve Switch performance/reliability. 

(6)  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential 
 sources as is practicable.  A combined synopsis/solicitation will be submitted via Federal Business Opportunity upon approval of this J&A.  CWCE is the only known OEM authorized for this procurement.

(7)  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government
 will be fair and reasonable.  It is the Contracting Officer’s opinion that prices listed in the CWCEC quote for this procurement will be fair and reasonable based on a comparison to commercial prices, a comparison to historical pricing information on similar items, and an analysis of other than cost and pricing data.

(8)  Description of Market Research.  Market research was conducted by researching Fed Log for additional suppliers and contacting CWCEC for distributors.  Since CWCEC is the only firm owning the rights to the proprietary technical data required for performance, additional competition is not expected.  Any other feasible source would have to build or modify existing equipment utilizing CWCEC drawings that are proprietary and cannot be provided to third parties.  

(9)  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition. All of the data, specifications, manuals, and drawings necessary to perform this requirement are proprietary to the OEM. CWCEC is the only firm who has the technical data necessary to produce the required spares, repairs and approved replacement parts necessary for VAMP performance.

(10)  A Listing of the Sources, if Any, Which Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.    A combined synopsis/solicitation will be submitted via Federal Business Opportunity upon approval of this J&A.  If any responses are received, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors.

(11)  A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required.  In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, ALC established the New Product Development Branch (NPD).  Subsequently, a representative of the NPD Branch was reassigned to the HC-130 Product Line.  This representative has the responsibility to locate alternate sources of supply/services and alternate acceptable products.  Engineering, contracting and NPD representatives continuously conduct market research to ensure that companies interested in doing business with the USCG are given every opportunity to compete for our requirements.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC><p>Effective with this amendment, posted on 17 June 2009, the entire full text clause (i.e. 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items Jan 1999) currently included in the solicitation is hereby revised by deleting paragraph 2, "Price: The Government may or may not award to the lowest-price proposal. For this requirement, all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best combination of technical capabilities and proposed price (i.e. the best value)".
<p>The following revised full text clause replaces the previous clause: FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Technical - the capability of the services being offered to satisfy the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The offeror shall provide with his/her offer sufficient documentation, specifically addressing subparagraphs 1.1 thru 1.5.4 of the PWS, para 1.0 (Description of Services). The accompanying documentation must be adequate to enable the Government to reasonably evaluate offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements of the PWS. The Government shall evaluate offeror's total proposal for evidence of offeror's demonstrated understanding of both the specific tasks and substantive issues included in the PWS, including how offeror has demonstrated his/her ability to provide MEONet, EEONet, and Unit Climate Assessment with offeror's current capabilities with direct URLs to connect.<br />2. Lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA): An award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Provision</p>

<DESC>Due to the number of questions received it has become evident that the specification is deficient in addressing the Government's requirement.  The requisitioner has requested that this action be cancelled until such time that he can review all the questions, plan and prepare for the production of the video taping.  It is not invisioned that this action will be procured with Fiscal Year 2009 funds.  The requisitioner plans to submit a new Statement of Work that addresses all the received questions next Fiscal Year.  The next Fiscal Year 2010 begins October 2009.

Set-aside determinations will also be reviewed with any new Fiscal Year 2010 procurment request from the requisitioner.  Names of interested venders will be retained and if the vendor meets the size and (if applicable) social economic set-aside determination, that vendor will be contacted.

I thank you all for your interest and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you and your staff.

<DESC>This notice is hereby amended to address the following vendor questions/answers and to extend the due date for quotes thru June 22, 2009:

Question: In item #7 following section “O”  asks for: “Measurement Range of at least 80m”, however, the optic specified in sections “N”  and “O” are not applicable to 80m measurement capability.

Answer: The maximum distance requirement should read 8.0m.

Question: Similarly, linear measurement also begs straightness, that is, the measured results will not define the entire length condition without straightness, however, no straightness optics have been defined. Was this an omission?

Answer: We do not need Straightness optics for a maximum distance requirement of 8.0m.

Question: Item “5”  states: “Resolution of at least 1nm;”  Is this specification correct? The measuring accuracy requested in item “2” –“Measuring accuracy of at least +/- 0.5 parts per million (ppm)” is not particularly tight in light of the resolution specification.

Answer: If the "Measuring accuracy of at least +/- 0.5 parts per million (ppm)" is true for the whole range from micro scale to macro scale it will be technically acceptable. For example in the case of 15 micro meters range of motion the corresponding measurement accuracy should be  = +/- 7.5 pico meters. In the case of 8 meters range of motion the corresponding measurement accuracy should be  = +/- 4 micro meters.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential offeror.

Question (1) The question posed previously has an "or" in it, so our question now is to which part of the question does the answer "Yes" apply?  (Previous Question: Similarly for the Hydrocarbons, can the individual CxHy species be measured separately, or only as "total hydrocarbons as CH4"? 
 
Answer:  Either method is acceptable.  Whether that is provided by the instrument as the concentration of individual species or a conglomeration of hydrocarbon species represented as CH4, we would like to report the concentration of total hydrocarbons present in the exhaust stream.   Simply reporting the concentration of CH4 alone in the exhaust is not acceptable.  
 
Question (2) There is no mention of absolute concentration of water (H2O) in the exhaust streams to be measured, and this can have dramatic measured results for the constituents whose LODs have been specified.  (a)  What is the highest absolute H2O concentration expected and (b) what are the ranges of absolute H2O concentrations expected in the exhaust streams to be measured?

Answer:  Micro cogeneration devices aim to remove as much heat from the exhaust stream as possible to increase the amount of heat they can deliver to the application.  As most are based on combustion of natural gas, there is a significant amount of water in the exhaust, and since they remove much of the heat from the exhaust, often the exhaust gas is nearly saturated with water.  Assume that the highest water concentration is saturation at 50 °C and atmospheric pressure.  Assume that the lowest water concentration is a humidity ratio of 0.08 kg water per kg dry exhaust, which translates to about 16% RH in a 90°C, 1 atm exhaust stream.  Although, the exhaust stream will more likely be near saturation.  Additionally, there is the potential for the exhaust to cool further in the vent stack, which could cause condensation.  Efforts have been taken to insulate the exhaust vent to inhibit condensation.
 
Question (3) Do the requirements for analyzing O2 at the LOD of 0.01%, from a technical point of view, necessitate a paramagnetic O2 analyzer (more expensive, but better for lower concentrations of O2 and a faster response time than ZrO2 based O2 analyzers), or is the ZrO2-based O2 analyzer sufficient (response time ~ 30s)?  

Answer:  The specific technology that measures the oxygen concentration is not important.  A response time of 30 seconds is acceptable.
 
Question (4) How is the exhaust to be treated after it passes out of the exhaust gas analyzer into the mechanical space that is temperature controlled?  There will need to be some means to extract the exhaust from the mechanical space, correct? 

Answer:  If the flow stream through the instrument is unable to be fed back into the exhaust stack, a vent line can be installed up to the roof.  The vent line would be approximately 3 meters in length.
 
Question (5)  Based on the statement given to the question about temperature and pressure ranges of the exhaust gas streams "The facility will be used to test many different micro-cogeneration systems", what are the purge conditions that have to be met to insure complete elimination of exhaust constituents from the gas analyzer between analysis of exhaust gas streams resulting from each different micro-cogeneration system"?

Answer:  The facility only has the capability to test a single micro cogeneration device at one time.  Therefore, no switching or purging sample lines is required.

All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation are unchanged and remain in full effect.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Government is

data required to update the Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">1.0<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">BEA has developed several
satellite accounts designed to expand the analytical capabilities of the system
of national accounts. Included among these is the Travel and Tourism Satellite
Accounts (TTSA&rsquo;s), which are used to determine the economic size of the U.S.
travel and tourism industry.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">BEA is updating the TTSA&rsquo;s
for calendar year 2008. In order to create the 1997-2008 TTSA&rsquo;s, BEA is seeking
the same set of data (updated for 2008) that was supplied by D.K. Shifflet
&amp; Associates, Ltd. (DKSA) to create the 1997-2006 TTSA&rsquo;s during calendar
year 2007. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Since continuity of data is
crucial to accurately estimating the TTSA&rsquo;s, the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) anticipates the award of a Sole Source contract to D.K. Shifflet &amp;
Associates, Ltd. If this contractor is not used as the supplier for this data
purchase, BEA will be required to procure the data for the preceding nine-year
period (1997-2008 inclusive). This would be necessary in order to provide a
consistent time series over the entire life of the TTSA&rsquo;s.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The TTSA&rsquo;s are funded by the
International Trade Administration (ITA), which requires that the TTSA
estimates be a consistent, comparable time series from 1997-2008. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="a" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The primary goal of this
contract action is to obtain the most comprehensive data as appropriate inputs
consistent with the data provided to BEA for the past seven years for the
TTSA&rsquo;s.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Government intends to award a noncompetitive
contract under the provisions set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation
Part 6.302-1, <strong>Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services
will satisfy agency requirements</strong>, as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The lack of competition for
this procurement action is due to the Bureau of Economic Analysis updating the
TTSA&rsquo;s for calendar year 2008.<span>&nbsp; </span>BEA is
seeking the exact same set of data that were supplied by D.K. Shifflet &amp;
Associates, Ltd. (DKSA) to create the 1997-2006 TTSA&rsquo;s for calendar year
2007.<span>&nbsp; </span>The primary goal is to secure the
best, most comprehensive data as appropriate inputs consistent with the data
provided to BEA for the past seven years for the TTSA&rsquo;s.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Continuity of data is
crucial to accurately estimating the TTSA&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp; </span>If D.K. Shifflet &amp; Associates, Ltd is not used as the sole source
for this data purchase and this contract must be competed, BEA will require the
data to be provided for eight years (1997-2008 inclusive).<span>&nbsp; </span>This is necessary in order to provide a
completely consistent time series over the entire life of the TTSA&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp; </span>The TTSA&rsquo;s are funded by the International
Trade Administration (ITA) and requires that the TTSA estimates be a
consistent, comparable time series from 1997-2008.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Furthermore, use of another
vendor to recreate the 1997-2008 time series would result in a substantial
duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through
competition, and would create an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s
requirements.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">For
these reasons, the Government knows of only one source capable of providing the
required supplies at the desired level of quality.</span></p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER SUSTAINMENT, RESTORATION & MODERNIZATION ACQUISITION TASK ORDER CONTRACT (SATOC).
"In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this presolicitation notice of intent to issue a task order under an established Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with the Prime Contractors presently assigned to the Sustainment, Restoration & Modernization Acquisition Task Order Contract (SATOC) which is operated by HQ AETC CONS LGCT office, c/o HQ AFCESA CONS CEKC at Tyndall AFB, FL.  
This project calls for Replacement of Water Plant Boost Pumps at Dover AFB, DE, as stated in the presolicitation title.  The Government intends to issue a task order to one of the Prime Contractors under the SATOC IDIQ.  The Prime Contractors' main point of contact is listed on the attached SATOC Prime Spreadsheet (see attachment). Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact the companies listed from this form.
The purpose of this project is to replace four electrically-driven pumps and associated motors located in a centralized pumping station.  Two of the pumps use 60-hp-drive motors and provide 1,400 GPM at a nominal system pressure of 60 psi.  The remaining pumps use 40-hp-drive motors and provide 700 GPM at a nominal pressure of 60 psi.  Replacement will consist of equipment of similar technical specifications and high-efficiency components in pursuit of Air Force energy initiatives.

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO ANNOUNCE TO CORRECT SET ASIDE,  NAISC CODE, PSC CODE
This is a total small business set-aside procurement under NAISC classification code: 325320,  and PSC: F006    .  The small business size standard is 500 employees.
Scope of Work:  Project to treat exotic, invasive plants in the Swanson Oil and Gas FieldBackground:  There are now 110 exotic plant species recorded on the Kenai Peninsula, of which 43 are considered invasive and 63 occur on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.  A survey by Refuge staff on 29-31 August 2007 revealed at least 32 exotic plant species growing on pads, roads, tank settings, and right-of-way corridors within the Swanson Oil and Gas Unit.  As many as 14 different exotic plant species occurred on some pads.  Observations of yellow sweetclover, common tansy, and cattail within the Swanson Unit are the first and only sightings of these species on the Refuge.  In addition, two hawkweed species (Hieracium caespitosum, Hieracium umbellatum) found within the Swanson Unit are particularly aggressive invaders and appear to be spreading from the northernmost pads including the area of planned access for the East Satellite project. White sweet clover (Melilotus alba), another aggressive invader which is being dispersed throughout Alaska by vehicle tires, is well distributed within the Unit.  Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), which potentially threatens the Swanson River, also occurs at several sites within the Unit. There is a small window of opportunity to control and perhaps even eliminate these species from the Unit through the use of herbicides and better management practices.
Proposed treatments:  There are at least 175 acres on 60 pads that are infested with hawkweeds, white and yellow sweetclover, and reed canary grass.  In addition, there are several infestations along access roads and power lines outside the pads themselves, including at least 5 acres of reed canary grass distributed in seven colonies.  The most comprehensive approach is to visit and treat infested areas of all 60 pads and the roads that connect them for a period of two years and a third only applying foliar products.  This scope of work addresses only the first year (2009).
Herbicides to be used include Roundpro to treat reed canary grass on approximately 15 acres; Transline as a foliar application to treat hawkweeds and sweet clover on approximately 120 acres; and Casoron on approximately 40 acres as a pre- emergent applied in the spring before plant green up and seed germination (see attached table for application rates).   Other chemicals may be considered as warranted.
The herbicides will be applied with a surfactant or carrier to help the herbicides to set and penetrate the stem and leaf surface.  The pads will be graded as early in May as possible in order to apply the pre- emergent so the product can break down and set; the pads may also have to be watered down after the pre-emergent is applied to prevent run-off.   In June or July, the hawkweeds will be treated with a foliar application which also acts as a post and pre-emergent.  The reed canary grass will be foliar treated in spring and weed wacked and foliar application in the fall. The white sweet clover will be treated in May through September with both post and pre-emergent. 
Responsibilities:  The contractor will be certified by the State of Alaska (DEC) as a pesticide applicator. The contractor will be responsible for preparing, transporting, and storing and applying all chemicals.  The contractor will provide their own application equipment including backpack sprayers, holding tanks, and appropriate safety equipment.  All treatments will be applied in a timely way and in coordination with appropriate staff at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KENWR).   KENWR will be responsible for pre- and post-treatment monitoring to assess efficacy.  

Table 1.  Four EPA-registered berbicides and two surfactant proposed for use on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.  A target species refers to a plant species of competing vegetation that is controlled in favor of desired species. A non-target species refers to any plant, animal, or organism that a method of application is not aimed at, but may accidentally be injured by the application.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes. To accomplish this, NHTSA collects and analyzes motor vehicle crash data and develops, promotes, and implements educational programs, vehicle safety standards, research, and enforcement programs. 
Data suggest that sobriety checkpoints in combination with publicity can be effective in reducing crashes.  However, sobriety checkpoint programs have not achieved a significant general deterrence effect when examined in terms of program awareness, self-reported behavior change, and perception of increased likelihood of being stopped by the police and arrested.  There is a need to improve general deterrence so that enforcement programs can be more effective and the crash reduction effects sustained.  There is a need to improve the visibility of enforcement programs.

Description: 

The objective of this requirement is to assess the effectiveness of an earlier checkpoint start time and accompanying signage in raising public awareness of sobriety checkpoint activity and raising the public’s perceived risk of an alcohol-impaired driver being stopped and arrested.  This requirement will include eight (8) tasks: (1) Final Refined Work Plan, (2) Recruit Sites, (3) Prepare for Baseline Telephone Survey, (4) Prepare for On-Site Intervention Activity, (5) Conduct Telephone Surveys, (6) Implement Sobriety Checkpoint Intervention Activity, (7) Brief NHTSA on Results and (8) Submit Final Report Deliverables.  All work required including preparation, submission, review, and acceptance of the final report shall be completed within thirty-two (32) months after the effective date of the contract.
The NAICS Code for this contract is 541720.  It is the Government’s intent to award a Cost plus fixed fee type contract for a performance period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months.  It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted. The estimated date for release of the solicitation is on or about June 29, 2009. 



Period of Performance: Thirty-six (36) months starting on or about 9/3/2009.



RFP Number: DTNH22-09-R-00220



Contract Award:

NHTSA intends to issue a full and open, competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) with the intention of awarding a Cost plus fixed fee  type contract for a performance period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months.  All questions regarding this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail to sherese.gray@dot.gov no later than July 6, 2009.

ISSUANCE DATE:	June 16, 2009
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	July 19, 2009, 4:30 pm Cairo time
POSITION TITLE:	Regional Development Outreach & Communications Specialist
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the 
		required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
Although the position requires extensive travel to the Middle East, the incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.


B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Regional Development Outreach and Communications Specialist will be supervised by, and will report to, the Deputy Director of the OMEP office (Office of Middle East Programs) at USAID/Cairo, Egypt.

C.	OVERVIEW:
The Regional Development Outreach and Communications (DOC) Specialist is located in the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) at USAID/Cairo.  The DOC Specialist reports to the Deputy Office Director of the OMEP Office, but will have extensive interaction with the various USAID Mission Directors in the Middle East region, stretching from Morocco to Iraq.  S/he maintains regular contact and collaborates with the DOCs in bilateral USAID Missions and with relevant U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officers (PAO) to ensure that Embassy personnel, including senior staff, are properly apprised of USAID regional public activities and projects.  S/he also serves as principal liaison with USAID’s Bureau for Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) in Washington (USAID/W).  

USAID manages over $1 billion of the U.S. Government (USG) development program across the Middle East region.  The USAID portfolio includes a broad range of economic growth, democracy, and social sector program activities.  

The Regional DOC Specialist supports USAID in the achievement of its objectives by producing and disseminating public information about regional Middle East activities for transnational and country-specific consumption, in collaboration with USAID bilateral Mission DOCs.  The Regional DOC is responsible for collecting, investigating, managing, and distributing information associated with USAID’s regional Middle East program.  The Regional DOC serves as OMEP’s primary point of contact and liaison for public and media information inquiries.  The Regional DOC also serves as the primary contact for USG interagency regional outreach and diplomacy efforts in the Middle East, and as the primary USAID outreach contact for USAID non-presence countries in the region. 

The Regional DOC Specialist is also responsible for designing and managing regional media programs that support USAID’s regional strategic goal of promoting a culture of democracy.  

USAID activities in the Middle East are complex and politically sensitive.  In this capacity, the incumbent is responsible for strategically planning, developing, implementing, and administering the regional DOC program to promote better awareness and understanding of United States foreign assistance to the region, along with related policies and achievements, among key audiences of the host country, in the United States, and throughout other donor countries.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

Duties and Responsibilities of the Position	% OF TIME

a.  Regional Coordination of USAID Mission DOCs in the Middle East 	15%

Responsible for the overall coordination and regional aggregation of outreach and communications efforts in the 7 USAID missions in the Middle East from Morocco to Iraq, and the regional Office of Middle East Programs.  Coordination includes tracking outreach and communications activities in all USAID-assistance in the Middle East, synthesizing like activities into a regional message of USAID assistance to the Middle East, providing “surge” assistance, as needed, to bilateral USAID missions planning and executing large scale outreach or communications activities, and reporting to Washington (LPA and ANE) on emerging trends and high profile activities.  

b.  USAID Regional DOC Strategy:	20%

The Regional DOC develops, reviews, and implements USAID's Middle East Communications Strategy, in coordination and consultation with the bilateral USAID missions’ outreach strategies.  The goal is to promote USAID’s new regional Middle East program to external and internal audiences, while also facilitating information access and sharing amongst the bilateral missions and regional program, and strengthening the missions’ reporting functions.  The Regional DOC also incorporates the USAID role in non-presence countries into the regional communications strategy.

An important aspect of this responsibility is for the Regional DOC to be a counterpart in USG interagency efforts for regional communications and diplomacy in the Middle East.  The Regional DOC will carry out a liaison role, as well as provide USAID input to interagency efforts, and to communicate back to other USAID missions and offices.

The DOC strategy should take into account the cost/benefits of particular inputs to outputs, to optimize communications tools and distribution to the broadest audiences possible.  The incumbent counsels OMEP on the selection, targeting, and placement of potential DOC materials in keeping with USAID's Strategy.

The DOC must also take into account the need to identify and focus on key sectors that have a natural appeal to local interest as well as USG policies; the importance of ensuring that publicity material used will be non-controversial; and that the material is visually appealing, well-defined, and contains a human interest element.  S/he will also be responsible for putting in place policies and procedures for OMEP communications that clarify roles and responsibilities within the USAID and inter-agency community, as well as with implementing partners, including templates for various communications tools, standards for creating and finalizing DOC materials, and guidelines for planning and managing events.

This may include arranging interviews, briefings, working with USAID bilateral mission DOCs regarding tours of USAID projects and escorting journalists; and keeping records of activities.

2.  Keeps abreast of USAID events to ensure that appropriate press coverage is provided.  Advises OMEP staff if press coverage is not recommended for any culturally sensitive event.   

3.  Reviews the daily press to keep abreast of coverage that relates to USAID activities; advises OMEP of the same.

4.  Plans, researches, drafts, and/or edits press releases and fact sheets for USAID/OMEP.

5.  Advises and works with USAID bilateral mission DOCs and various embassy PAOs to expand opportunities for coverage of USAID assistance, including TV and radio.  Helps USAID technical offices define appropriate candidate activities for coverage, participates in field inspections and final selection, and accompanies TV/radio crews to site locations for filming. 

d.  Manages Regional Media Programs:	15%

1.  Designs regional media programs.  This includes, but is not limited to, programs that build the professionalism of media, encourage diverse voices and perspectives, and strengthen regional media networks.

2.  Manages existing and new media programs, including monitoring and reporting on performance and addressing implementation challenges in coordination with partner organizations.

3.  Contributes to annual budget and performance reporting processes.

Coordinates field travel and public affairs activities of the OMEP personnel, as well as (when appropriate and in coordination with USAID bilateral mission DOCs) U.S. Ambassadors and other senior inter-agency officials for USAID events. Prepares schedules and briefings in collaboration with OMEP staff and arranges for photo/video and media coverage as appropriate.  Acts as the primary USAID coordination point for public events regarding USAID’s role in non-presence countries.  

3.  For site visits or events that involve the senior U.S. officials, ensures that all information related to the events (e.g., backgrounders/scene setters, schedules, talking points, speeches, etc.) has been prepared, meeting quality standards and time requirements.

4. Coordinates signing ceremonies, inaugurations, and/or dedications of USAID regional projects, including drafting press releases for placement in the Middle East press and on the USAID homepage as well as coordinating with appropriate OMEP, other USAID, and inter-agency officials on logistics, schedules, guest lists, seating,  and other arrangements related to the events.

<DESC>RESPONSE TO QUESTION:
Q: Can we use another chiller manufacturer instead of Trane for the Carson City Chiller Replacement Project (Solicitation GS-09P-09-KSC-0049)?
A:  A Trane chiller was used as the basis of design.  However this is a "Trane or equivalent" specification.  The selection will be considered in the evaluation, to include sources of maintenance and the degree and impact of having to use multiple sources of maintenance (the remaining unit is a Trane), which will be weighed against price.  Offerors are invivted to submit alternate proposals, each of which will be considered.

<DESC>Following are comments from the GSA structural engineer regarding design review expectations.  This pertains to the construction document submittal that will be required of the awardee (not proposal requirements):

Although the proposed chiller and the existing chiller weigh approximately the same amount, the proposed chiller will have a different weight distribution, a different footprint and a different bolt pattern.  In addition, the proposed chiller will be installed per the requirements of a different and more current Building Code. 

In terms of structural design, I would expect to see calculations that verify that the existing roof framing has the capacity to resist a combination of vertical and lateral forces that are specified by the 2006 International Building Code, Section 1613 and the ASCE Standard, ASCE/SEI 7-05, Section 13.6, “Mechanical and Electrical Components”.

In terms of structural drawings, I would expect to see structural plans, sections and details that will illustrate the complete and final installation of the new chiller unit that are based upon the manufacturer's recommendations for installation of their product and the strength requirements identified by the Engineer-of-Record's structural calculations.

I will be expecting a submittal that contains these structural drawings and structural calculations, including the vendor's catalogues that pertain to the new chiller, for review and approval.

<DESC>RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS:

Q1:  The existing Trane chiller nameplate requires a maximum of 200-amp
overcurrent protection, however it is currently fed from the MCC with
the original 225-amp breaker. Are we going to be expected to bring that
chiller up to code also? Do we want to A. reduce the size of breaker, or
B. install a fused disconnect with 200-amp fuses? 
A:  We will require the contractor to evaluate and make recommendation to GSA as to whether to replace this breaker.  An amendment will be posted requiring this. We will not require the contractor to do this work unless a subsequent price adjustment is negotiated.

Q2:  Will we be expected to have an electrical engineer review and sign off
on this project?
A:  Yes, final design documents need to be stamped by a PE for each applicable discipline.

Q3:  Are we expected to replace or reuse the existing heat tape on the
chilled water piping?
A:  Heat tape on the existing piping being reworked can be reused to the
extent possible or replaced with new.  The intent is to provide a
properly operating system when complete. 

Q4:  In the specs I noticed we are to install 2 new control valves one for each
chiller. Do you have a spec for these or is the controls contractor going to
provide the control valves for us to install?
A:  The new chiller specifications already provides a "manual" butterfly valve
reference.  GSA will contract separately for a control contractor to provide a pair of matched
actuators, for both chillers, that will operate with their output scheme for
any butterfly valve configuration, this in lieu of having the mechanical
contractor provide a new control valve for both the new and exiting
chillers.

Q5:  Is this a taxable project?
A:  GSA as a federal agency is tax exempt.  However this only applies to taxes levied directly against GSA.  Taxes which a contractor must pay as part of its costs may be included in the bid price.

Q6:  Are bid/performance bonds required for this project?
A:  Yes.  A bid bond for 20% of the amount bid must be submitted with proposals.  This will be returned to unsuccessful offerors at time of award, and to the successful offeror on receipt of payment and performance bonds (which must be for 100% of contract price).

Q7:   Do you request just a standard proposal with the job scope for the Bid Submittal?  If so, do you want included with the proposal equipment specifications (i.e.… performance, dimensional, weight, etc…)
A:  Look at "Instruction to Offerors" starting on page 11 of the statement of work (near the end of the solicitation document, following the standard clauses).  This itemizes exactly what is required.

<SOLNBR>M6785409R8104
<CONTACT>Graham K. Oliff Jr. 407-380-8152
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide industry submitted questions and Government answers.
Q1.  See Paragraph 3.3.10.1 and Appendix A of the Performance Spec.  Appendix A indicates that the C15 ET trainer must simulate the following malfunctions under the heading Perform Maintenance on the Engine Lubrication System: 1) Diagnose the cause of excessive oil consumption, 2) Diagnose the cause of low oil pressure, 3) Diagnose malfunctions in the oil pressure indicating system.  Paragraph 3.3.10.1 does not list these failures.  Is the C15 ET trainer to simulate these three faults or not?  If so, what specific faults that would cause these symptoms does the Government  want the C-15 trainer to simulate?
A1.  All the training tasks (including malfunctions) identified in Appendix A of the performance specification shall be provided/performed using the C15 Engine/Transmission trainer.  The government is still evaluating/determining the specific faults that will be simulated for each type of malfunction. 
Q2.  See Paragraph 3.3.10.1 and Appendix A of the Performance Spec.  Appendix A indicates that the C15 ET trainer must simulate the following malfunction under the heading Perform maintenance on battery system: 1) Diagnose a faulty battery system.  Is the C15 ET trainer to simulate this fault or not?  If so what specific fault that would cause this symptom does the Government want the C-15 trainer to simulate (for example dead battery, shorted cell, faulty alternator)?
A2.  See response to 1 above.
Q3.  See Paragraph 3.3.10.1, Cylinder Fault.  Specifically, what type of fault does the Government want to simulate as a cylinder fault ( low compression, blown cylinder, connecting rod, etc.)?
A3.  See response to 1 above.
Q4.  What type of LVSR technical documentation will be supplied as GFI during the RFP stage and after contract award?   Will -10, -20, -24, -34, etc. technical manuals be supplied.  Dimensioned drawings engine/ transmission compartment, driver's cab, etc.
A4.  Technical documentation for the engine and transmission components will not be provided during the RFP stage by the government.  Drawings for the GFP will not be provided by the government at any stage of the acquisition.  The government may provide the Operator and Maintenance manual for the LVSR, or applicable parts of the manuals related to the engine and transmission, to the winner of the contract.  VADS documentation will be provided to the winner of the contract.  
Q5.  Before or after contract award, will the competitors have access to a LVSR to take measurements, pictures, etc.?  Will there be an industry day to do this? 
A5.  The government intent is to provide access to an LVSR C15 engine and allison transmission before contract award for interested parties.  The date and location is still to be determined.  In addition, after contract award the LVSR engine/transmission will be available for access by the contract winner at a government designated location, if needed.  In both cases the components will very likely be mounted in the vehicle.  
Q6.  Does the Marine Corps have a budget for this effort that they can share with the competitors? 
A6.  The budgetary information will not be shared with industry.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - This modification is issued in support of the ADVENT program. The Recovery Act funds are for the ADVENT program R&amp;D for Operational Benefits Analysis (OBA) for Tactical Strike Mission Area. The contract was solicited and awarded using competitive procedures which resulted in the award of this contract. The resulting contractual type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF). This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded per FAR 16.301-2.</p>

The GSA Contracts have the construction portion of roofing and the maintenance portion of roofing in two different schedules; therefore, the RFQ was modified to only cover the maintenance and inspection of the 18 designated roofs. The construction portion will be resolicited at a later date. This major change to the solicitation caused the initial closing date of 22 May 09 to be changed to 10 Jun 09. The requirement was for maintenance on 18 specific roofs located on Malmstrom Air Force Base (MAFB). In accordance with FAR 13.104, Promoting Competition, eleven contractors were contacted via eBuy to request quotes.</p>

<DESC>THE US DEPARMTMENT OF LABOR (DOL) OFFICE OF PROCUREMENT SERVICES (OPS) HAS ENTERED INTO AN 18 MONTH LABOR HOUR CONTRACT (BASE YEAR PLUS 6 MONTH OPTION) FOR PROCUREMENT SPECIALIST SUPPORT SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA).  THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN ISSUED AS AN SBA 8(A) SOLE-SOURCE UNDER THE PROCEDURES OF FAR 19.8.

Determination and Findings for Use of Other than Firm Fixed Price Contracts:

Upon the basis of the following findings and determination that I hereby make pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 16.6, the proposed contract described below may be entered into on a Time and Materials (T&M) basis.

Description of the agency requirement:  

The United States Department of Labor (DOL), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (OASAM), Office of Procurement Services (OPS), requires the support of a contractor to provide Contract Specialist support services in support of the acquisition process under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). 

Findings

1.   The proposed procurement calls for the services of a contractor to support contract pre-award, administration, and post-award activities, being funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). .  

2.   FAR Subpart 16.6 indicates that a Time and Materials contract is only appropriate when “it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate the extent or duration of the work, or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.”  At the time of award, neither the Program Office nor the Contracting Officer can determine the amount of support required with any reasonable degree of confidence. 

3.   A determination will be made prior to award, that the proposed contractor’s accounting system is adequate for the determination of costs applicable to the proposed contract, and the solicitation makes provisions for maintenance of adequate records and controls, including appropriate surveillance by Government personnel during the performance as to reasonably assure that inefficient or wasteful methods will not be used.

Determination

1.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3(b), this is not a cost-reimbursement contract for the acquisition of commercial items.

2.  It is impracticable to secure services of the kind or quality required, without the use of the proposed contract type.

3.  The estimated cost of the proposed contract is $3,500,000.00, which includes labor and materials for the period of a twelve (12) month base period plus a six (6) month option period.

<DESC>II.	NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED

The Office of Financial and Administrative Management (OFAM) is seeking contractual assistance for strategic planning for the entire range of hiring activities for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  OFAM has been tasked with providing critical administrative and financial support to ETA and the Department of Labor (DOL).  OFAM is responsible for ensuring adequate financial and human resources are available to meet the needs of ETA.

OFAM has a significant new task of hiring nearly 100 new personnel in 2009, and 133 personnel in 2010.  One hundred thirty (130) of these personnel are in the ETA Regional offices.  The remainder is in offices in the ETA headquarters.  The majority of these new personnel are needed to administer various provisions of the American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 (ARRA) that apply to the Employment and Training Administration.  Of this number 25 are related to changes in and expansion of the provisions of the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program.

A recent Departmental decision on TAA directed that its entire staff be in the federal civil service by July 2009.  This means that all current contractor staff positions must be filled with new hires, in addition to the number of new positions to be filled.


III.	DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
	
	The Contractor shall analyze ETA staffing requirements under the ARRA to test the reasonableness of the proposed strategy and timetable for moving forward.  The Contractor shall assist in developing an appropriate strategy for hiring, training, and diversity under the ARRA.  The Contractor shall assist the DOL with the efforts to conceptualize and comment on aspects of ARRA funding in regards to human resources actions.  The Contractor shall assist in developing an appropriate strategy to obtain input from within DOL, including the use of surveys, interviews, reviews of local rules and practices, and other research methods, in the effectiveness of the hiring practices in ETA regarding the use of ARRA funding.  The Contractor shall assist in evaluating the special problems and needs associated with phasing out the positions created by ARRA funding and if any positions should be retained on a permanent basis.
