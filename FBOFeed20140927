<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">In-service Inspection of Material Properties through Opaque Fluids and Liquid Metals in Hostile Environment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is conducting research and development into advanced in-service and inspection technologies for advanced reactor system with an initial focus on under-sodium viewing technologies. These technologies are required for the inspection through opaque fluids or liquid metals in a hostile environment, such as under inert atmospheres and high temperatures.</p>
<p>An innovative ultrasonic waveguide transducer technology is in development and testing at Argonne National Laboratory to provide a technology for the inspection of system and components through liquid metals, such as sodium, and other opaque fluids. This system uses an ultrasonic transducer situated on top of a low noise waveguide to provide a robust signal transmission and sensing through high temperature sodium at 350 &deg;C. The technology is still in development and, however, has been demonstrated to achieve in-sodium defect detection resolutions of 0.5 mm in both width and depth in real-time. In additional, the technology has demonstrated that it is capable of identifying components with circular surfaces and various 3D geometries.</p>
<p>Input from companies and vendors is solicited to understand potential areas of interest other than high temperature under-sodium viewing applications. Other potential applications may include metal and casting applications, geothermal applications, petroleum applications, nuclear waste and storage applications, etc. Besides defect detection and component identification, the technology can also be used for process monitoring and quality control of material properties, thickness, etc. Interested companies are preferred but not required to have experience and expertise in ultrasonic technologies, but should have on-line instrumentation and control capability or experience to integrate the technology with their process.</p>
<p>Argonne National Laboratory is seeking information, comments, feedback, and recommendation from interested parties to understand other potential industrial uses (besides under-sodium viewing) for the high temperature waveguide ultrasonic viewing technology that may lead to Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), or Work for Others (WFO) agreements.</p>
<p>For further information, please respond H.T. Chien at Argonne National Laboratories by email <a href="mailto:htchien@anl.gov">htchien@anl.gov</a><span>, partners@anl.gov</span> or by FAX 630-252-4901.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals or quotations received by the closing response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is for information only and is not a request for proposals or a solicitation of offers.

All prospective offerors are cautioned that in the event the Government is unable to determine price reasonableness based upon the offers received and market analysis, the Government will not issue a contract.
  This decision is solely the decision and the right of the Government.  All efforts performed and all costs expended by prospective offerors in providing information requested by the solicitation are not subject to reimbursement by the Government. 

The following FAR provision and clauses are applicable to this procurement:  
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

The quote shall demonstrate the Offeror’s familiarity with the detailed aspects of the requirements and shall clearly show that the Offeror correctly interpreted all of the requirements.
 Responses must adequately address specific RFQ requirements. Statements such as the Offeror understands and the Offeror shall/can comply along with responses that paraphrase the RFQ are inadequate. The use of phrases such as standard practices (with a specific government reference or industry reference) is unacceptable. Quotes submitted in response to this solicitation shall contain the information specified within FAR 52.212-2. Offerors are cautioned to not simply restate the specifications in their technical proposal.

As used in this clause? (1) ?Contract financing payment? and ?invoice payment? have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (2) ?Electronic form? means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests. However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer. (3) ?Payment request? means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.

(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The solicitation number is R454112420XM99 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-76. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334111 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside and only qualified offerors may submit quotes.

FOB Destination shall be Assault Craft Unit Five, MCB camp Pendleton, CA 92055-5161. The FLC - San Diego requires the following items(see line items 0001 - 005).

Destination applies <BR> <BR>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS (iii) PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii). In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE (S) AND FOB TERMS, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause) <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	23 Christopher Way
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      		
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed price (FFP) delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) for brand name Hewlett Packard (HP) hardware, ancillary installation and configuration services, and warranty support.  Hardware shall be delivered within 30 days after contract award with 36 months of warranty support.  Additionally, this effort shall include six optional tasks with hardware delivery 30 days after contract award with 36 months of warranty support, if exercised.  The total period of performance, if all six optional tasks are exercised, including warranty support will not extend past the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services: This action is to acquire brand name HP hardware, specifically an Enterprise Backup Encryption Solution for use within the Open Virtual Memory System (VMS) Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environments.  This action will provide hardware for all 45 required VistA sites and six optional sites that currently perform tape backups for their Open VMS VistA environments.  The proposed action is to provide HP hardware which allows for encryption of VistA system backup tapes at 51 Regional Sites that are not currently encrypted. Furthermore, VA requires ancillary installation and configuration services, and warranty support to ensure the HP hardware remains operational.  This will include ancillary installation; consisting of equipment delivery, installation in existing racks space, powering up of equipment, updating of firmware\microcode, and connection of equipment power cables.  The six optional tasks included in this effort are for additional sites and will include delivery of HP hardware, ancillary installation and configuration services, and warranty support.  The total estimated value of the proposed action is $ which is inclusive of all optional tasks.
 
4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR Subpart 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, the Government has determined that limited competition among authorized resellers of brand name HP hardware and services is expected for this proposed action.  The existing Open VMS VistA environments at all 51 VistA sites covered by this effort are currently operating on HP software and hardware that is proprietary in nature.  Any other brand name item other than HP, would result in various interoperability and compatibility issues with the existing OpenVMS VistA environment.  Specifically, the existing Open VMS VistA environments consisting of HP hardware and software communicate through a proprietary infrastructure that is only fully supported with HP brand name items.  Therefore any hardware must operate within the OpenVMS VistA environment, which is currently only fully supported by HP.  Furthermore, this requirement is an augmentation to the existing environment and must be supported by the current VistA maintenance contract which only supports HP equipment.  Due to a VA mandate to enable backup encryption, these VistA sites will need to be updated with new Tape Backup Libraries that support Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 encryption.  The proposed HP hardware has been tested and approved for operation within the Open VMS VistA environments.  Furthermore, any equipment other than the approved HP equipment would invalidate the operation and support of the existing systems through existing warranties and maintenance contracts.  The existing systems are critical "systems of record" and have been tested, validated and approved to operate the Open VistA VMS environments; furthermore they must be maintained by the existing support and must not be co-habitated with non-approved equipment.  Finally, only HP or an authorized reseller can provide the ancillary installation and configuration services, and warranty support because any source must have access to the proprietary hardware technical specifications to ensure the HP hardware is fully operational and configured properly with the existing HP items in the Open VMS VistA environments.
 
6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.  In addition, in accordance with 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), this Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity will be posted on the NASA SEWP IV website with the solicitation.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any products and/or source providers available that will enable future requirements to be competed.
8.  Market Research:  Market research for other sources/service providers for the requirements described herein was conducted in June of 2014 to determine if the current HP hardware and software being utilized in VA can be supported by other service providers.  While other sources do possess the general capabilities needed to perform the proposed effort, only HP can provide the necessary technical expertise and product base that functions within the Open VMS VistA and its current configurations to prevent the loss of crucial data and ensure the backup encryption requirements are met. Additional market research was conducted in June 2014 to ascertain if any other brand name hardware can meet VA's needs.  Specifically, another hardware solution that was researched was the Quantum iScalar 80, iScalar 500 and iScalar S6000 Tape Libraries and encryption key management systems.  The Quantum iScalar products are proprietary to their solution and are not compatible with the exiting HP OpenVMS VistA environments.  The final solution researched was the Spectra Logic Tape Library and encryption key management systems; it was discovered the Spectralogic product line is also not compatible with the exiting HP OpenVMS VistA environments. 

9.  Other Facts:  None.
