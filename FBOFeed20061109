<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) currently leases 43,815 rentable square feet of office space along with one-hundred (100) on-site, reserved, covered and secured parking spaces in Phoenix, AZ.  The GSA has an interest in leasing approximately 49,390 rentable square feet of contiguous office space along with one hundred and twenty (120) parking spaces of which one-hundred and two (102) must be on-site, reserved, covered and secured, ten (10) must be on-site, reserved and secured, and eight (8) must be underground and secured.  Rentable space must yield a minimum of 43,089 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet, of which, a minimum 9,000 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet must be located on the ground floor.  There must be a ground floor entrance for the use of the Government, which provides access to the offered space, separate from the main lobby entrance.  This separate entrance must eliminate the need for Government personnel to traverse the main lobby space when entering the building.  Space must be located in the Central Business Area in Phoenix, Arizona and within these boundaries:  North-Camelback Road; South-Jefferson Street; East-7th Street; and West-7th Avenue.  Space must meet the Federal Government?s standards for fire safety; seismic; accessibility; security, and must not be located within a 100-year floodplain.  The GSA is considering whether to remain in its existing leased space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this decision, the GSA will consider, among other things, the costs it would likely incur through relocation, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure costs, non-productive agency downtime, security and other appropriate considerations.  The parking, ground floor space and separate entrance requirements will be considered as go/no-go factors during consideration of possible alternatives.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single-source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Metron Aviation Inc. of Herndon, VA, which provides research, engineering and development support for the Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT) Program  (formerly known as the Collaborative Decision-Making Program) (CDM)), Systems Operations Programs Directorate, ATO-R. This contract will bridge a gap in contract support due to the fact that the current contract (NAT-0000-04-P200035/DTFANE-05-C-00007) expires November 30, 2006.  The current contract was originally expected to run for a longer period of performance; however, due to circumstances beyond the control of the program office, the support will be ending November 30, 2006.  Therefore, a single source contract for a  seven-month period of performance with an option for up to an additional three (3) months to allow for a possible transition to a new contractor is planned. The estimated total value of this acquisition is $3.3M. A follow-on competitive procurement (per the market survey notice of April 19, 2006) is planned for award by July 1,2007 with the possible transition period ending by September 30, 2007. It has been determined that it is in the best interests of the FAA to acquire these services from Metron Aviation for the following reasons: A contract vehicle that provides the specified services with the necessary level of contractor expertise is essential to the success of CATMT.   Benefits of CATMT research have led to procedural changes and tool development to proactively manage changes in Air Traffic Control (ATC) system constraints that has resulted in significant delay avoidance and cost reduction to airlines, and therefore to the traveling public.  Metron Aviation, Inc. is currently the sole provider of this support.   Failure to award this bridge contract by the expiration of the current contract will lead to an interruption in contract support.  This in turn will lead to an interruption in current CATMT activities meaning that the FAA ATO Systems Operations Programs Directorate will not be able to meet commitments that ultimately impact FAA Flight Plan Goals of System Safety and Capacity. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If you have any questions about or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer Mr. Tim Eckert no later than close of business Thursday, November 16 at the number specified above.

The government will not pay for any costs associated with the prepara tion of proposals nor travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal, including a signed original cover page, five (5) hard copi es, and one electronic copy in the form of one PDF file on a CD to:   Ms. Jina Saunders, SERDP Program Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821, 703-696-2127. No electronic mail or faxed copies will be accepted.  Pre-proposals m ust be received no later than 4:00 PM EST on Thursday, January 4, 2007. They must be in abstract form describing the merits and objectives of the proposers project. The abstract should concisely describe what the proposer has to offer the SERDP Program an d discuss (1) the proposed objective(s) and approach with a clear identification of overall innovation and scientific/technical merits; (2) the proposers capabilities and related experience, or unique combination of these which are integral factors in ach ieving a proposed objective; and (3) the qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), team leader(s), or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Pre-proposals should be no longer than five pages (not i ncluding the cover page), single-sided, and not less than 11 point. One attachment of up to three single-sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page must be completed and entered via the web site at https://sems.serdp-estcp.org in the fo rmat specified in the Instructions. At a minimum, the pre-proposals should contain: (1) a title, descriptive of the research to be performed; (2) the name and address of the individual, company or educational institution submitting the pre-proposal; (3) th e abstract of the technical objective and description of the approach including how the approach described satisfies the focused need in the SON; (4) the duration of the project along with a milestone chart with significant events; (5) the estimated labor cost, materials cost, burdens, and profit (if any) by year; and (6) a one page curriculum vitae for each of the Principal Investigators (not to exceed three) (CVs are not included in the five page pre-proposal count). Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation  by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information and may be encouraged to submit a full proposal by a set time and date. The format requ irements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on the DoD SERDP web site. Each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The pr e-proposal review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologies without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It is expected that awards totaling approximately $2.0 million will result. Pre-proposals and full proposals will be evaluated against the following factors, listed in descending order  of importance: (1) SERDP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission responds to high-priority, mission relevant, DoD and DOE environmental requirements as described in the SON; (2) the approach, objective(s) and overall scientific and technical merits  of the proposed technology; (3) potential for transition of the proposed research; (4) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed object ives; (5) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds; and (6) availability of other financial support for the proposed effort. For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcon tracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions.

<DESC>GS-03P-07-DX-C-0008 General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure a firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for a pavement repair project at the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Cheatham Annex in Williamsburg, VA.   It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through Full and Open Competition, utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures.  The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interest of the Government.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 238990.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.

The work includes but is not limited to the milling and/or removal of existing deteriorated asphalt roadways, driveways, and concrete pavement as well as associated site work to correct drainage problems, and installation of new paving.  The work shall be accomplished in a single phase.  The approximate duration of the contract is six (6) months, which will include one base item and have four options. FAR Clause 52.217-7, Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item may be included in this acquisition. The contract will also include the clause titled "Evaluation of Options" (FAR 52.217-5) except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interest.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The estimated cost for this construction project is between $1,000,000.00 ? $5,000,000.00.

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, ?Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process?.  As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; Factor 1) Firm shall list a minimum of five (5) projects completed in the past five(5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total contract value of at least $1,000,000.00. Submit a description of the project in no more than (2) paragraphs. Factor 2) Firm shall submit superintendent's resume demonstrating that he/she has 5 years of experience as a superintendent. 
Since the Contracting Officer has elected to utilize past performance as an evaluation factor the procedures detailed in FAR 15.305, ?Proposal evaluation?, shall be followed.  All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability but shall not be ranked using non-cost/price factors.

The RFP is scheduled to be available on or about November 24, 2006.  The subject solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified Building Information (SBU).  For reasons of security and before release of SBU information, the requestor must complete and sign the attached "Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors".  All prime contractors interested in submitting a proposal shall submit via e-mail a completed document security form.   As indicated, the form shall be filled out with the proper information including a photocopy of a valid business license, DUNS number, and IRS tax ID number.  This information shall be emailed back to Melinda M. Richardson at melinda.richardson@gsa.gov.  

Once the solicitation is available and the Security Form is received and verified, direction will be provided as to where the RFP, including plans and specifications, will be available. A Pre-proposal conference will be established in the near future.  Time, date and location will be provided in the solicitation.

Request for Construction Documents 
GS-03P-07-DX-C-0008

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.   SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.


REASONABLE CARE:
 
1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and


(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding
hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters, Aircrew Systems Program Office (PMA202) intends to procure by full and open competition the flotation assembly portion of the Helicopter Egress System for Passengers (HESP).  HESP will be used for Marine Corps troops being transported over water in rotary wing aircraft.  HESP consists of a flotation ensemble that includes the flotation assembly, emergency air supply holster and survival item pouch.  The flotation ensemble incorporates performance improvements over the current in-service flotation device, the LPU-32/P.  HESP will provide increased buoyancy and will integrate with the currently fielded Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and the new Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) and its single point release system.  The emergency air bottle and survival items are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and will not be part of the procurement.  The Government intends to award a single contract which will cover a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for the supplies and services anticipated herein is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing; the Federal Supply Code is 4220, Marine Lifesaving and Diving Equipment. The projected procurement quantity is 19,839 HESP units over the potential 5 year period, plus the associated documentation. The type of contract to be awarded shall be Firm Fixed Price, and the required delivery of these units shall be not greater than 4 months after award/exercise of option at an approximate average rate of 400 per month. Deliveries shall be received at designated government facilities throughout CONUS.

Interested sources who intend to compete for this solicitation must be able to demonstrate their ability to satisfy the form, fit, function, and interface requirements when worn by a fully outfitted combat ready Marine wearing either the OTV and MTV; meet operational and environmental requirements, demonstrate the ability to meet the production capacity and deliver sample units that do not require extensive modification or development.   Interested sources must also demonstrate their ability to provide spare parts and replacement systems through commercial sources as well as instructions on use, maintenance and repair.  Minimum capabilities should include the ability to provide 65 pounds of buoyancy; one size fits all; manual inflation of the flotation; a system that allows donning and doffing of the flotation, emergency air source (air bottle) and survival item pouch together as a unit.

Criteria for proposals received in response to this solicitation will be available in Section L of the forthcoming Request For Proposal (RFP). Evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be available in Section M of the forthcoming RFP. Offerors will be required to submit 5 production representative units with their proposal.  NAVAIR intends to conduct the evaluation of proposals utilizing the written proposals as well as the sample units. The Government will conduct testing on the 5 sample units.  Testing to be conducted will be listed in Section C of the forthcoming RFP.  After evaluations have been conducted, the Navy intends to down-select to one (1) responsible offeror who has best demonstrated the capability to produce the HESP in accordance with the performance specification and the stated evaluation criteria. A Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity of 30 systems will be purchased and for a fleet assessment to evaluate use of the system in an aircraft fully loaded with troop passengers.  Upon successful completion of the fleet assessment the full rate production contract shall be awarded.  It is anticipated that the initial contact award shall take place in or around March 2007.

NAVAIR intends to use Non-Government personnel in the source selection for this effort. Non-Government personnel will have the need to access proposals in order to support evaluation and selection for the Government. Therefore, before an award, it may be necessary for the solicited company to enter into non-disclosure agreements with these individual companies. A prerequisite for receiving a contract award will be registration in DOD?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by this agency. Questions with regards to this forthcoming solicitation shall be addressed by electronic mail only to Stella Obayuwana at stella.obayuwana@.navy.mil; no phone calls or faxes please.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The anticipated award date is November 30, 2006 for a firm fixed price contract. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Salt Lake City Field Office has a requirement for 2,250 bales of wood-strand erosion control material to be delivered to the Pilot Fire ICP location in Box Elder County, Utah.  The wood-strand erosion control material should be a wood based material specifically designed to be used for wind and/or erosion control with regard to Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation (ESR) and Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts, which require dense woody material that will hold on to steeper slopes and graded areas and will last more then one post-fire growing season. The wood-strand material will be used for aerial application to prevent erosion and lessen recovery time of land areas affected by fire.  The wood-strand erosion control material must be of the following specifications.  1. All material must be weed free. 2. Wood strands must be 4-6mm in width and of various lengths between 60-240mm. The thickness of the wood strands must be 2-4mm and each bale should consist of no more than 50% of any single length by weight. 3. The wood strands must be made from non-bark material and must be manufactured from materials that are visually inspected to be free of known insects and disease that could be transported to other locations. 4. Wood strands must be baled into 600-700 lb bales in the quantity specified above. 6. All bales must be held together by wire or synthetic twine. 7. Bales must be stored in a covered location and must remain dry throughout the period of production to delivery to the BLM. Stacked bales must be allowed to have air circulate to allow moisture content to decrease. DELIVERY: Delivery shall commence upon award of contract. Upon award of the contract, a minimum of 264 bales shall be delivered each week through February 7, 2007 until 2,250 bales have been delivered in total. Due to logistical concerns, deliveries may be made on only two of the five business days. The contractor is required to contact the Government Point of Contact two (2) business days prior to commencement of delivery to make arrangements for a BLM representative to be onsite to administer and oversee delivery at the said location and to make periodic inspections with regard to progress.

DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 should be submitted by 14 Dec 2006; FY 08 by 1 May 2007; and FY 09 by 1 May 2008.     White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 Oct 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.         

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that provide innovative technologies supporting the forensic analysis of Multiple Source Intelligence (Multi-INT) and persistent surveillance data, with a focus on information fusion and understanding.   

Objectives: 

The military requires an electronic evidence/intelligence investigative capability supporting the task of forensically examining Multi-INT data.   The objective of this effort is to develop automated or semi-automated tools for an analyst to perform this task.   The tools are focused toward discovering adversarial behavior within persistent surveillance data.  The intent is to find and perhaps predict enemy behavior by understanding their adaptable Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and responding prior to implementation.   

The developed capabilities may be transitioned to various programs, for example, the AF Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS-AF), the Aerospace Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System, National Intelligence Exploitation Capabilities (IEC) environment, as well as the Army and Navy DCGS systems (DCGS-A and DCGS-N).

Scope:

Under this BAA, the intelligence provided by Moving Target Indicator (MTI) is the primary, but not the sole focus.  The scope includes forensic analysis, behavior and movement pattern analysis, and the development of predictive capabilities.  This involves advancing the state-of-the-art in the area of information discovery, development, fusion, cueing, and delivery of Multi-INT derived intelligence.

Current forensic analysis is a manual and time consuming process measured in days not hours. Beginning with a request for information (RFI), the analyst needs to assemble a composite vision of the situation associated with an event(s) and location. The tools and techniques used by analysts are constrained to a few intelligence sources which limit the forensics capacity.   What is required is a set of Multi-INT forensic capabilities to automate this process across a variety of intelligence data sources.  Traditional sources include HUMINT - Human Intelligence, GEOINT - Geospatial Intelligence, IMINT - Imagery Intelligence, MASINT - Measurement and Signature Intelligence, OSINT - Open Source Intelligence, and SIGINT - Signals Intelligence (COMINT - Communications Intelligence, ELINT - Electronic Intelligence, and Special Signals).  

These tools need to provide core detailed understanding of surface vehicle movement allowing not only efficient product/evidence development, but also electronic sharing of products to anticipate future events in a Multi-INT environment.  The concept has been demonstrated during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), in that the technical feasibility and military utility of forensic and reasoning capabilities to detect, backtrack, and provide multi-INT cueing, supports the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) providing not only situational awareness, but also strategic awareness.  

Funding Area Opportunities:

This 3-year initiative will employ spiral development to include testing occurring in the AFRL Fusion Facility with prototype delivery at 9-month intervals.  Offerors should focus on technologies that have a significant impact on forensic analysis and that provide near-term release of forensic software tools.  Advances are desired in motion pattern analysis; behavioral pattern analysis, cueing, MTI changes detection/"normalcy" modeling, cross-cueing, resource allocation, advanced reasoning and prediction techniques.  These tools will be leveraged to determine the intent of entities or groups of entities based on terrain, doctrine, and historical data. The combination of these technologies will provide a powerful tool set for operators to exploit Multi-INT data and will enable the creation of a more comprehensive forensic picture. The development of inferential reasoning and predictive techniques based on prior templating that will support cueing anticipated Improvised Explosive Device (IED)-related events is also desired.  Examples include movement from caches, IED placement, convoy timing runs, triggering IEDs and escape to safe houses is also desired.

Technology areas include: MTI/Multi-INT tracking, Multi-INT database mining, rapid archival and retrieval capability, cueing/cross-cueing, Moving Target Intelligence (MOVINT) products & formats, and activity detection/identification.  Aspects of the research may include Kalman smoothing, finite sliding window averaging, Hough Transforms, Bayesian Nets, and fuzzy logic & predictive analysis (behavioral & motion patterns).  Predictive analysis, for example, involves finding terrorists prior to IED deployment and explosion by understanding their adaptable TTPs, and responding prior to implementation.   In addition, MOVINT technologies are of interest supporting the development of road usage statistics, route planning and interdiction, route deviation detection, mobility metrics, facility characterization (hours of operation, population, related locations/entities), and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) planning are of interest.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.0M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 07 - $750K; FY 08 - $1.5M; and FY09 - $1.75M.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters, Aircrew Systems Program Office (PMA202) intends to procure by Small Business Set Aside the flotation assembly portion of the Helicopter Egress System for Passengers (HESP).  HESP will be used for Marine Corps troops being transported over water in rotary wing aircraft.  HESP consists of a flotation ensemble that includes the flotation assembly, emergency air supply holster and survival item pouch.  The flotation ensemble incorporates performance improvements over the current in-service flotation device, the LPU-32/P.  HESP will provide increased buoyancy and will integrate with the currently fielded Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and the new Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) and its single point release system.  The emergency air bottle and survival items are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and will not be part of the procurement.  The Government intends to award a single contract which will cover a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for the supplies and services anticipated herein is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing; the Federal Supply Code is 4220, Marine Lifesaving and Diving Equipment. The projected procurement quantity is 19,839 HESP units over the potential 5 year period, plus the associated documentation. The type of contract to be awarded shall be Firm Fixed Price, and the required delivery of these units shall be not greater than 4 months after award/exercise of option at an approximate average rate of 400 per month. Deliveries shall be received at designated government facilities throughout CONUS.

Interested sources who intend to compete for this solicitation must be able to demonstrate their ability to satisfy the form, fit, function, and interface requirements when worn by a fully outfitted combat ready Marine wearing either the OTV and MTV; meet operational and environmental requirements, demonstrate the ability to meet the production capacity and deliver sample units that do not require extensive modification or development.   Interested sources must also demonstrate their ability to provide spare parts and replacement systems through commercial sources as well as instructions on use, maintenance and repair.  Minimum capabilities should include the ability to provide 65 pounds of buoyancy; one size fits all; manual inflation of the flotation; a system that allows donning and doffing of the flotation, emergency air source (air bottle) and survival item pouch together as a unit.

Criteria for proposals received in response to this solicitation will be available in Section L of the forthcoming Request For Proposal (RFP). Evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be available in Section M of the forthcoming RFP. Offerors will be required to submit 5 production representative units with their proposal.  NAVAIR intends to conduct the evaluation of proposals utilizing the written proposals as well as the sample units. The Government will conduct testing on the 5 sample units.  Testing to be conducted will be listed in Section C of the RFP, which will be released by mid- late November 2006.  After evaluations have been conducted, the Navy intends to down-select to one (1) responsible offeror who has best demonstrated the capability to produce the HESP in accordance with the performance specification and the stated evaluation criteria. A Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity of 30 systems will be purchased and for a fleet assessment to evaluate use of the system in an aircraft fully loaded with troop passengers.  Upon successful completion of the fleet assessment the full rate production contract shall be awarded.  It is anticipated that the initial contact award shall take place in or around March 2007.

NAVAIR intends to use Non-Government personnel in the source selection for this effort. Non-Government personnel will have the need to access proposals in order to support evaluation and selection for the Government. Therefore, before an award, it may be necessary for the solicited company to enter into non-disclosure agreements with these individual companies. A prerequisite for receiving a contract award will be registration in DOD's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by this agency. Questions with regards to this forthcoming solicitation shall be addressed by electronic mail only to Stella Obayuwana at stella.obayuwana@.navy.mil; no phone calls or faxes please.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) on behalf of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Office Interagency Medical Services (OIMS) has a requirement to procure an integrated health care system to augment the services provided through State and local detention facilities.  


The Office of Interagency Medical Services (OIMS) works to assure that the health care provided to the USMS prisoners housed within 95 USMS District Offices and approximately 200 District Sub-offices is consistent with established Prisoner Health Care Standards (PHCS) guidelines described in USMS Publication Number 100 (http://www.usmarshals.gov/prisoner/standards.htm). OIMS supports the USMS mission by arranging the most clinically appropriate and cost effective health care services with goals focusing on cost, quality, and accessibility to health care services provided outside of the detention facility.  On average, the USMS spends approximately $52 million per year for medical services delivered to prisoners by community medical care providers outside the walls of detention facilities, of which $22.5 million is subject to re-pricing of medical claims.  Additionally, the USMS spends approximately $9 million a year on prescriptions drugs.


The OFDT intends to award a fixed-price type contract.  The contract will have a potential term of 10 years consisting of one four-year base period and two three-year option periods.     Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work.    
The OFDT anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about November 14, 2006 with an estimated response date of January 8, 2007.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the OFDT.  

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for December 5, 2006 from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm Eastern Standard Time.  The address is:  1750 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, 22202

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to modify contract PBGC01-CT-05-0746 with Deloitte Consulting LLP, 12010 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, VA  20190 on a sole source basis.  This modification will increase the level of effort to provide additional support in areas such as:  enhancements to PBGC's Consolidated Financial Systems (CFS) application, integration/interfacing with other PBGC systems, system integration and regression testing, and impact assessments.  Deloitte Consulting LLP was responsible for the development and implementation of the CFS and is currently under contract to perform the operations and maintenance.  The contract for the development and implementation of the Premium Practitioner System (PPS) was awarded to SRA International on September 29, 2006 and when implemented will be a sub-ledger to the CFS.  Therefore the unique qualifications and experience of the Deloitte Consulting LLP staff under the CFS project are critical to the successful implementation of PPS.  The modification will allow for, among other items, the additional support from Deloitte Consulting LLP required by the PPS project.  Since Deloitte Consulting LLP is currently under contract to support the CFS, PBGC believes it is in the government's best interest to increase the level of effort under the contract to insure continuity and timeliness of the work required.  This is a notice of intent to modify the existing contract in accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1)(ii) and not a request for proposal.  See Note #22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOUCE PROCUREMENT DESC:  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Governments intent to award a sole source to Biacore, Inc. for purchase of a Biacore T100 Processing Unit.  Failure to purchase this pa rticular item would result in time-consuming exploration and validation of new standard protocols, as well as additional training for personnel.  Experimental designs routinely performed using Biacores patented chip surfaces may not translate to alternati ve technologies, making reproduction of existing results impossible.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored .  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is  received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the  following email address no later than 1:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time 27 November 2006.  Email:  jeff.ingram@amedd.army.mil  Please see Characteristics of this item below. unique characteristics of this instrument: 	 Sensitive SPR optical detection capable of making reliable direct, real-time, label free measurements on as little as a few picograms of bound material, and detecting direct measurements of molecules as small as 150 Daltons. 	Patented multichannel (up to 4 flow-cells) micro-fluidics integrated with an automated sample delivery system.  	Patented, reusable sensor chip surfaces available in a variety of surface chemistries. 	Assay temperature range of 4 to 45C for thermodynamic analysis. 	Integrated buffer degasser for robust assay data quality at elevated temperatures, and for longer unattended runs. 	Buffer switching capacity for use of multiple buffers within a single run. 	Evaluation software capable of global and statistical analysis of data for the following applications: specificity, kinetic, steady-state, thermodynamics and concentration. 	Surface plasmon resonance is the only technology that provides information about binding specificity, active concentration, kinetic rate constants, affinity and thermodynamics in a single instrument platform. Molecular interactions are monitored in real time at concentrations ranging from picomolar to millimolar.  Typical working ranges for association constant (Ka): 103107 M-1 S-1, dissociation rate constant (Kd): 5x10-60.5 S-1, affinity: 1042x1010 M-1, concentration range: 10-310-11 M.  It has the a bility to detect an extremely wide range of molecular masses  ranging from ca. 150 Da to the size of bacteriophage particles or whole cells;  	It is the only technology offering a full range of sensor surfaces, including dextran, which means a wider range of molecules can be characterized, starting from small molecules.  Many of these sensor surfaces are based on patented dextran surface chemis try proven to mimic a solution environment--including short dextran, flat carboxyl, low charge dextran. The sensor chip surfaces available support many established and proven covalent immobilization chemistries and capture systems. Available hydrophobic an d lipophilic sensor chips provide methods for working with lipids. Streptavidin sensor chips capture biotinylated molecules such as oligonucleotides, RNA and DNA, and NTA sensor chips support work with histidine tagged proteins; 	It is the only biosensor whose chip surface is reusable for multiple (often hundreds) of sample cycles by automatic injection of a regeneration solution between sample injections; 	Only the Biacore T100 incorporates a single sensor surface overlaid by four flow cells, each with a volume of 50nL. One flow cell can be used as a true reference during a sample injection. Typical injection volumes of 50  250L saves on reagent consumption. During the injection the proprie tary microfluidics system, automatically delivers sample to the chip surface at precisely controlled time and equal concentration across all the flow cells specified in the method;

<DESC>SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) has contractual support requirements for the Department of Defense (DoD) Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office (CNTPO).  The contractor(s) will be expected to simultaneously provide servi ces, critical equipment and material in various locations throughout the world.  These support services will provide: Technology Development and Application; Training, Operations, and Logistics Support; and Professional and Executive Support.  The contract or(s) must be capable of performing across all areas of the requirement. The areas of support services (Technology Development and Application; Training, Operations, and Logistics Support; and Professional and Executive Support) are further subdivided into more specific areas.  Technology Development and Application Support pri marily involves ISR counter-drug and counter-narcoterrorism technology.  However, other technology such as gamma and x-ray systems, drug sniffing devices or other technology to support the CNTPO mission may be required.  Technology Development and Applicat ion Support is subdivided into the following areas:  Research and Development; Technology Insertion, Systems Integration and Systems Engineering; Installation; Hardware and Software Fabrication; Test and Evaluation; Certification; and Technical Data Manage ment.  The ability to develop and implement technology quickly is essential to combat an ever-changing and mobile terrorist and narcoterrorist threat. Training, Operations and Logistics Support is subdivided into the following sub-areas:  Operation, Maintenance and Repair; Studies and Analyses (other than R&D); Incidental Construction; Painting, Coating, Sealing and Preservation; Publications; Logistics Support Analyses; Logistics Support and Equipment; Preservation, Packing and Marking; Training; Conveyance Purchase, Refurbishment, Leasing, Operation, and Support (Aircraft, Vehicles, and Vessels); Security Services; and Weapons.  Examples of Training, Op erations and Logistics Support include, but are not limited to, the following:  security force training for border police in Afghanistan; air crew training for Columbia; leasing armored vehicles for security forces training in Afghanistan; and building a f iring range for training in Afghanistan.  All of these sub-areas support the logistics and implementation of the CNTPO program and operations. Professional and Executive Support is subdivided into the following sub-areas:  Professional, Management, Administrative and Program Support; Information Operations and Public Affairs; Information Technology and Communications Network Development and Deplo yment; and Material and Equipment Purchase.  Examples of Professional and Executive Support include, but are not limited to, the following:  administrative support for COCOMs; strategic public relations support to senior government officials in Afghanistan  and Columbia; geographic information system support in Columbia; and the purchase of boots for counter narcoterrorist police in Afghanistan.   The estimated program value of the DoD Counter Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office (CNTPO) Program and Operations Support Acquisition is $100M  300M per year.   The Government estimates the resulting contracts place of performance to be 93% outside the continental United States (OCONUS).   The Government estimates the areas of support services to be divided according to the following percentages: 17% Technology Development and Application; 80% Training, Operations, and Logistics Support; and 3% Professional and Executive Support. Due to the highly adaptive nature of the enemy and the need to take advantage of short windows of opportunity, equipment and services are frequently required on short notice.  Contractor(s) will be expected to provide support within short time constraints in various locations throughout the world. The NAICS code for this effort  is 541710/1000 employees.   This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at the prime contractor level.  The Government anticipates awarding up to five (5) contracts using the procedures described below to satisfy this requirement. Specifically, the evaluation and selection of awards will be accomplished in two phases.  In the first phase, each proposal will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria announced in the solicitation (and as stated in the source selection plan) using b est value full and open competition procedures.  Up to four (4) of the most highly rated offerors placed in the competitive range without regard to business size will be selected for award.  In the second phase, the Government will determine if a small bus iness concerns proposal was selected for an award in the first phase.  If one or no small business concern proposal was selected for an award in the first phase, then the Government will review the small business concern proposals that remain in the compe titive range and award one (1) contract reserved for a small business concern (based on best value).  If two or more small business concern proposals were selected for award in the first phase, then the Government will review all offerors (both large busin esses and small business concerns) that remain in the competitive range and select one (1) for award (based on best value).  If no other small business concern proposals remain in the competitive range after phase one then the Government reserves the right  to make an additional award to a large business offeror remaining in the competitive range. Unless an exception to the IDIQ task order fair opportunity process applies, all awardees regardless of business size will be eligible for (and given the opportunity to compete for) task order requirements.  Specific performance requirements will be set fo rth in the task orders issued under the contract(s).   The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements (created by the affiliation of small businesses to form a prime contractor) or subcontract arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contr actor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  Further, subject to responsible contracting officer approval, the Government does not intend to impose any undue restrictions on tea m membership after award.  However, only one (1) proposal per prime contractor is authorized.  The expected release date of the final RFP is on or about 30 November 2006 with proposals due on 8 January 2007.  Schedules will be posted and updated on the USA SMDC website site identified below.  Additional information, as well as the RFP and any draft material when released will be available at the SMDC Website, HYPERLINK http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/Contracts.html.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PRO VIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.  Questions or correspondence should be directed to Joe Cloft, Contract Specialist, via email (joseph.cloft@smdc.army.mil) or via fax ( 256) 955-4240 and reference the RFP number W9113M-06-R-0014.

This contract will bridge a gap in contract support due to the fact that the current contract (NAT-0000-04-P00235/DTFANE-05-C-00007) expires November 30, 2006.  The current contract was originally expected to run for a longer period of performance; however, due to circumstances beyond the control of the program office, the support will be ending November 30, 2006.  Therefore, a single source contract for a  seven-month period of performance with an option for up to an additional three (3) months to allow for a possible transition to a new contractor is planned. The estimated total value of this acquisition is $3.3M. A follow-on competitive procurement (per the market survey notice of April 19, 2006) is planned for award by July 1,2007 with the possible transition period ending by September 30, 2007. It has been determined that it is in the best interests of the FAA to acquire these services from Metron Aviation for the following reasons: A contract vehicle that provides the specified services with the necessary level of contractor expertise is essential to the success of CATMT.   Benefits of CATMT research have led to procedural changes and tool development to proactively manage changes in Air Traffic Control (ATC) system constraints that has resulted in significant delay avoidance and cost reduction to airlines, and therefore to the traveling public.  Metron Aviation, Inc. is currently the sole provider of this support.   Failure to award this bridge contract by the expiration of the current contract will lead to an interruption in contract support.  This in turn will lead to an interruption in current CATMT activities meaning that the FAA ATO Systems Operations Programs Directorate will not be able to meet commitments that ultimately impact FAA Flight Plan Goals of System Safety and Capacity. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If you have any questions about or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer Mr. Tim Eckert no later than close of business Thursday, November 16 at the number specified above.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions: Q1:  There is only one mat at the top of the slab, approximately 1" down (minimum) from the top of concrete, correct?  There are typically two mats in a slab.  This slab has only one? A1:  Yes, there is only one mat. Q2:  The completion date is shown as Jan '06.  I assume this is supposed to be Jan '07. A2:  Yes, it should be 2007. (See below for change.) Q3:  For the project to be awarded in December, my gut feeling is that there is no way this project will be completed in January.  Please confirm the dates and time to complete is correct. A3:  See below for change.  Q4:  The slab is to be level with the top of the surrounding grade.  Will the conctractor be required to do the excavation, or will the government do the excavation (and backfill)? A4:  The location of the target is a dry lake bed; therefore, some minor leveling and dirt work may have to be performed by the contractor. Q5:  More specifically, what is the condition of the road, to the site, and what is the estimated distance from the site to the concrete batch plant(s)? A5:  The road to the build site is black top to within a mile with about a 1/4 mile being dirt road.  The actual build site is a dry lake bed.  The concrete batch plant is about 5 miles from the main gate in Ridgecrest, CA. IMPORTANT:  Due to some information that was just brought to our attention, the new award date will be 16 November 2006 and the new completion date will be 8 December 2006. The Contract office will be closed Friday, 11/10, through Sunday, 11/12.  The closing date for proposals will not be extended.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions: Q1:  Please clarify Q/A # 4 (Mod 3) - The RFQ states that the Target is (Two feet; Height above ground: 0) That places the bottom of the concrete target at ground level. Ground 0 being top of existing dirt. With the target sitting above ground. Miner grading to be leveling of casting pad on natural grade. A1:  The bottom of the concrete is on the existing ground level.  All 2ft of the slab is above ground. Q2:  Dec. 8 completion? Does this mean pour and strip forms complete by Dec. 8 with curing continuing after Dec. 8? A2:  Slab must be poured by 8 December 2006.  The forms can be stripped after that date. Q3:  Curing? Spray with curing compound? No water curing required. A3:  Water curing cannot be used.  If a curing compound will help, then it can be used. Q4:  Is there a federal wage determination that will apply to this project? A4:  This item is considered a deliverable product or supply.  It is not a service.  Q5:  Is the surface of target to be level with the lake bed?  Do we need to excavate 2 ft deep and compact the bottom?  Any compaction requirements?  A5:  Again, the bottom of the concrete is on the existing ground level.  All 2ft of slab is above ground.  No compaction is required. Q6:  Is there any surface finishing requirement?  How level and smooth does the concrete need to be?  A6:  It does not have to be as smooth or as level as a standard driveway but close.  A rough trowel finish is fine. Q7:  It sounds like this target is in a dry lake bed.  How solid is the surface?  Can we drive concrete trucks on it without doing any additional grading or compaction?  A7:  Yes, the build site is on the lake bed, and concrete trucks have no problem.  No compaction required. Q8:  How far out onto the lake bed is the location?  A8:  1/2 mile. Q9:  Is there 1 mat of rebar or 2?  Q9:  One mat. Q10:  Who is responsible for performing the testing?  Are we responsible for any costs related to testing?  A10:  The customer will handle the testing of the samples.  The contractor is not responsible for any costs related to testing. Q11:  Can we pour against the sides of the excavation or do we need to form the sides?  A11:  It will have to be formed; no part of the slab is buried. IMPORTANT:  Due to some information that was just brought to our attention, the new award date will be 16 November 2006 and the new completion date will be 8 December 2006. The Contract office will be closed Friday, 11/10, through Sunday,11/12.  The closing date for proposals will not be extended.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:  Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL)

A.  INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) development program.  Based on research the Government has funded and/or reviewed, it is believed that the requirements of this BAA procurement can best be met with a cryogenically cooled, Ytterbium-doped YAG (Yb:YAG) laser that operates at ~1.03 microns.  However, the Government is also willing to consider other DPSSL approaches that have a lasing wavelength of ~1.03 microns.  The program will be conducted as a joint effort involving MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) and industry.  MIT/LL will have primary responsibility for risk reduction and laboratory breadboard research and development.  Industry will be responsible for working with MIT/LL on defining the risk reduction research efforts, transferring technology from MIT/LL, and developing a brassboard laser design.  The MIT/LL and industry efforts will be funded separately by the Government.  The industry program will consist of four phases: Phase 1 will cover technology transfer from MIT/LL to industry, a system performance trade assessment of the BAA technical requirements, preliminary laser system modeling and simulation (based on information/data provided by MIT/LL to industry), and a brassboard concept design review (CoDR).  The Phase 1 system performance trade assessment will allow the contractor to perform a detailed evaluation of their proposed design, covering system performance and packaging parameters such as laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.  The primary purpose of the system performance trade assessment is to arrive at a design for airborne applications that optimally balances laser technical performance with system packaging, maintainability and reliability constraints.  As part of the trade assessment, the contractor will also generate an error budget tree for identifying and monitoring key technical performance and packaging issues during all phases of the technical effort.  Phase 2 (Option A) will provide technology transfer from MIT/LL to industry, laser system modeling and simulation, a brassboard preliminary design review (PDR), and a preliminary cost estimate proposal for building a TRL 6 brassboard during Phase 4 (Option C).  Phase 3 (Option B) will provide technology transfer from MIT/LL to industry, laser system modeling and simulation, a critical design review (CDR), and a final cost proposal for building a TRL 6 brassboard during Phase 4 (Option C).  If this last contract option is exercised, the Government will only select one industry partner to fabricate the TRL 6 brassboard laser system.  The brassboard design effort in Phases 1 through 3 is for a ruggedized, flight-qualifiable laser brassboard (TRL 6) that meets all technical performance and packaging requirements listed herein.  Deliverables will be those called out in BAA AL-2007-01.  As noted above, delivery of a ruggedized brassboard laser is an optional part of this program solicitation for which funding has not been identified.  The total program budget for the industry technical effort is approximately ~$1M for Phase 1, ~$2M for Phase 2, and ~$10M to ~$12M for Phase 3 (up to ~$15M total funding over ~2.5 years).  Depending on funds availability and quality of the BAA technical proposals, one or two contractors may be funded for the first phase, which should be for approximately 6 months at ~$500K per effort.  If appropriate, one or two contractors may be funded for the second phase (~12 months).  If appropriate, one or two contractors may be funded for the third phase (~24 months).  The projected start date is at the beginning of the third quarter GFY07.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Stephen G. Post, MDA/AL, 505-853-3811, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Ms. Susan McDaniel, MDA/ALK, at 505-853-1005.  In addition, the DoD proposal evaluation team may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the proposal evaluation process.

B.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
During the first three phases of this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser development program, all industry modeling and simulation shall be validated by risk reduction experiments and testing of the laboratory breadboard at MIT/LL.  Any contractor funded for the fourth phase of this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser development program will use modeling and simulation to support design, development and delivery of a 6 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser to the DoD.  Emphasis will be placed on solid-state laser architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability (for airborne platforms), and ruggedness.  The contractor(s) is(are) expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution.

ATILL technical performance goals:

1)  Wavelength: The laser wavelength shall be at ~1.03 microns.
2)  Radiance (W/cm^2-sr): The Radiance (Brightness) of the laser output beam shall be greater than or equal to a laser of 6 kW average power with a Beam Quality (BQ) better than or equal to 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) as directly measured by a far-field power-in-the-bucket (PITB) technique, where the bucket extent is nominally defined by the energy/power contained in the laser?s far-field central lobe.  The laser shall have a minimum average output power of 6.0 kW over the entire run-time duration specified in paragraph (a) below.
3)  Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): The laser's PRF shall nominally be 5.0 kHz, variable plus or minus 15 percent with a controlled PRF slew rate of up to 1500 Hertz per second.
4)  Pulse Length: The laser's full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) temporal pulse length shall be less than or equal to 15 ns, with a goal of less than or equal to 5 ns.  As part of the laser system trade study during the first contract phase, the effect of pulse length on laser system performance and reliability will be investigated.
5)  Coherence Length: The laser output temporal coherence length shall be less than or equal to 5 centimeters (goal of 2 centimeters).
6)  Polarization: The laser output polarization shall be linear with a contrast ratio of greater than 100 to 1.
7)  Beam Jitter: The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 10% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the FWHM power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table (i.e., the table will not induce jitter in the laser head).
8)  Pulse-to-Pulse Energy Stability: The pulse-to-pulse energy variation shall not exceed plus/minus 2 percent.

ATILL packaging goals:

a)  Run Time: The laser brassboard shall be designed to operate continuously for at least 300 seconds (goal of 600 s).  All performance measurements on the Phase 1 sub-scale and Phase 2 full-scale laboratory devices (power, beam quality, efficiency, beam jitter, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 s.  Additionally, the device shall be capable of reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., ten or more twenty-second bursts with five-second periods of non-lasing between bursts, then return to stand-by).  In this mode of operation, the requisite run time only includes the sum of the 'laser on' periods.  The laser power supply and cooling system recycle times are mission and platform dependent; recycle time impact on system weight, volume, efficiency, etc., will be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 system performance trade assessments.
b)  Hold Time:  The laser brassboard shall be designed to store sufficient cryogen such that the laser will be able to run at full output power for at least 300 seconds even if the cryostat was filled with cryogen more than 40 hours prior to any laser operation.  This hold time requirement should be met for any environmental conditions discussed herein.
c)  Start-Up Time: The laser start-up time, defined as the time required to transition from a stand-by condition (defined during the Phase 1 system performance trade study) to a condition where all output requirements are met, shall be no more than 1 second.
d)  Wallplug Efficiency: The laser wallplug efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 10% (goal of 12%), where wallplug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used to operate the laser.  The contractor is required to design a 6 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
e)  Output Power-To-Mass Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration efforts, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their laser brassboard design will meet an output power-to-mass ratio requirement of 10 W/kg (goal of 12 W/kg) for a nominal 6 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total system mass of less than 600 kg (goal of 500 kg).  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers (no externally available thermal reservoir should be assumed), power supplies, controller, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchanger manifolds, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with an optical mounting assembly, cover, and other necessary fixtures.  The contractor is required to design a 6 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
f)  Output Power-To-Volume Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration phases, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their deliverable brassboard laser will meet an output power-to-volume ratio of 10 W/liter (goal of 20 W/liter) for a nominal 6 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total volume of less than or equal to 0.6 cubic meters (goal of less than or equal to 0.3 cubic meters).  See item (d) for a definition of what constitutes the laser system.  The contractor is required to design a 6 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
g)  Temperature Range: The ambient operating temperature range of the laser brassboard design for ground-based and airborne applications shall be 15 to 35 degrees C, and its storage temperature range shall be ?54 to 50 degrees C.  Herein, 'storage' is defined as the periods between tests or missions (e.g., an aircraft in an unheated aircraft hanger).
h)  Humidity: For ground-based operations, up to 95% humidity from 2 to 35 degrees C; for airborne applications, up to 85% humidity from 15 to 35 degrees C.
i)  Operating/Storage Pressure: Minus 1,000 ft to plus 10,000 ft.
j)  Platform operating angles, acceleration, vibration, shock, and other operating/storage parameters will be provided early in Phase 1 during the system performance trade assessment effort.  As a minimum, offerors should provide a laser system design that is compatible with an airborne environment similar to a 747-type aircraft.

For item (2), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser's Radiance (Brightness), output power and beam quality and what the possible technical issues are in making such measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide in their proposal a discussion of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared).  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made for items (3) through (8) and (a) through (j).  Again, it is noted here that, though a laser system brassboard design shall be developed through PDR level during Phase 2 and CDR level during Phase 3, there is no laser system brassboard deliverable for the future BAA.

As noted previously, the program shall be carried out in three phases, with a forth phase carried as an unpriced option on the initial contract.  Each phase shall be priced separately, with Phase 1 offered as the basic contract and Phases 2 and 3 offered as contract options.  It is also noted here that hardware procured and used in Phase 1 may be also used in the Phases 2 and 3 contract options (if exercised).

As part of the brassboard laser system design effort, the contractor will ensure through appropriate evaluation/assessment techniques that the laser beam's output characteristics do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at a Government facility or on a specified platform.  This effort will be included in the Phase 1 system performance trade assessment, which as mentioned previously will also cover laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.

For the intended BAA solicitation, flight qualifiable means that the laser brassboard is designed to undergo flight qualification testing with minimal system hardware/software changes required.  This approximately corresponds to a Technology Readiness Level 6.

The proposal expectations (NOT for the RFI) are as follows: Offerors shall limit the length of their Technical Proposals to 75 pages or less (12 point font), including all pages (no exceptions).  Additional information on required fonts, page formatting, etc., may be found in the BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions (to be added when the BAA is published).  Cost proposals will be limited in length to 50 pages or less, including all cost sheets, basis of estimates and other supporting information.  Cost proposal preparation instructions will be included in the RFP package when the BAA is issued.  As part of the Technical Proposal, offerors must clearly demonstrate through past performance and corporate/institutional capabilities that they possess the resources and technical capabilities necessary to perform successfully on the BAA.  This should include identified experience designing, developing, fabricating, and testing ruggedized (TRL ~6), fieldable, high Radiance, high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser systems.  The Government encourages any interested, qualified not-for-profit laboratories/institutions (e.g., FFRDCs) or Universities that are based in the United States to team, or form suitable partnering relationships in conformance with their by laws and applicable statutes and regulations, with qualified industrial partners on this solicitation.  The intent of the intended BAA is to develop, in the first three contract phases, the technology and industrial base necessary to build a ruggedized, ~1.03 micron wavelength, high average power, diode-pumped solid-state laser system (TRL 6) that may be procured as part of contract Phase 4 (Option C).  As part of the response to the BAA, the offeror should provide a Phase 4 brassboard ROM cost and schedule.

Following are questions supporting the ATILL RFI and comments on any recommended clarifications involving the aforementioned RFI:

1)  Are the proposed ATILL technical requirements achievable with currently available technology?  Are there any technical requirements that are considered to be especially difficult to achieve with currently available technology?

2)  Are the proposed schedule and funding appropriate for the proposed ATILL technology development program?

3)  What text changes and/or clarifications, if any, are recommended for the proposed ATILL BAA?

4)  A brief explanation of company/organization/institution resources and technical capabilities available/necessary to perform successfully on the proposed BAA.

5)  Are you a company that has the capability to provide the requested hardware and are also eligible for a certain type of set-aside? If so, please note briefly your capabilities and the type of set-aside. Discussing the matter with the techical POC would also be beneficial to ensure you are fully capable prior to the Government establishing a set-aside.

Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are due no later than Close of Business on *** 08 December 2006 ***.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. is conducting a market survey to identify sources that are capable of molding composite materials for an  improved increment protector (IIP) design for 120mm mortar ammunition.   Materials need to have the ability to be molded by common processes, preferably  injection molding.  The improved increment protector design will be similar in  design to the existing propelling charge support (see attached drawings).   Protectors will meet performance requirements of drop testing (3 ft and 7 ft)  and vibration (secured and loose cargo) testing at -60F, ambient, and +160F  temperature extremes without causing damage to the propelling charges packed  within.  The protector design must be made from material that will retain its  dimensions (no warpage) during fabrication and use of the parts.  Foam lining  on the interior of the protector will be required to ensure a tight fit for the  propelling charges.  Offerors may be required to fabricate a prototype mold of  the protector design and produce 50 sets of protectors for engineering  testing.  Upon successful completion of the engineering tests, the offeror will  fabricate a production mold of the final protector design and produce 200 sets  of protectors for product verification testing.  It is requested that the  offeror provide a rough cost estimate for the effort and unit production cost  for the protector design.  Offerors shall also provide a summary of their  company's capabilities including: organizations, name/address/point of contact  identification, a description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing process,  inspection capability, personnel, past experience, proven monthly production  capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements, and whether the company is  a small or large business.  The market survey is for planning purposes only and  shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the  part of the Government.  The Government will utilize the information provided  for planning purposes only.  All information submitted will be provided at no  cost to the Government and will be held in a confidential status.  The  contractor shall provide all information requested in this notification by no  later than November 24, 2006 by electronic mail to  michael.samra@pica.army.mil . Reference note 26.

<SUBJECT>A -- Synthetic Enzymes for Selective Hydrolysis of Soluble Cellulose Oligomers or Other Soluble Polysaccharides
<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory has conceived a method to create synthetic enzymes that would catalyze the release of soluble monosaccharides or disaccharides from soluble linear plant polysaccharide oligomers. The synthetic enzymes could be physically separated from the solution / mixture without the use of expensive membrane or chromatographic processes.  This method, once developed, would allow potentially lower-temperature processing, with complete recovery and reuse of the enzyme, eliminating the limits of enzyme cost on renewable biomass utilization for production of fuels and chemicals.  This technology could apply to the production of fuels (e.g. ethanol) and chemicals (e.g. lactate, succinate, etc.) from lignocellulosic biomass. This principle could also be extended to starch polymers to replace amylases, to pectins to replace pectinases, or any polymer for which there exists a hydrolytic enzyme.
 
The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms that would like to participate in development and commercialization of this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Development of the technology would be through Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with most or all of the funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the technology and its development and licensing.  Interested parties should respond on or before December 20, 2006.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact John Snyder:

<SUBJECT>W--Lease of C-130J Aircraft for Airshow/Demonstration and Test Purposes
<DESC>The 657th Aeronautical Systems Squadron (657 AESS), Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is  contemplating the short-term lease (lease) of United States Air Force  (USAF) active-duty C-130J aircraft (Aircraft) under Lease Agreement  FA8625-07-L-6476 (the Agreement), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2667 and Air  Force Instruction (AFI) 64-103. Purposes for the lease of Aircraft under the Agreement include: (1) air  show participation; (2) orientation, demonstration, and evaluation  flights; and (3) investigation and/or testing of new functionality and  capabilities for the C-130J weapon system. The term of the Agreement  between the USAF (Lessor) and the contractor (Lessee) shall not exceed  five (5) years, with the lease of any individual Aircraft under the  Agreement not to exceed six (6) months. Only USAF active-duty C-130J  Aircraft may be available for lease under the Agreement; United States Air  Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and other Department of Defense (DoD)  component C-130J aircraft shall not be available for lease under the  Agreement. Any lease of Aircraft under the Agreement shall only take place  on a non-interference basis with US Government requirements. A fixed daily rental charge and variable charges based on flight time  shall be paid by the Lessee to the Lessor for all flights performed for  the purposes listed above. These fees shall include charges for  depreciation and interest of leased Aircraft, as well as costs associated  with the upkeep of the airframe, engines, and major aircraft systems of  leased Aircraft. Pursuant to DoD Directive 7230.8, no fixed daily or  variable rental charge applies to a lease for: (1) air shows or trade  exhibitions held outside the United States; or (2) for sales  demonstrations to representatives of foreign governments. Under these  circumstances, lease charges are limited to incremental costs incurred by  the US Government in support of the lease that would not have been  incurred had the Aircraft not been leased. During the term of the  Agreement, the Lessee shall be responsible for all direct costs relating  to leased Aircraft, including consumable supplies, aviation fuel, and  Lessee labor costs associated with support and maintenance of leased  Aircraft. The Lessee shall assume liability for charges that may be  lawfully imposed on the Lessee by agencies of the US Government, or  foreign governments and their taxing authorities, for certification and  registration of leased Aircraft and payment of any applicable and lawful  taxes or other charges. The Lessee shall be responsible for maintaining leased Aircraft in a safe  and serviceable condition in accordance with approved procedures that meet  or exceed current USAF-approved Technical Orders. The Lessee shall also  affirm that it has implemented, and has in place, proper procedures and  facilities to ensure the safe and proper operation and storage of leased  Aircraft. The Lessee shall maintain adequate property control records, and  shall maintain leased Aircraft records in accordance with the Air Force  Technical Order 781 Series. The Lessee shall be solely and fully liable for any damage to, or loss or  destruction of, leased Aircraft resulting from any cause whatsoever during  the Lessee's possession of leased Aircraft. The Lessee shall agree to  release the US Government from any and all damages (including  consequential damages). The Lessee shall also defend, indemnify, and hold  the US Government, its agents, officers, and employees, harmless from any  and all loss and liability, whether in tort or in contract, that might  arise in connection with the lease of an Aircraft (1) because of injury or  death of personnel of the Lessor, the Lessee, or third parties; and (2)  damage to, or destruction of, property of the Lessee or third parties, and  leased property, support equipment, or other property of the US  Government. The Lessee shall possess and maintain adequate insurance to  cover all such liabilities, and proof of adequate insurance (or proof of  the Lessee's ability to insure against loss) shall be provided to the  Lessor. Accident investigations shall be performed in accordance with AFI 91-204  procedures, with investigative authority to remain with the USAF. The  Lessee shall conform to applicable health and safety standards and safety  rules, and shall take any additional precautions as the Government may  require for safety and accident prevention purposes. The Lessee shall secure from the Department of State, or other responsible  US Government agency, any export licenses or other approvals required  under the Arms Export Control Act or other US laws or regulations prior to  any use of leased Aircraft in connection with the provision of articles or  services to a foreign Lessor or other foreign persons. The Lessee agrees that its logs, reports and records relating to leased  Aircraft shall at all reasonable times be subject to inspection and review  by any authorized representative of the USAF, and shall make such reports  to the Lessor regarding leased Aircraft as may be required by the  Government. Usage forecasts and test plans shall be submitted to the USAF for approval  prior to any use of leased Aircraft. All air show appearances shall be  approved through appropriate USAF channels, and shall be subject to air  show participation procedures stated in AFI 64-103. Any transfer,  encumbrance, or other use of leased Aircraft by the Lessee shall be  prohibited without prior USAF approval. Any public release of information  regarding the use of leased Aircraft shall be forwarded to and/or approved  by the USAF, including news releases, photographs and photographic  material, advertising, films, and pamphlets. Any use of leased Aircraft under the Agreement shall be from the premises  of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company,  Marietta, Georgia, or from another location as mutually agreed to between  the Lessor and the Lessee.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The NetApp FAS3020HA and NetApp FAS270HA hardware has undergone tests, assessment, and evaluation and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is SB1341-07-RQ-0011.  The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This acquisition is being conducted pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5.
 
The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  This solicitation is being conducted on a competitive small business set-aside basis.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541910, and the small business size standard for that NAICS code is $6.5 million.  The list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure are as follows: 

Item No. 0001, Contractor Completion of Requirements Detailed in Performance Work Statement (PWS) Below; Quantity: 1; Unit: Job. 

Item No. 0002, Contractor Travel associated with Item No. 0001; Unit: Lot (Not-to-Exceed $7,000, and to be reimbursed in accordance with FAR 31.205-46, plus G&A burden, if applicable). 

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS):

BACKGROUND

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award was established by Congress in 1987 to improve the competitiveness of U.S. organizations.  The Award recognizes U.S. organizations for their performance improvements and raises awareness about the importance of organizational performance excellence as a competitive edge. 

Over the nearly 20 years since the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award was established, the field of organizational performance management has evolved from a narrow focus on product and service quality to an enterprise-level focus on overall organizational  performance.  In addition, the leaders of U.S. organizations, particularly the CEO?s of large companies, have shifted their focus away from quality and toward what they view as more strategic matters, such as globalization and strategy execution.  In essence, they view quality as an operational issue, not worthy of executive attention. 

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Criteria (the Criteria for Performance Excellence) have evolved to stay on the leading edge of validated U.S. management practice, and the Criteria address the current issues facing the leaders of U.S. organizations.  However, the name of the Award has not been kept current with these changes.  It no longer reflects the modern view of performance management or captures the hearts and minds of the leaders of U.S organizations, particularly large manufacturing and service organizations.

Accordingly, there is a need to rename the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award to make it current with changes to the Baldrige Criteria and U.S. management practice.  To this end, the Baldrige National Quality Program seeks to conduct a branding study of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award to identify a new name for it.  

1.  SCOPE OF WORK - The purpose of this requirement is to conduct a branding study to identify a recommended new name for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award as well as identify a ?tagline? that will be used in concert with the new name. 

To this end, the Contractor shall achieve the following objectives:

 - Conduct a broad-based survey of the Baldrige National Quality Program customer and stakeholder base to identify current perceptions of the value and equity of the Baldrige brand.   

 - Analyze and synthesize the data gathered from this survey and use it to identify potential new names and taglines for the program.

 - Develop multiple proposed new names and taglines for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.

 - Test the proposed new names and taglines with a broad-base of customers and stakeholders to ensure that the names have validity and relevancy in the marketplace.

 - Analyze and synthesize the data from these tests and develop a prioritized list of new names and taglines for the Award. 

The Contractor shall complete all of this work within 14 weeks of acceptance of the resultant purchase order.  Contractor travel expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with Chapter 301 of the Federal Travel Regulation, insofar as they do not exceed $7,000.  

2.  SPECIFIC TASKS - The Contractor shall:

 - Meet in-person or via conference call with the NIST Technical Point of Contact/Order Contact (P/OC) and their designees to review the scope, activities, timeline, and deliverables for the project.  This meeting shall take place within one week of the requirement being awarded. 

 - Conduct a broad-based customer survey of the Baldrige National Quality Program customer and stakeholder base to identify current perceptions of the value and equity of the Baldrige brand.  The customer and stakeholder base includes several thousand individuals from organizations throughout the United States.  The survey should be administered to as many as possible of these individuals.  The survey questions shall be developed by the Contractor and submitted to the NIST technical P/OC for their review and approval, and the final survey instrument and communications that accompany the instrument shall be approved by the NIST technical P/OC before the survey is administered.  The specific sample population shall also be approved by the NIST technical P/OC. 

 - Analyze and synthesize the data from the surveys and produce a report for use by the Baldrige National Quality Program.  The survey report shall contain the methods used in the survey, the key findings from the research-including a list of potential names and taglines based on the research, and other sections to be determined in concert with the Baldrige National Quality Program.  This report shall be provided to the NIST technical P/OC for their review.  The raw data from the survey shall also be provided to the NIST technical P/OC if requested.

 - Meet with the NIST P/OC and their designees to present and review the findings from the survey report and identify potential new names and taglines for the program.  The Contractor shall coordinate with the NIST P/OC to set the agenda for the meeting, and the Contractor shall facilitate the meeting.  The agenda for the meeting shall be approved by the NIST Technical P/OC in advance of the meeting. The outcome of the meeting shall be the identification of an agreed upon list of multiple proposed new names and taglines for the Award.  

 - Test the proposed new names and taglines with a broad-base of customers and stakeholders to ensure that the names and taglines have validity and relevancy in the marketplace.  The sample population for the test should include the customers and stakeholders who were previously surveyed or some subset of these groups.  The Contractor shall obtain written approval from the NIST Technical P/OC for the specific testing methodology and the sample population prior to commencing the testing. 

 - Analyze and synthesize the data from the name and tagline testing and produce a report for use by the Baldrige National Quality Program.  The survey report shall contain the methods used in the testing, the key findings from the research-including a prioritized list of proposed names and taglines for the program, and other sections to be determined in concert with the Baldrige National Quality Program.  The Contractor shall provide this report to the NIST Technical P/OC and their designees.  Upon request by the NIST Technical P/OC, the Contractor shall also provide the ?raw data? obtained by the Contractor from the testing.

 - Meet with the NIST Technical P/OC and their designees to present and review the findings from the testing report and validate the prioritized list of new names and taglines for the program.  The Contractor shall coordinate the agenda with the NIST Technical P/OC, and the Contractor shall facilitate the meeting.  The Contractor shall obtain written approval from the NIST Technical P/OC for the agenda in advance of the meeting.  As a result of the meeting, the Contractor shall identify and create a prioritized list of new names and taglines for the Baldrige National Quality Award.

<DESC>Questions & Answers from Site Visit.

*Do we need to submit a completed copy of 52.212-3 with our proposal?

Yes.

*The numbers in the PWS and the numbers on the exhibits do not coorespond.  Which numbers do we follow?

Follow the numbering in the PWS.  The only numbers in the exhibits you need to worry about are the ones attributed to parking lots.  The other numbers in the exhibits should be treated as a priority listing only.

*The snow removed from the Air Force Memorial, where do we dump it?

It will need to be dumped in the areas marked as XXX on the exhibits.

*The instructions to offerors states the submissions shall not exceed 15 pages.  Does this include MSDS sheets?  Resumes of key personnel?  Past Performance?  Price proposal information?

Yes - the 15 pages includes all portions. 

*Can you please given an example of other indirect work which may need to be performed by the on site supervisors?

The only indirect work would include only work associated with supervision.

*Section 4.4 of the PWS states MSDS sheets are due 10 days after award but the instructions to offerors states they are a part of the technical proposal.  Can you please clarify?

Per the Instruction to offerors it states the following:
 
?Describe the deicing compounds and abrasives proposed for use and submit all related Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and manufacturer?s information.?
 
Please do as it states, but submit the MSDS sheets 10 days after award as stated in the PWS.  We are mainly concerned with suggestions, prices, and manufacturer's information at time of proposal.

*If multiple applications of chemical are required, will the contractor be paid (under  CLIN) the ICE TREATMENT clin times the number of treatments?  For example, if it snows 20 inches at one time, and 3 chemical applications are required, will the snow clins be payable x 3?

Yes

*Are the ice treatments ordered by the government or is the contract performance based and it is under the determination of the contractor?

The partial treatments will be requested by the Government.  Otherwise it would require you to keep constant watch of all areas to determine if an application is necessary.  The main treatments are deemed necessary by the Contractor, but if a partial is needed, the COR will let you know.
