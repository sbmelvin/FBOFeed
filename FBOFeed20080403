10.	Description: 
The F101 Fuel Manifold Fill Valve is a sub component of the AugmentorFuel Control.  The circulation flow rate to keep manifolds filled is afunction of augmenter fuel control inlet pressure (PR) and MEC servopressure (PC).  The manifold fill valve spool turns off all circulationflow to fuel manifolds during non-augmentation and when engine is shutdown.  Flow is regulated at discharge pressure (PB1).  Duringnon-augmented operation, the manifold fill valve uses filtered flowprovided by the engine fuel boost pump to circulate fuel to the core,fan, and local manifolds.  This keeps manifolds filled to avoid delayand to provide smooth augmenter response.  The fuel from the manifoldsis returned to the manifold fill valve and is then routed back to theengine fuel boost pump (PIR).  Circulation flow enters augmenter fuelcontrol from the inlet and discharges through the normal dischargeports.  The return flow from manifolds join and return to the fuelcontrol through a single port.  Dimensions: Approximately 3 inchesdiameter X 6 inches long; composed of aluminum allow/steel; weighsapproximately 1.5 lbs.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 46.45pt">The HQ Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Contracting Division, Acquisition Management Branch (AFRC/A7KA) intends to award multiple contracts to provide command wide construction and engineering activities supporting the Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (S/R&amp;M) of real property.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Projects will be located at the various AFRC host bases: Dobbins ARB (Marietta), GA; Homestead ARB (Miami), FL; Westover ARB (Chicopee), MA; Minneapolis ARS, MN; Pittsburgh IAP-ARS, PA; Youngstown ARS, HO; Niagara Falls IAP-ARS, NY; Grissom ARB (Kokomo), IN; March ARB (Riverside), CA; Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX. This contract is referred to as Commandwide O &amp; M Project Execution Contract (COMPEC).<br /><br />The COMPEC contracts will support a range of S/R&amp;M efforts with both small (&lt;$100K) and large task orders (&gt;$5M) expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;The capabilities under this contract are intended to provide planning and construction support for the various AFRC host bases. The COMPEC acquisition strategy contemplated is awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with pricing arrangements consisting of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requirements will be satisfied via design/build, traditional construction delivery types as well as incidental maintenance activities. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 236220 with an applicable size standard of $31,000,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 46.45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -0.2in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This will be a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3 Source Selection.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 46.45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -0.2in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed contract is expected to be a one (1) year basic plus four (4) one year options Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Task orders will be issued against the contract as required. The RFP release date is scheduled for 18 Apr 08 and will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS. The proposal due date is scheduled for 19 May 08, however, Past Performance Information (PPI) Forms are due NLT 10 days prior to the proposal due date or 09 May 08.&nbsp; The Government anticipates making award(s) without discussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All inquiries or comments are to be provided in writing via e-mail to Monica.Meadows@afrc.af.mil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The Contractor will work with NCI
program staff and with NCI-sponsored clinical trial networks to develop the
Patient-Reported Outcomes version of symptom elements that are contained within

development of an electronic-based and psychometrically-robust patient-reported
outcome version of the symptomatic adverse events (AE) to complement the NCI
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br /> <br /> The resulting PRO-CTCAE will: 1) be comprehensive to capture a range of
symptoms and functioning that enhances monitoring of adverse events; 2) have
minimal burden on the patient in terms of survey length and comprehension; 3)
be adaptable for translation into multiple languages to accommodate the
diversity of patients who participate in NCI-sponsored clinical trials; 4)

complement the revised CTCAE (version 4.0); 6) meet the standards of
compatibility within the CaBIG specifications; and 7) have minimal
administrative burden for health care providers who will collect and interpret
data for reporting adverse events and for informing patient care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of integrating the system within NCI-sponsored trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br /> It is anticipated that a resulting contract will utilize a phasing approach.<br /> <br /> Phase I<br /> Identify Barriers and Ideal Conditions to Develop, Implement, and Validate the

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Arial;">1. This notice is the first of three Notices made pursuant to FAR 5.205(b) indicating The Department of Homeland Security's intent to sponsor a new Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).&nbsp; Specifically, DHS intends to sponsor a system engineering/systems development&nbsp;(SED) FFRDC to be known as the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (SEDI).&nbsp; The typical role of an SED FFRDC is to help DHS identify and implement technical systems engineering and acquisitions best practices in major acquisition programs that will ensure fair, efficient, effective, and open competition throughout the acquisition lifecycle. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. By The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296, as amended), Section 305, Congress authorized DHS to establish one or more FFRDCs to assist the DHS in formulating and addressing important homeland security issues, particularly those where scientific, technical and analytical expertise is involved, such as systems engineering/systems development. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. DHS will be the ultimate sponsor of this new SED FFRDC; however, the Science and Technology Directorate (DHS (S&amp;T)) should be viewed as its primary sponsor. In general, the DHS (S&amp;T) will provide technical quality, business, financial and contractual oversight. The SED FFRDC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the SED FFRDC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the SEDI for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS (S&amp;T). </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial;">4. The SEDI Contractor shall provide all required and necessary space, equipment, support and technical personnel (except that as may be Government furnished) to establish, set up and manage the SEDI. Performance of the SED FFRDC management function required under the Contract will take place in the Washington DC metropolitan areas, with the exception of assignees to field operations. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial;">5. The work to be performed under this contract will involve access to, handling of and generation of classified information up to and including Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;6. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of functions, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Q -- Advanced Therapeutics for Treating Neutropenia Resulting from Acute Exposure to Ionizing Radiation
<SOLNBR>HHS-BARDA-08-10
<CONTACT>Linda I Luczak, Phone 202-260-0271, Email linda.luczak@hhs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking to acquire medical countermeasures (MCM) that will support an effective public health emergency response to a radiological or nuclear event.  The United States Government (USG) contemplates a five year Firm Fixed Price single award contract for MCMs that can specifically treat the neutropenia component of Acute Radiation Syndrome.  Neutropenia is defined as the depression of neutrophils which occurs as a component of the hematologic pathologies arising following sufficient exposure to ionizing radiation (h-ARS).   It is the goal of the RFP to obtain advanced development products, i.e., at a development level, as classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are in no less than Phase 2 of the Investigational New Drug (IND) stage as well as those products which already have approved therapeutic indications.  Prior to the submission of the proposal, the offeror must have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in pathologies known to be associated with, or as components of, Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  It is the goal of BARDA to place in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Final Drug Product (FDP) which may be used for therapy of neutropenia in human subjects associated with whole body acute exposure to ionizing radiation exceeding 2 Gy.
The desired product that will be acquired with this contract must be able to support a public health emergency.  The current post-event capabilities of the USG medical emergency personnel to organize, respond, triage, and begin treating patients victimized by a radiological or nuclear event is estimated at no less than 24 hours.  Thus an obligation of this acquisition is to acquire products that have demonstrated efficacy in treating neutropenia (i.e., increase in the peripheral blood neutrophil counts) in appropriate animal models (FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, was established in 2002; see:  Federal Register 67: 37988-37998, May 31, 2002; 21 CFR 601.90 for biologics, and, 21 CFR 313.600-650 for drugs; (with possible human subject studies, if applicable), when administered at a minimum of 24 hours, and preferably greater than 48 hours, following acute exposure to ionizing radiation, and with no pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Other requirements:  (1) delivery of 100,000 treatment courses for neutropenia; (2) Long-term storage temperature in the range of 2-8 degrees C; (3) A defined therapeutic regimen and dosing schedule for treatment of radiation-induced neutropenia; (4) Treatment of neutropenia arising from ARS with the FDP must result in a 30% increase in survival from lethal exposure to ionizing radiation relative to controls (i.e.,LD50, the dose of ionizing radiation which results in 50% lethality in untreated irradiated subjects), plus an increase in neutrophil count. (5) have an acceptable safety profile; (6) have a minimum expiry period of 36 months with 30 months remaining when delivered to the SNS; (7) support a CDC-held IND for contingency use or CDC-held pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission; (8) prior to the end of the contract the therapeutic must be approved or licensed (NDA or BLA) for use as a therapy for neutropenia in adults (age: 18-64 years) exposed to ionizing radiation, (9) The USG reserves an option for safety studies in normal geriatric and pediatric populations; and (10) The USG reserves the right to exercise options to procure up to an additional 100,000 treatment courses.  It is imperative that the Offerors to this RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of their proposals so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices and guidance.

Additional details and requirements will be described in the Acute Radiation Syndrome solicitation, RFP HHS-BARDA-08-10 which will be made available electronically through FEDBIZOPPS on or about March 14, 2008.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.  This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for this solicitation.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number RFP HHS-BARDA-08-10, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  The contract award resulting from this solicitation will have an estimated award date of September 2008.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development Mission to Colombia (USAID/Colombia) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to conduct an independent evaluation of its human rights program.  The current USAID/Colombia human rights program began in August 2006. Implemented by Management Sciences for Development (MSD) through a five year contract consisting of a two-year base period and three option years, USAID/Colombia's human rights program is one of the largest USAID human rights programs in the world. Under this program, USAID/Colombia is assisting civil society organizations and government entities to implement a wide array of activities designed to promote respect for human rights and protect individuals and communities from human rights abuses.  USAID anticipates awarding a short-term cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract to evaluate progress, as well as the sustainability and impact of the program's interventions.  The results of the independent evaluation will contribute to USAID's decision about exercising the option years.
The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFPs will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed by e-mail to Nubia Farfan, nfarfan@usaid.gov and Sunil Xavier, sxavier@usaid.gov .

<p>General Services Administration's (GSA) Greater Southwest Region has a need for electric power to operate its federal government owned and occupied buildings located within deregulated areas of the Texas ERCOT marketplace. Buildings are located in the TXU, Reliant, CPL and WTU (lines and wires) transmission and delivery service delivery areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>GSA is seeking cost effective proposals providing mostly <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">renewable wind generated</strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">electrical energy</strong> to be delivered to GSA facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successful offeror will supply electricity and transmission for various contract terms of 36, 60 or 120 monthly billing cycles generally beginning with the next available meter read after contract award, the current contract expires July 31, 2008. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The approximate one (1) year electric requirement is 134,000,000 kWh. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A presolicitation notice was issued February 8, 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government is seeking a fixed price flat rate contract for an optimal term of ten years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will also request pricing for 3 year and 5 years terms in the alternative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the volatility of fuel costs and electricity prices, and the difficulty of determining where natural gas and other generation fuel markets are headed GSA requires stable supply and pricing. GSA has decided to address these issues by procurement of reliable, price stable and economical wind generated electric power to supply its facilities. Wind generated electric power is desirable because the wind will cost the same from year to year. Thus, procurement of wind energy, acts as a hedge against continually escalating fossil fuel energy prices, while providing environmental benefits. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Government is looking for a 50% wind generation as minimal percentage of the power supplied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Percentage of wind and renewable power will be evaluated as a part of the technical proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solicitation Documents will be uploaded within 15 days after posting date of this notice. The procurement will be in held in a two step bid process with the technical proposals and initial price proposals due May 19, 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technical proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation factors noted in the specification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Discussions may or may not be held.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government intends to award a contract(s) to the offeror(s) that offers the best value for each pricing group and meets the solicitation's minimum technical requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Multiple Awards may be made. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Supplier technical responses and initial price proposals will be due no later than 2:00 p.m. on May 19, 2008 at the address specified in the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors determined to be in the competitive range, will submit final pricing via GSA's Reverse Auction Website, and will be notified separately when the opportunity arises. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis; however the successful offeror will be required to be registered with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT) as a Retail Electric Provider (REP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any questions or requests for additional information should be directed in writing to Mrs. Natalie Holmes, Contracting Officer, at Natalie.Holmes@gsa.gov.</p>

The technologies are envisioned as a key component of a system that can prevent vehicles from being driven when the drivers' blood alcohol concentration (BAC) exceeds a preset threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety (ACTS) and the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration (NHTSA) have entered into a Cooperative Research Agreement, under the authority of  49 U.S.C. Chapter 301, to develop in-vehicle alcohol detection technologies as one strategy to combat the problem of alcohol-impaired driving.  This effort seeks to develop alcohol detection technologies that will quickly and accurately measure driver BAC noninvasively. These technologies will be a component of a system that can prevent the vehicle from being driven when the device registers that the driver's BAC exceeds the legal limit. Such devices ultimately must be compatible for mass-production at a moderate price, meet acceptable reliability levels, and be unobtrusive to the sober driver. The agreement seeks to assess the current state of impairment detection devices, and to support the development and testing of prototypes and subsequent hardware that may be installed in vehicles.</p>
<p>The following are examples of current technologies that have potential application.  Note that this list is not intended to be inclusive or exclusive, and companies are encouraged to propose other technologies for consideration:<br />-Near infrared spectroscopy<br />----Alcohol and metabolized alcohol bi-products<br />-Voice pattern recognition<br />-Volatile gas analysis<br />----Rapid ambient air analysis<br />-Transdermal Analysis<br />----Contact and evaporation sweat/perspiration analysis<br />----Transdermal blood gas analysis<br />-Ocular Movement and ocular blood gas<br />-Microwave analysis of bounded atmosphere<br />-Sonar detection of fluid content variations<br />-Touch/skin contact based diagnostics</p>
<p><strong>Requested Information</strong></p>
<p>This effort is part of a five year program to be funded by ACTS and NHTSA. Prospective sources possessing the qualifications, capability, and experience to respond to this RFI, are invited to submit documentation (no more than 15 pages) outlining the following items:<br />1.  Company background and information, to include point of contact, address, e-mail, type of company, documentation of business status (e.g., incorporation status, annual reports, regulatory filings, proof of capitalization, or other relevant information).<br />2.  Technical capabilities.<br />3.  Relevant technology development experience and credentials.<br />4.  Synopsis of experience and expertise of potential staff.<br />5.  Description of the technology to be utilized and its state of development.<br />6.  Relevant projects completed related to the anticipated objectives of the project with information on the client, scope, and products.<br />7.  Government references from other relevant contracts if available.<br />8.  Performance ratings received on other relevant contracts.<br />9.  Description of available facilities to perform the work.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></p>
<p>-Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI inclusive of answers to the requested information listed above.</p>
<p>-ACTS reserves the right to review late submissions but makes no guarantee to the order of or possibility for review of late submissions.</p>
<p>-Responses shall be limited to 15 pages in length single-spaced with font size twelve or larger and submitted via e-mail ONLY to RFI@dadss.org.</p>
<p>-The responses shall be in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word compatible format and are due no later than 5:00 PM (local Eastern Standard Time) on Monday May 5, 2008.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)
INTRODUCTION
The NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER WEAPONS DIVISION (NAWCWD) CHINA LAKE, and POINT MUGU, CA. is developing requirements for modular furniture utilization over a period of five (5) years. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist NAWCWD in formulating its requirements and identifying qualified sources who are able to provide valuable input as to process and industry standards.
This RFI is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  NAWCWD is conducting market research and desires input from industry to assist in requirements definition and planning. The information requested by this RFI may be used to facilitate a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a NAWCWD furniture contract by identifying requirements, standard industry terminology, and practices to aid in the decision making process. 
BACKGROUND
The Weapons Division was established to provide full-spectrum Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation for Naval Aviation Systems.  Our organization has a strong foundation with an outstanding workforce, many of who are internationally recognized.  We have world class ranges and numerous one-of-a-kind laboratories and facilities that are national assets.
China Lake is the Navy's largest single landholding. It represents 85 percent of the Navy's land for research, development, test, and evaluations use and 38 percent of the Navy's land holding worldwide. Located in the Western Mojave Desert region of California, approximately 150 miles north of Los Angeles, it covers more than 1.1-million acres - which is larger than the state of Rhode Island.  Point Mugu is situated on the Pacific Ocean, midway between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, California.  Point Mugu has real-time control of all air traffic within its coastal area, which permits dynamic reallocation of flight paths in order to assure safe, secure, unhindered military operations.  This enables the 36,000 sq. mile Pacific Sea Test Range to operate totally unencroached.  This range has been a major asset in the test, training and operational readiness of the majority of the sub surface, surface and aerial weapon systems in the DOD strategic and tactical inventories.Between the two sites, there are over 2,000 buildings, 6 million square feet, and three airfields, with a replacement value of close to $3 billion. Many highly specialized facilities are not duplicated anywhere else in the free world.  Annually, more than 32,000 official visitors come to conduct business or use the station's facilities and ranges.
PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Previously NAWCWD has procured modular furniture under simplified acquisition as needed. This method has resulted in a myriad of modular furniture styles and manufacturers that are incompatible and limited in reconfiguration. It is the goal of NAWCWD to standardize furniture style and manufacturer in order to manage an inventory of similar component parts. NAWCWD is comprised of multiple facilities which are in need of retrofit with modern, ergonomic, and space-efficient modular furniture systems.
NAWCWD is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help NAWCWD better define its requirements and obtain a contract management solution that meets its needs.  The intent is to use information provided by this RFI to generate a Request for Proposal (RFP) that will address and provide all possible solutions for free standing, attached, and modular furniture systems in existing facilities of many construction types and functional categories over a period of five (5) years, approximately 400-500 workstations per year.  
NAWCWD is interested in the identification of capable sources to provide command-wide furnishings as executed at centralized levels. With this information, NAWCWD will shape buying behaviors that satisfy command-wide furnishings needs by: 
1.	Minimizing duplication of effort of multiple purchases. 2.	Standardizing our corporate furniture procurement policy.3.	Providing purchasing flexibility.4.	Leveraging purchasing power.5.	Implementing strategies to reduce the total lifecycle cost of procurement.6.	Managing furniture assets and related services. 7.	Standardization of products or furniture systems.8.	Quick response time to tear down and reconfiguration efforts.9.	Convenient easy to use ordering structure represented in contract line items.10. Ability to Accommodate Multiple Communication Lines.
INFORMATION REQUESTED
Respondents are asked to provide any information deemed useful in developing the most effective and efficient approach to procuring and managing furniture assets and related services.  This includes business approach, contract type, performance risks, concerns and questions, and standard industry practices including but not limited to design, manufacturing, lead times, delivery, typical response time, installation, terms and conditions, billing schedules, and warranty.  Respondents are also asked to provide a preliminary list of office furniture subcategories to include seating typically used such as engineering, secretary/office manager, conference rooms, closed office spaces, executive offices, lobbies, etc.  These requirements will serve as a starting point to define workspace types and furnishings for varying support functions. 
For the purposes of establishing an interested sources list, respondents should submit company information including company name, address, telephone number, FAX number, point of contact(s) name(s), phone number, and e-mail address.  Include a capability statement that demonstrates ability to provide the furniture and perform the services discussed in this RFI. Capability information should include a brief description of experience in providing the type of furniture and support discussed in this RFI, as well as experience in working with other large organizations to drive total lifecycle cost reductions in the procurement and management of furniture assets and related services. This should include life cycle support cost, interchangeability, and projected availability of product line in the out years. Additionally, include a list of contracts with any government agencies. Address ability to provide Auto CAD .dwg files released in 2000 or later.   Information should be clear, concise, and complete and no more than 25 pages in length.  Respondents should provide website information and indicate whether website is government only.
DISCLAIMER
This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Any information requiring confidential or proprietary treatment should be marked as such.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned nor will respondents be notified of the result of the review.
HOW TO RESPOND: 
Please submit responses to this RFI via e-mail to Kim Matsunaga at kim.matsunaga@navy.mil.  Mailed responses can be sent to Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (Code 254200D), Attention:  Kim Matsunaga, 429 E. Bowen Road, Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, California 93555-6108.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only for a qualified service disabled veteran owned small business.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disadvantage and Large Business) relative to the NAICS Code 541611. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years.
After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and MUST respond to the following questions: 1) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 2) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 3) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 4) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 5) Are you a certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? In addition, the respondent must provide a capability statement which addresses the offeror?s qualifications to perform the work described below.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) requires the professional services of one full-time individual or two part-time individuals who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to continue the operation of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Workplace Helpline for a contract period of one year with four optional years.  The one full-time individual or two part-time individuals will work a maximum total of 40 hours per week.  It is estimated that an average of 8 to 10 inquiries are received per day.  The Helpline individuals will normally operate the Helpline Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays).    

In 1986, Presidential Executive Order 12564 required that each Federal Executive branch agency develop and implement programs to address drug abuse in their workplaces with a comprehensive program that would include a written policy, access to employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to oversee the development of the Federal-wide program and help agencies with implementation efforts.  In addition, HHS was required to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service for business and industry that would answer questions about drug abuse in the workplace.  The toll-free telephone service, which is the subject of this requirement was initiated in 1987 and has continued uninterrupted since.  Under the Reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration on October 1, 1992, the administrative responsibility for managing this telephone consulting service was transferred to the CSAP/SAMHSA.  In light of CSAP's prevention mission, the Workplace Helpline began to consult on alcohol issues and problems as well as drugs of abuse.  Additionally, the Workplace Helpline expanded its scope of coverage to include any community-based program whose mission is to reduce or eliminate the problems of alcohol and drugs of abuse in its community workplace.

The Workplace Helpline responds to a critical need on the part of its largest constituent-small businesses.  As has been the case since its inception, the Workplace Helpline receives most of its requests for assistance from small business owners (i.e., employee populations of 250 or less) who represent the vast majority of enterprise in the American economy.  Small businesses also represents the segment least informed and least involved in addressing workplace alcohol and drug abuse problems.  The Workplace Helpline also answers a significant number of calls by individuals inquiring about workplace drug testing and substance abuse prevention and treatment issues regarding prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol use.  The service is available to all 50 States and territories of the United States and has assisted employers from other countries.

This is not request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Division of Contracts Management, 1 Choke Cherry Road, Rockville, MD 20857 (Fed Ex: 20850), Attn: Janet M. Mattson, Contracting Officer.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received in writing no later than February 22, 2008 by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  

Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective bidders/offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources announcement.  No solicitation is currently available.

<SUBJECT>69--MOUT Assault Course (MAC)
<SOLNBR>M6785408R8069

<ARCHDATE>04182008
<CONTACT>Fred Boehne fax 407-381-8807fred.j.boehne@usmc.mil
<DESC>The government is seeking sources to for the procurement and installation of an automated target system in the existing facades located on the MOUT Assault Course (MAC) at Camp Lejeune NC.  The existing structures are constructed of wood and have been in place for several years.  The MAC has multiple bays that are about 50 yards wide and 200 yards deep, separated by earthen berms.  Only temporary targets have been used in the MAC to date.  The new target system will be computer operated using hand-held controllers.  A lighting system is required to create shadows throughout the MAC.
The contractor will be required to install a total of 25 computer controlled, programmable personnel targets of various types to create shooting scenarios for window targets, door targets rooftop targets and free standing targets.  Targets must rotate to be capable of presenting shoot/no-shoot presentations at the discretion of the controller.  Window targets (13 total) may have swing-up or swing across presentations.  Door targets (5) must provide swing-across presentations.  Free standing (7) targets must have swing-up movements and be protected with concrete coffins ground mounted on the range in locations designated by the government.  Lifting mechanisms must be hidden to the greatest extent possible and be provided with ballistic protection for the lifting mechanism designed to withstand errant rounds from weapons up to 7.62mm.  Movement and direction of fire on the MAC will be in a single direction so 180 degree protection is all that is required.  Targets must react t! o small arms rounds (7.62mm and below) and be programmable to require multiple hits at the discretion of the controller.  The contractor will provide lighting at twenty yard intervals on each side of the range to create shadows during night training and to provide for safety of movement in the event of mishap.  Individual lights must be able to be activated using the same controller that operates the target system. 
A separate control system must exist for each of the two bays and must operate independently without interference.  The control system must include a removable Toughbook type laptop computer (Mil Std 810F compliant) for automatic operation and allow targets to be controlled remotely using handheld devices.  There is no permanent range house at the MAC so all range control equipment must be removed from the range after each use to prevent pilferage.  Target lifters will remain on the range so must be anchored to the greatest degree possible.  The computer must be fully installed with programmable Windows-type software to operate the targetry.  The system must be programmable to allow facing of one, groups and/or all targets simultaneously.  It must also store pre-set scenarios to be chosen from a computer menu if desired.  The contractor will submit required documentation to the installation frequency manager to authorize controller frequencies for use.  
If a pneumatic operating system to power the range is used, the operating system must include an air compressor with dryer package to include: a pressure gauge, regulator, filter, an air-cooled after-cooler, and a desiccant dryer assembly.   The contractor will provide a shelter to protect the compressor from theft, vandalism and inclement weather.  Ricochet producing materials must be shielded.  The range has adequate impact barriers behind the targets.   The contractor must run all conduit and wiring from the targets to a central terminal adjacent to the firing lines.  Government electricians will connect power to the firing line terminals once final power requirements are known.
The award will be approximately $125,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice.

Workshop, DATE: May 1-2, 2008; REGISTRATION DEADLINE: April 24, 2008; </span></strong><span style="color: black;">TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Judah Goldwasser, DARPA/DSO, Email: </span><span style="color: blue;" lang="SV"><a href="mailto:Judah.Goldwasser@darpa.mil">Judah.Goldwasser@darpa.mil</a></span><span style="color: black;" lang="SV">; URL: </span><span style="color: blue;" lang="SV"><a href="http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm">www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm</a></span><span style="color: blue;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: blue;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of
Reactive Material Structures (RMS), DARPA is hosting a Proposer&rsquo;s Workshop that
will provide critical information regarding the program vision, milestones, and
opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to
respond to a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The
RMS program goal is to develop and demonstrate materials/material systems that
can serve both as high strength structural materials &ndash; i.e., capable of
withstanding high stresses &ndash; and which can also be controllably stimulated to
produce substantial blast energy. <span>&nbsp;</span>The
vision is to replace the inert structural materials currently used in munition
cases with reactive material structures that provide both structural integrity
and energy within the same material system, including the ability to rapidly
release the energy upon demand.<span style="color: #333399;"><span>&nbsp; </span></span>Specific technical challenges for the
program include development and demonstration of: (i) high strength, high
density materials/material systems that incorporate large enthalpy, reactive
ingredients; (ii) the capability to tailor the microstructure/architecture so
that the material/composite can be induced to undergo rapid and massive failure
to produce combustible ingredients with very large surface areas; and (iii) the
mechanism(s) to convert consolidated structural material into large surface
area powder, disperse, and ignite the powder to produce a high intensity
blast.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further program details and
milestones will be specified in a forthcoming BAA.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">The RMS Proposer&rsquo;s Workshop will be held at </span>The
Executive Conference Center,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3601 Wilson Blvd Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201, 8:30am-4:00pm ET, May 1-2<span style="color: black;">, 2008; and will consist of information, poster, and
discussion sessions.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the information
session overview presentations will be given by Government personnel to: (a)
introduce the research community to the RMS program vision and goals; (b)
explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this
particular effort; and (c) encourage and promote teaming. <span>&nbsp;</span>This will be followed by a poster session to
facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. <span>&nbsp;</span>There will also be an open discussion session
to provide the opportunity for participants to interact with Government
personnel and have their questions answered. <span>&nbsp;</span>The latter part of the first day and all of
the second day has been reserved for individual sidebar discussions with the
Program Manager.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further details are
available on the registration website listed below.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Potential
participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise, <span style="color: black;">facilities, and capabilities </span>to address all of the RMS
program&rsquo;s technical challenges will be crucial to its success. <span>&nbsp;</span>The multidisciplinary nature of this program
will require diverse sets of skills and expertise to develop total solutions to
the program objectives and achieve all of the program goals and milestones.<span style="color: #333399;"> <span>&nbsp;</span></span>DARPA will
not be funding the development of component technologies that address only a
subset of the program goals that will be described in the anticipated BAA. Since
an important element of the RMS Proposer&rsquo;s Workshop is to facilitate the
formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the BAA<span style="color: black;">, participants are encouraged to prepare posters describing
areas of capabilities to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming
discussions during the poster session. </span><span>&nbsp;</span>In addition, an information and teaming
website, <a href="http://www.sainc.com/RMSTeaming">http://www.sainc.com/RMSTeaming</a>,
has been established to aid in the process.<span style="color: red;"><span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting
location, and lodging are given on the registration website at: </span><span><a href="http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/view/index.asp?meetingid=593">http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/view/index.asp?meetingid=593</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;;"></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice announces FPI's intentions to produce solar panels on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status. This encompasses<a name="BM_1_"></a> all solar panels classified in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 6117 - Solar Electric Power Systems.</p>
<p>Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI's Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product. FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date. It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).</p>
<p>Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI's Board of Directors. All written correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC><p>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), Threat and Consequence Assessment Division (TCAD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a modification to extend the current contract no. EP-C-06-074 to include 3 Option Years, with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL), under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. This modification aims to complete the drinking water module for the automated syndromic surveillance software called Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE). Expansion and implementation of the ESSENCE water module shall include: (1) the addition of at least two additional health effect nodes; (2) extend the water utility detection framework to include customer complaint data; (3) validate water quality node through expansion to at least two other water utilities; and (4) pursue the use of the water module in other ESSENCE jurisdictions.</p>
<p>EPA source research indicates that JHU APL is uniquely qualified to enhance the ESSENCE software tool based on the fact that it developed ESSENCE and only JHU APL personnel have access to ESSENCE's source code and algorithms. This notice is not a request for quotations. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the performance work statement. Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. See numbered notes 22 and 26.</p>

<SUBJECT>19 -- Request For Information - Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-CCPMO-CCM8
<ARCHDATE>02202008
<CONTACT>Sandra L Smith, Phone 813-826-7335, Email smiths1@socom.mil
<DESC>Reference: RFI-CCPMO-NGCC dated 21 June 2007, provided a description of a next generation combatant craft for US Special Operations Command.  The requirements have been refined and an acquisition program is anticipated that will surpass existing 11M Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat (NSW RIB) capabilities and performance.  This new program is hereinafter referred as the Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM).  The following information provides the refined requirements for this craft.
Description: The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Combatant Craft Program Management Office is conducting this industry survey to determine available contractor base for the design/build of the Special Operations Combatant Craft, Medium (CCM).  Special Operations Forces (SOF) requires a tactically sized, highly reliable, reconfigurable, combatant craft capable of operating from land or maritime platforms.  The primary mission of CCM will be to provide for insertion/extraction of SOF into hostile/denied littoral/coastal areas as well as to provide tactical surface mobility for visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations.

General Note: The terms threshold and objective are used throughout this document.  Threshold is defined as the minimum acceptable operational value.  Objective is defined as the desired operational value beyond which any gain in utility does not warrant additional expenditure.  

Program Timeline/Strategy: Draft RFP to follow in 4th Qtr calendar year 2008.  Expect Formal RFP release in 1st Qtr calendar year 2009. Multiple contract awards for prototype fabrication and testing planned in 4th Qtr calendar year 2009.  The number of awards is contingent upon receipt of acceptable contractor proposals and available funding.  Results of testing will be used to select a single contractor for CCM production and logistic support.  Projected production is for 24 craft over a three to four year period. Selected contractor(s) will be required to deliver a prototype CCM for government testing 12 months after contract award.

Craft Requirements:
The craft on trailer shall be capable of air transport in C-130, and capable of airdrop from C-17.  
	Principal Characteristics are estimated to be: LOA 43 ft, Beam 8.75 ft, Height (on trailer) 8.5 ft.

Total weight of craft shall not exceed 20,500 pounds (Threshold equals Objective).
Total weight of the craft is the sum of: lightship craft, fuel, and variable payload. 

Craft variable payload shall be at least 4,500 pounds (Threshold) and 7,750 pounds (Objective).  Craft variable load includes four (4) crew with personal combat gear (allocate 1000 lbs), nine (9) combat-equipped SOF personnel (allocate 2500 lbs), and mission equipment (allocate 1000 lbs).
 
Cruise speed shall be at least 40 knots (Threshold) in 4 foot combined seas.
The cruise speed objective value is 55 knots in 6 foot combined seas.   

Range, at specified cruise speed, shall not be less than 270 nm (Threshold) in 4 foot combined seas. The range objective value at specified cruise speed, is 330 nm in 6 foot combined seas.

Sprint speed:  Responders may provide predicted sprint speed, in 3 foot combined seas and sustained for 30-minutes, at designated total craft weight.     

CCM will be a highly maneuverable craft and should include steering, +/- bow trim, and throttle response.  

CCM seakeeping vertical acceleration requirement at the specified cruise condition should not exceed 1.05g (RMS). CCM design will incorporate shape, form, and function specifically intended to counter the physical stress, strain, shock and vibration energies imparted to the crew and passenger personnel.  Human exposure for accumulated spine stress dose (Sed) normalized to an 8 hour exposure should not exceed 4.7Mpa (Threshold) and 3.9Mpa (Objective).  Eight hour operating profile may include as many as 5 hours at the specified cruise condition (40kts in 4ft combined seas).  Human exposure limits Sed8 values should be based on ISO 2631 Part 5 Health Hazard Assessment for Repeated Impacts.  Additional human exposure information may be provided with the RFP. 

Responders should propose a modular remote stabilized weapon system.  The system should be capable of effectively engaging a surface target at 1 kilometer and should have a coverage of 300 degrees arc of fire.  The weight of this module will be a  component of the variable payload.

CCM shall encompass both low detectability and low vulnerability. CCM requires a total-craft approach to balance high performance attributes with other survivability attributes.  The optimum balance of the CCM craft attributes will satisfy power and performance requirements as well as specific requirements that will be called out later in a classified attachment to the RFP.  These requirements will cover the areas of radar, infra-red (thermal) detectability of the craft with passengers and equipment in place. 

Responders are alerted now that they must meet facility and personnel security clearance requirements for handling and storage of classified material up to SECRET level in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) in order to be granted access at the time of RFP release to this classified attachment. 

Contractor designs should provide an open-architecture electronics system that integrates craft controls, navigation, propulsion systems monitoring equipment, government-furnished tactical communications equipment, FLIR, remote stabilized weapon, and potentially a commercial satcom communications system.  

A government-furnished tactical communications equipment package may require additional space and weight provisions independent of typical console mounted equipments.  Estimate 10 cubic feet and 150 lbs for this package.  This weight will be a part of lightship. 

Contractor designs should provide for clear, unobstructed topsides to minimize damage. Elimination of traditional electronics/antenna masts will reduce maintenance.  Designs should incorporate use of conformal and low profile antennas where possible.  Estimate thirty (30) square feet of available topsides area populated with conformal or low profile antennas.

Government furnished electronics suite and antennae information will be detailed in the RFP.  In response to this RFI, please indicate your experience and capability to integrate low profile antennae to optimize communications system performance.

Mean time between operational mission failures (MTBOMF) Threshold for the total CCM system shall not be less than 49 hours.  MTBOMF Objective is 104 hours.   Reliability metric exists such that the failure free operation of the following equipments/systems combined must not cause a mission failure: Hull and Structure, Main Engines, Transmissions, Propulsor, Driveshafts and Steering/Trim system, Alternator/ voltage regulators, Engine starters, Integrated control/monitoring system, Navigation  system, Human Shock mitigating system.  

CCM service life is projected at 7 years.  The government will require government purpose license rights along with production drawings of the top-side arrangements and components.  

Responses to this RFI should include when available: 
a) A detailed description of product and information on how the product meets the specified capabilities.  When addressing the ability to meet specific craft performance requirements please substantiate claims with data or demonstrated satisfactory performance of parent craft.

i) Please indicate current ability to meet clearance requirements for classified material up to SECRET level.

When preparing responses to this RFI: 
a) Please limit submission package to 30 pages.  Do not include company marketing material, corporate profiles, personnel resumes, or duplicate material from a corporate website.  If this information is indeed pertinent to the RFI, then provide a document reference sheet as an index for later use. 
b) Please submit responses electronically in .pdf format.
c) For those companies that provided a response to the referenced 21 June 2007 RFI (RFI-CCPMO-NGCC), and that desire to submit a response to this RFI, please provide a new submission package in accordance with the preparation instructions contained herein, for ease of government evaluation.

Optional Craft Demonstration:

As part of USSOCOM industry evaluations, the command offers interested companies an opportunity to showcase their existing craft in a limited series of performance trials.  These trials will be conducted at the contractors desired location, within the US, with the craft under the control of the contractors personnel.  A small Government team of evaluators will witness the trials.  The Government team will consist of approximately four technical personnel.  USSOCOM is primarily interested in evaluating craft displacement and observing sprint speed, cruise speed, and fuel burn rate in 3-4 foot combined seas.  Anticipated onboard test equipment will be a small handheld GPS and several accelerometers.  A standardized sea trial report form will be used for data collection.  Data collected will be protected by the government as company proprietary and will not be shared with other companies, design firms, or propulsion equipment suppliers/manufacturers.  The Government offers to provide the data recorded for the respective company craft upon request.

If responders have a diesel-powered parent craft between 37 and 47 feet and are willing to demonstrate that crafts performance, please indicate a desire to do so in your RFI response.  Also, provide the name and contact information (phone/email address) for the person at your location who will assist with coordinating/scheduling the performance trials with the Government coordinator.  USSOCOM expects the trials to be scheduled sometime in March 2008 and will last no more than one day for each contractor.  Companies are advised that the demonstrations will be conducted at no cost to the Government and that no discussions, suggestions, or recommendations in regards to the CCM program will be permitted.

The Point of Contact for this RFI is Mr. Bill Boudreaux at 813-826-6101.   Electronic responses in PDF or standard commercial format should be sent to: boudrew@socom.mil.

This is a request for information only and may or may not result in the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to this notice may not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly. Classified information will be accepted, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.  All responses are due no later than 45 days after this announcement date.

<DESC><p>As a member of the Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET), the United States Border Patrol has developed an excellent working relationship with other U.S. law enforcement agencies as well as Canadian law enforcement entities such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian Border Services Agency, and various provincial police entities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This partnership has resulted in the necessity for regular cross border activity of our agents driving government owned vehicles on official business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the United States our vehicles are self insured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current laws forbid us from self insuring outside of the United States.For this reason the United States Border Patrol is currently exploring the available options for purchasing insurance coverage which would cover our vehicles and drivers during those occasions when driving into Canada is necessary for official duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would require coverage that meets the legal insurance obligations for those Canadian Provinces that border the United States, which are British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our current requirements would be coverage for 206 vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would need the ability to change vehicles covered as our fleet vehicles are replaced, as well as the ability to add additional vehicles to the policy, if operational requirements dictated. The Office of Field Operations (OFO) requires insurance coverage for vehicles and drivers who travel into Canada for official duty. Insurance coverage is of major concern for the Field Office(s) given that CBP Officers who work at the various ports along the Northern Border are required to enter Canada on a recurring basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The OFO Field Offices have multiple land ports of entry along the Northern Border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CBP Officers are regularly required to enter Canada to meet with Canadian officials, Canadian law enforcement, and Canadian Customs counter parts. Due to irregular geographical borders, CBP Officers must enter Canada to travel between our own ports of entry on a regular basis because of mileage, cost, and time restraints.Although the government issued vehicles are self insured in the United States, current laws forbid from self insuring outside of the United States. As a result, CBP Officers may be placed in situations where they can be held personally liable if involved in an automobile accident in Canada without Canadian liability coverage.Some example of CBP employees traveling to Canada on Official Business are as follows: CBP Officers assigned to the Blaine POE travel to Canada regularly to work at the NEXUS Office located in British Columbia</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">The Area Port of Sweetgrass contains the Ports of Chief Mountain, Piegan, Del Bonita, Sweetgrass, Whitlash, Wildhorse and Willow Creek.&nbsp; This encompasses approximately 180 miles of the Canadian Border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In many instances when traveling from one Port to another, the most direct route is via Canada.&nbsp; This is due to the location of roads in each country.&nbsp; In the United States, nearly all the primary and secondary highways are located 40-60 miles south of the actual border, while in Canada in many instances, their highways are located within 10-30 miles of the actual border.&nbsp; For example, when traveling from the Port of Sweetgrass to the Port of Piegan, the mileage when traveling via the United States is approximately 130 miles, the mileage when traveling via Canada is approximately 90 miles.&nbsp; This makes a round-trip savings of 80 miles.&nbsp; In another example, when traveling from the Port of Sweetgrass to the Port of Del Bonita, the mileage when traveling via the United States is approximately 72 miles, the mileage when traveling via Canada is approximately 50 miles.&nbsp; This makes a round-trip savings of 44 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, when traveling from the Port of Sweetgrass to the Port of Whitlash, a savings of approximately 25 miles each way for a round-trip savings of 50 miles can be realized.&nbsp; </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">If CBP is able to eliminate on an average of 1 hour of driving, this will equate to many more work hours and increased productivity.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">We have considered the option of renting vehicles for travel to Canada, and buying liability insurance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only would this be a great expenditure but car rental agencies are not always available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example in the Port of Sweetgrass the IBET (Integrated Border Enforcement Team) member needs to travel to intelligence meetings with the RCMP in Raymond and the Lethbridge Police Departments.&nbsp; Based on our location, there are no car rental agencies within 100 miles.&nbsp; </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">There is an ACE ambassador at the Port of Sweetgrass who has been invited to Trade Outreach presentations in Lethbridge and Calgary, Alberta.&nbsp; In the last instance, our officer was required to travel over 100 miles (one-way) to rent a car, drive back to the border, attend the seminar, and then drive over 100 miles (one-way) to return the vehicle.&nbsp; </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">The SFO Service Ports would like to be able to conduct WHTI outreach in Canada, however, at the present; the inability to use a government vehicle for this purpose is a major factor in our inability to conduct outreach.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">The DFO, Seattle, the Blaine Area Port Director and the Assistant Director of Border Security and Facilitation will be traveling more frequently to Vancouver to attend Olympics planning meetings as the date draws near.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Import Specialists frequently travel to Canada to conduct importer visits, NAFTA verifications and to participate in outreach opportunities with the trade and commercial carriers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are a significant number of importers located quite close to the border, and the city of Winnipeg is only 60 miles directly north of the Service Port office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of such easy access the Import and Entry Specialists often travel for the day to Canada to conduct mission essential business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">CBP Officers require coverage that meets the legal insurance obligations for those Canadian Provinces which our CBP Officers regularly visit. In addition, the Field Offices need the ability to change vehicles covered as our fleet vehicles are replaced, as well as the ability to add additional vehicles to the policy, if operational requirements dictated.</p>

Step 3- Filter and Score Sites:  During the crawling process, the contractor shall use technology to score and reviewed pages based on content, links, website transaction activity and other mal-content precursors. The scoring data will be used to determine which pages are forward to the Government analyst/representative for human confirmation. Step 4- Review & Confirm: Each site that meets the FDA content thresholds (as determined by the contractor?s scoring algorithms) shall be analyzed by the contractor to confirm such content meets FDA criteria. Step 5 -Action & Report: The confirmed violations shall be reported to FDA in a password protected and unique portal. The FDA shall have the ability to manage each record, add website specific data, and use tools to assist inmanagement of the targeted content violation. Step 6 -Monitor & Review: After the target areas have been established, the contractor shall examine each page for changes on a monthly basis.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), the Management and Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is requesting an expression of interest from prospective Vendors to provide existing technology to retrieve, open, segregate, characterize, treat (as necessary), and repackage for final disposition remote-handled wastes stored at the INL. This expression of interest shall serve as a method of screening potential Vendors; allowing only qualified candidates to receive a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Arial;"><span>&bull;II.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">BACKGROUND</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The INL currently does not have the necessary capabilities to process all remote-handled wastes resulting from the Laboratory's nuclear-related missions. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Over the years, various DOE-sponsored programs undertaken at the INL have produced radioactive wastes and other materials that are classified as remote-handled (contact radiological dose rate &gt; 200 mR/hr). These materials include Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF), transuranic (TRU) waste, waste requiring geological disposal, low-level waste (LLW), mixed waste (both radioactive and hazardous per the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act [RCRA]), and activated and/or radioactively-contaminated reactor components. The waste consists primarily of uranium, plutonium, other TRU isotopes, and shorter-lived isotopes such as cesium and cobalt with radiological dose rates up to 20,000 R/hr. The hazardous constituents in the waste consist primarily of reactive metals (i.e., sodium and NaK), which are reactive and ignitable per RCRA, making the waste difficult to handle and treat. A smaller portion of the waste is contaminated with other hazardous components (i.e., RCRA toxicity characteristic metals).</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: TimesNewRoman; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: TimesNewRoman; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Such remote-handled materials and waste at the INL are presently stored at the Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) Radioactive Scrap and Waste Facility (RSWF), a RCRA-permitted waste storage facility. The waste originated from the operation of three major hot-cell facilities at MFC and Experimental Breeder Reactors I and II (EBR-I and EBR-II). In many cases, the SNF and the various waste types are co-mingled within the same storage container necessitating the capability to remotely segregate SNF from the waste and segregate the various waste types to meet disposal facility waste acceptance criteria. Much of the waste is contaminated with sodium, also necessitating a remote sodium treatment capability; bulk sodium will also be encountered during management of the remote-handled wastes.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: TimesNewRoman; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: TimesNewRoman; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">A variety of storage containers and shielding configurations have been used at the RSWF since 1965. Material stored at the RSWF pre-1978 were placed in 11-in. diameter, 6-ft long, thin-walled waste containers (commonly referred to as paint cans), which were placed in 16-in. diameter, 12-ft 4-in. long, Schedule 10 sealed carbon steel pipes (RSWF liners) buried vertically in the ground. The paint can was then covered with gravel for shielding and the liner closed with a metal plate or the liner was closed with a 30-in. concrete and metal shield plug. Post-1978 to present, the material is placed in a double-can assembly referred to as an HFEF-5 can. The inner carbon-steel cans have a diameter of approximately 11.5-in and are 5 ft long with a bolted lid. The outer can assembly is 12.75-in. diameter stainless steel and is approximately 6-ft long. This double container configuration is then placed in a 16-in. RSWF liner and closed with a shield plug.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: TimesNewRoman; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: TimesNewRoman; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRoman;">Pre-1990 most of the RSWF carbon steel liners were not protected from corrosion. In the early 1990s the original 16-in. carbon steel liners containing material stored in the pre-1978 configuration were trans-located to new, cathodically-protected, 13.5-ft long, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>24-in. diameter, Schedule 10 carbon steel liners; HFEF-5 cans were transferred from the 16-in. liners to new cathodically-protected 16-in. liners. In addition to the storage configurations identified above, several variations of these configurations have been employed including a double-can configuration consisting of an outer 22.25-in diameter, 11.25-ft long outer can assembly; the associated inner can contains a payload of 0.5 cubic meters (5X that of the HFEF-5 can).</span></p>

The purpose of the planned project is to characterize, segregate, treat (as necessary), and repackage waste for shipment to a DOE-designated permanent disposal site(s). Spent fuel segregated from the waste during processing will be returned to the RSWF for continued interim storage pending future processing or disposal at a permanent, geologic repository.</span></p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four DME MACs under contract to CMS. The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME PSCs). These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function. The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare. The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to 1. coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); 2. provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; 3. provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; 4. develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs; and, 5. establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations. The successful offeror must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS. There are no exceptions to this requirement; offers which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration. In addition, the successful offeror: - must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days); - must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame; - will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier; - must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors; - must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and - must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes. CMS intends to issue a solicitation for a competitive procurement for the PDAC Contractor - Medicare Administrative Contractor (PDAC MAC). It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.</p>

<DESC>2008 Polaris Ranger XP 4 X 4 700 EFI
-Pro Track System is mounted and installed and FWS WILL KEEP WHEEL/TIRES AFTER INSTALLATION OF PRO TRACK SYSTEM
Specifications for ATV RW082404:  Minimum 700 cc engine, automatic transmission, 4 X4 all terrain dual passenger vehicle with tracks and cargo box.
Purpose of the ATV is to conduct avian influenza surveillance on Lake Alice NWR.  This 12,000 acre refuge is surrounded by thick layer of emergent vegetation (cattails)   Pickups or four wheelers are not able to traverse many of the mucky, wet, and thickly vegetated areas. Avian influenza surveillance is conducted regularly for 6 months each year.  Purpose of the ATV is to meet our needs for maintaining the big game fence at Sullys Hill National Game Preserve.
We are suggesting the purchase of a Polaris Ranger XP 4x4 700 EFI side by side with the Pro Track System.  This is a 40 horse power, twin cylinder engine, with automatic transmission.  Pro Track System is mounted and installed, and we also will receive the wheels/tires for use of this equipment at other times during the year. 
Consideration: Delivered price, Pass performance, repair parts available locally, product consistency with existing ATV fleet, warranty, availability, product literature, Purchasing a Polaris brand vehicle ensures that we will readily have parts and supplies available for maintenance and repair as needed from a local source.  This is the first track type vehicle that we will purchase, and maintenance will be slightly different from the routine ATV .Repair parts available locally:   We are 100 miles to the nearest city, so if we had to drive that distance to obtain parts or bring the vehicle in for repair that would be more burdensome and inefficient to refuge staff. Product Consistency:  Most of the ATVs we already own are Polaris brand.  Therefore, there could be sharing of parts and equipment.
Purpose for PurchaseWe are currently looking to purchase an all terrain dual passenger vehicle with cargo box that will meet our needs for maintaining the big game fence at Sullys Hill National Game Preserve (SHNGP) and to traverse remote areas of Lake Alice National Wildlife Refuge (LANWR).  First, at SHNGP, we have bison, elk, and white-tailed deer that are within a fence on about 600 acres.  It is imperative to refuge management and disease management that the fence is maintained throughout the year.  Of highest concern is the possible transmission of chronic wasting disease should the integrity of the fence be compromised.  Typically, in the summer we can use a four-wheel drive four-wheeler, and in winters where there is enough snow we can use a snowmobile.  However, during the fall, parts of the winter, and spring, it is difficult to access the fence line with these latter two vehicles because of muddy soil conditions and limited amounts of snow.

<DESC><p>The U. S. Food and Drug and Administration intend to award a competitive requirement for Internet Website Crawling, Filtering and Documentation. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation FDA-SOL-08-00539 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. This is a total small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 519130. The small business size standard is 500 employees. This is a firm fixed price contract. The period of performance is from effective date of award through 12 months plus four option periods. The contractor shall identify, confirm and rank websites engaged in targeted activity that meet FDA search criteria which will be given to the contractor at time of award. This requirement also includes website activity and site ranking criteria. Ranking is by the amount of website activity and by numbers of links to a site and by the sophistication and complexity of the appearance of the pages. FDA will provide a list of URLs and websites (target areas) to the contractor for persistent investigative and market research monitoring of specifically identified mal-content related to fraudulent bird flu products. The contractor shall provide internet crawling, investigation, market research, website filtering, and website documentation for the target sites. The contractor shall provide progress reports monthly and for high risk areas the contractor shall provide progress report(s) within one week. These reports include website target identification, target content, threshold, site filtering, scoring, site reviewing and confirmation. The contractor shall help the FDA manage its targeted mal-content merchants through a combination of proactive and persistent site analysis coupled with a detailed case management system that allows confirmation and data collection on suspected violations and merchants. The contractor shall supply all of the necessary personnel, supplies, equipment, and facilities to perform the following tasks. The contractor shall have the capability to manage a changing database of targeted mal-content merchants through a combination of proactive and persistent site analysis, investigation and market research coupled with a detailed case management system that allows analyst confirmation (and data collection) on suspected violations. The basic steps of the process are as follows: Step 1 - Identify Target Sites: FDA will provide the contractor with their known list of URLs and websites. The contractor shall identify all known and relevant pages associated with that list. The contractor shall crawl the internet to identify pages associated with specific content to be identified by FDA. Step 2 - Content Targets and Thresholds: The contractor shall crawl each page of the target areas to determine if any target content violations appear to exist.

<DESC><p>Please note changes in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BOLD/UNDERLINE.</strong></span></p>
<p>Training System Acquisition VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) Muti-Option Contract.</p>
<p>Naval Air Systems Command Training Systems Division (NAWC TSD) Orlando, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intends to issue a Request for Proposal on or about</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">01 MAY 2008</span></strong> with the intention to award a contract to upgrade the VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) under the Presidential Helicopter Program. This acquisition will award one base effort and have options for eight additional efforts. Offerors will have 30 days after the RFP published date, to submit proposals.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM EFFORTS: The acquisition will maintain configuration of the APTs and aircrew training with the Fleet aircraft along with a technology refresh to maintain the APTs in top efficiency. Commonality of VH-3D, VH-60N, and VH-71 Visual Systems/Databases is a goal of the program. The training device modification includes a visual upgrade, a technology refresh, the cockpit upgrade program (CUP), a flight model upgrade to incorporate the Carson rotor blade, correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs), an effort to maintain trainer concurrency with the VH In Service aircraft changes and modifications, and relocation of both devices to a new location on MCAF Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p>The base effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APTs Computational Technology and Visual Systems. The computational technology refresh will include replacement of the current host and image generator with a PC host, PC image generator and replace the existing visual database with Naval Aviation Simulator Master Plan (NASMP) Portable Source Initiative (PSI) database set. This upgrade will keep the APT at peek efficiency until the VH-60N helicopter is retired. New hardware will have commonality with the VH-71 CPT to the maximum extent possible. Visual Databases from the VH-71 CPT will be integrated into the APT. All additional efforts will be options on the resulting contract.</p>
<p>There will be an option effort to upgrade the VH-3D APT Computational Technology and Visual Systems as described above for the VH-60N APT. Another option effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APT to a glass cockpit and provide applicable modifications. The VH-60N aircraft is incorporating state of the art technologies that will provide improved electronic displays and upgrades pilot communications and navigation capabilities (glass cockpit). The upgrade will be utilizing avionics, equipment and software utilized by other DOD aircraft to maintain commonality and supportability for future life cycle support. The upgrade will require the removal of the current instrumentation system and the incorporation of glass cockpit multifunction displays and associated weapons replaceable assemblies/wiring. Some software conversion of the instructor operator station and new digital interface code will need to be written.</p>
<p>The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model to account for the new Carson main rotor blade. This program will replace the existing VH-3D metal Main Rotor Blades (MRB) with a newly designed composite MRB. The new MRB was designed by Carson Helicopters of Perkasie, PA utilizing NASA designed airfoil sections and state of the art materials. The rotor blade offers significant increases in performance and flight envelope over the current metal blades. Aerodynamic model data will be recorded via the VH-3D Lift Improvement Program and will be used to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model.</p>
<p>The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be the correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs) which will be divided in four different lots. The Government intends to award as many TECRs as possible at time of contract award depending on funding availability. The last option effort is for the relocation of both devices to a location within the boundaries of MCAF Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:</span> Varies per CLIN, Overall is 5 years.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sources:</span> Sources will be limited to the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Lot I Small business firms.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GFE/GFI Requirements:</span> The Government will provide most WRAs required from the B kit and cockpit peculiar hardware from the A kit for the VH-60N glass cockpit upgrade <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DURING FY09</strong></span>. EDT software and information may be used for developmental efforts. VH-60N and VH-3D APT IOS and host software in addition to each APTs document library may be made available upon contractor request. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security Considerations:</span> If a foreign company is a subcontractor, the prime contractor will be responsible for complying with the import/export treaties. The use of foreign nationals inside of the HMX-1 squadron spaces may require Secret or above security clearance. The APTs are unclassified. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proprietary Data:</span> The VH-60N and VH-3D APTs were procured with full data rights. The contract will require contractors to provide data without restrictions on documentation and software. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Approach:</span> The acquisition will be made via the Small Business open competition under Lot I of the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) contract as Firm Fixed Price. Contract payment schedule will be performance-based payments based on significant milestone events. Events are not limited to, but include engineering design reviews, testing events and delivery of documentation. A percentage of the total contract value will be assigned to each event. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management Approach:</span> All efforts will be conducted by utilizing the Integrated Product/Process Development (IPPD) approach. An Integrated Product Team (IPT) will be formed with appropriate roles and responsibilities delineated by team assignment agreement for government personnel. The contractor will provide personnel for those teams.</p>

Does this refer to a full calendar year or to a shortened academic year?

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANSWER: Total is about 11 months</span></p>

Is there any flexibility in the timing of these sessions - such as one three week session at the commencement of the program; a two week mid-program session and a final one week wrap up session? We ask this because in our experience running our own degree programs involving both on-campus and online learning there are significant benefits to be derived from building in a midcourse on-campus session to permit better communication between participants and faculty and to allow for additional reinforcement of some of the learning objectives.<span style="COLOR: navy"> </span></span></p>

For example, your item "Situational Leadership" would be an aspect of our course material wherein we address adaptive and transformational leadership skills in the context of teaching the participants a variety of mechanisms for effecting change within organizations. We also would want to incorporate addressing a systems approach to identifying leadership challenges and formulating solutions.

Do you absolutely require a ropes course? Or is that offered only as an example of a leadership building exercise? Also, are we to assume that the "six week service project" is to run concurrently with the six weeks spent on-campus or is it meant to be an additional six week commitment outside of the on-campus learning sessions and the two 12 week internships?<span style="COLOR: navy"> </span></span></p>

<p>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract to OnPointe Corporation for expert contractor independent validation and verification (IV &amp; V) of the Census Bureau's Wireless Network (CEN 28) Security Test and Evaluation on a noncompetitive basis. The objective of the IV&amp;V is to verify and validate the results of the CEN 28, conducted on the pilot network, are still valid after CEN 28 has been placed into full production in the Building Modernization and Consolidation Project. This penetration testing is to determine if the Novell ID Manager, a critical system, has any vulnerabilities. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. If no affirmative written response is received by April 9, 2008, a contract may be issued to OnPointe without further notice.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this modification is to further articulate/clarify the Government's requirement.  The information that has been previously provided is a baseline for what the Government desires.  Companies are encouraged to submit their product information that is similar, meets, or exceeds the specifications provided.  The Government used Motorola products as a baseline due to their familiarity with the product, specifically, Motorola's Model I, ASTRO XTS 5000, XTVA Transportable Base Station, and Quantar Station Repeater.  MARSOC is not endorsing this product.  The intent of the sources sought is to find companies that can provide hand-held radios with similar capabilities.  The market research conducted will be used to assist in making an informed decision on what capabilites exist in the market place and whether or not a formal solicitation should be issued.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to perform Pricing, Data Analysis, and Coding (PDAC) services for all four DME MACs under contract to CMS. The PDAC contractor will be the single organizational entity responsible for providing specified support functions to CMS contractors that adjudicate Medicare claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) and/or perform program integrity functions with respect to such Medicare DMEPOS claims (i.e., the DME MACs and the DME PSCs). These support activities facilitate processing DMEPOS claims and include pricing, coding, and policy development; additionally, they provide statistical analysis in support of the program integrity function. The PDAC MAC was developed because of the unique and specialized requirements that distinguish DMEPOS suppliers, claims processing, and statistical analyses from other similar functions (i.e. fee-for-service) under Medicare. The primary functions of the PDAC MAC are, at a minimum, to 1. coordinate the development of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies in support of numerous Medicare DMEPOS claims processing-related functions (e.g., policy development, claims processing, program integrity, and medical review); 2. provide Medicare coding guidance and advice to the DMEPOS supplier community and other stakeholders including Medicaid State Agencies, MACs, carriers, and fiscal intermediaries; 3. provide statistical analyses of regional and national DMEPOS claims data to CMS, the DME MACs, the DME PSCs, the National Supplier Clearinghouse MAC, and law enforcement in support of program integrity and medical review activities, including policy development; 4. develop and maintain a cross-walk to be used in processing claims between HCPCS codes and the National Drug Code for certain drugs; and, 5. establish and distribute pricing files for oral anti-cancer drugs to DME MACs in support of their claims processing operations. The successful offeror must have current and direct access to and experience with Medicare DMEPOS claims data through one or more Medicare systems such as the Common Working File system and substantial experience in administering CMS-contracted Medicare activities involving DMEPOS. There are no exceptions to this requirement; offers which do not clearly demonstrate such access and experience will not be given further consideration. In addition, the successful offeror: - must have the capability to conduct sophisticated and complex statistical analyses and be capable of achieving full production mode in a very short time frame (i.e., 30-60 days); - must provide or recruit staff (i.e., medical director/pharmacist, nurses, statisticians, etc.) to perform the functions described in this notice within a very short time frame; - will be required to determine the best approach for absorbing this workload from the current Statistical Analysis DME Regional Carrier; - must develop and maintain a web-based data and analytical support infrastructure that can be accessed by CMS and contractors; - must develop and maintain a web-based system for making DMEPOS coding information available to suppliers and the general public; and - must appropriately review and test products and assign appropriate HCPCS codes. CMS intends to issue a solicitation for a competitive procurement for the PDAC Contractor - Medicare Administrative Contractor (PDAC MAC). It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period plus 4 option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of the RFP on or about August 30, 2007, and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before December 1, 2007.</p>

<DESC>2008 Polaris Ranger XP 4 X 4 700 EFI
-Pro Track System is mounted and installed and FWS WILL KEEP WHEEL/TIRES AFTER INSTALLATION OF PRO TRACK SYSTEM
Specifications for ATV RW082404:  Minimum 700 cc engine, automatic transmission, 4 X4 all terrain dual passenger vehicle with tracks and cargo box.
Purpose of the ATV is to conduct avian influenza surveillance on Lake Alice NWR.  This 12,000 acre refuge is surrounded by thick layer of emergent vegetation (cattails)   Pickups or four wheelers are not able to traverse many of the mucky, wet, and thickly vegetated areas. Avian influenza surveillance is conducted regularly for 6 months each year.  Purpose of the ATV is to meet our needs for maintaining the big game fence at Sullys Hill National Game Preserve.
We are suggesting the purchase of a Polaris Ranger XP 4x4 700 EFI side by side with the Pro Track System.  This is a 40 horse power, twin cylinder engine, with automatic transmission.  Pro Track System is mounted and installed, and we also will receive the wheels/tires for use of this equipment at other times during the year. 
Consideration: Delivered price, Pass performance, repair parts available locally, product consistency with existing ATV fleet, warranty, availability, product literature, Purchasing a Polaris brand vehicle ensures that we will readily have parts and supplies available for maintenance and repair as needed from a local source.  This is the first track type vehicle that we will purchase, and maintenance will be slightly different from the routine ATV .Repair parts available locally:   We are 100 miles to the nearest city, so if we had to drive that distance to obtain parts or bring the vehicle in for repair that would be more burdensome and inefficient to refuge staff. Product Consistency:  Most of the ATVs we already own are Polaris brand.  Therefore, there could be sharing of parts and equipment.
Purpose for PurchaseWe are currently looking to purchase an all terrain dual passenger vehicle with cargo box that will meet our needs for maintaining the big game fence at Sullys Hill National Game Preserve (SHNGP) and to traverse remote areas of Lake Alice National Wildlife Refuge (LANWR).  First, at SHNGP, we have bison, elk, and white-tailed deer that are within a fence on about 600 acres.  It is imperative to refuge management and disease management that the fence is maintained throughout the year.  Of highest concern is the possible transmission of chronic wasting disease should the integrity of the fence be compromised.  Typically, in the summer we can use a four-wheel drive four-wheeler, and in winters where there is enough snow we can use a snowmobile.  However, during the fall, parts of the winter, and spring, it is difficult to access the fence line with these latter two vehicles because of muddy soil conditions and limited amounts of snow.

<DESC><p>Please note changes in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BOLD/UNDERLINE.</strong></span></p>
<p>Training System Acquisition VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) Muti-Option Contract.</p>
<p>Naval Air Systems Command Training Systems Division (NAWC TSD) Orlando, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intends to issue a Request for Proposal on or about</span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">01 MAY 2008</span></strong> with the intention to award a contract to upgrade the VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) under the Presidential Helicopter Program. This acquisition will award one base effort and have options for eight additional efforts. Offerors will have 30 days after the RFP published date, to submit proposals.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM EFFORTS: The acquisition will maintain configuration of the APTs and aircrew training with the Fleet aircraft along with a technology refresh to maintain the APTs in top efficiency. Commonality of VH-3D, VH-60N, and VH-71 Visual Systems/Databases is a goal of the program. The training device modification includes a visual upgrade, a technology refresh, the cockpit upgrade program (CUP), a flight model upgrade to incorporate the Carson rotor blade, correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs), an effort to maintain trainer concurrency with the VH In Service aircraft changes and modifications, and relocation of both devices to a new location on MCAF Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p>The base effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APTs Computational Technology and Visual Systems. The computational technology refresh will include replacement of the current host and image generator with a PC host, PC image generator and replace the existing visual database with Naval Aviation Simulator Master Plan (NASMP) Portable Source Initiative (PSI) database set. This upgrade will keep the APT at peek efficiency until the VH-60N helicopter is retired. New hardware will have commonality with the VH-71 CPT to the maximum extent possible. Visual Databases from the VH-71 CPT will be integrated into the APT. All additional efforts will be options on the resulting contract.</p>
<p>There will be an option effort to upgrade the VH-3D APT Computational Technology and Visual Systems as described above for the VH-60N APT. Another option effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APT to a glass cockpit and provide applicable modifications. The VH-60N aircraft is incorporating state of the art technologies that will provide improved electronic displays and upgrades pilot communications and navigation capabilities (glass cockpit). The upgrade will be utilizing avionics, equipment and software utilized by other DOD aircraft to maintain commonality and supportability for future life cycle support. The upgrade will require the removal of the current instrumentation system and the incorporation of glass cockpit multifunction displays and associated weapons replaceable assemblies/wiring. Some software conversion of the instructor operator station and new digital interface code will need to be written.</p>
<p>The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model to account for the new Carson main rotor blade. This program will replace the existing VH-3D metal Main Rotor Blades (MRB) with a newly designed composite MRB. The new MRB was designed by Carson Helicopters of Perkasie, PA utilizing NASA designed airfoil sections and state of the art materials. The rotor blade offers significant increases in performance and flight envelope over the current metal blades. Aerodynamic model data will be recorded via the VH-3D Lift Improvement Program and will be used to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model.</p>
<p>The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be the correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs) which will be divided in four different lots. The Government intends to award as many TECRs as possible at time of contract award depending on funding availability. The last option effort is for the relocation of both devices to a location within the boundaries of MCAF Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:</span> Varies per CLIN, Overall is 5 years.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sources:</span> Sources will be limited to the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Lot I Small business firms.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GFE/GFI Requirements:</span> The Government will provide most WRAs required from the B kit and cockpit peculiar hardware from the A kit for the VH-60N glass cockpit upgrade <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DURING FY09</strong></span>. EDT software and information may be used for developmental efforts. VH-60N and VH-3D APT IOS and host software in addition to each APTs document library may be made available upon contractor request. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security Considerations:</span> If a foreign company is a subcontractor, the prime contractor will be responsible for complying with the import/export treaties. The use of foreign nationals inside of the HMX-1 squadron spaces may require Secret or above security clearance. The APTs are unclassified. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proprietary Data:</span> The VH-60N and VH-3D APTs were procured with full data rights. The contract will require contractors to provide data without restrictions on documentation and software. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Approach:</span> The acquisition will be made via the Small Business open competition under Lot I of the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) contract as Firm Fixed Price. Contract payment schedule will be performance-based payments based on significant milestone events. Events are not limited to, but include engineering design reviews, testing events and delivery of documentation. A percentage of the total contract value will be assigned to each event. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management Approach:</span> All efforts will be conducted by utilizing the Integrated Product/Process Development (IPPD) approach. An Integrated Product Team (IPT) will be formed with appropriate roles and responsibilities delineated by team assignment agreement for government personnel. The contractor will provide personnel for those teams.</p>

Should we assume that this conflict is the result of a typo on Line 3.2? If so, what is the correct date for the first class?<span style="COLOR: navy"> </span></span></p>

Does this refer to a full calendar year or to a shortened academic year? This is significant as we compute the time required in on-campus classes and the two internship assignments as totaling only thirty (30) weeks.<span style="COLOR: navy"> </span></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANSWER: Total is about 11 months</span></p>

Is there any flexibility in the timing of these sessions - such as one three week session at the commencement of the program; a two week mid-program session and a final one week wrap up session? We ask this because in our experience running our own degree programs involving both on-campus and online learning there are significant benefits to be derived from building in a midcourse on-campus session to permit better communication between participants and faculty and to allow for additional reinforcement of some of the learning objectives.<span style="COLOR: navy"> </span></span></p>

For example, your item "Situational Leadership" would be an aspect of our course material wherein we address adaptive and transformational leadership skills in the context of teaching the participants a variety of mechanisms for effecting change within organizations. We also would want to incorporate addressing a systems approach to identifying leadership challenges and formulating solutions.

Do you absolutely require a ropes course? Or is that offered only as an example of a leadership building exercise? Also, are we to assume that the "six week service project" is to run concurrently with the six weeks spent on-campus or is it meant to be an additional six week commitment outside of the on-campus learning sessions and the two 12 week internships?<span style="COLOR: navy"> </span></span></p>

<p>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract to OnPointe Corporation for expert contractor independent validation and verification (IV &amp; V) of the Census Bureau's Wireless Network (CEN 28) Security Test and Evaluation on a noncompetitive basis. The objective of the IV&amp;V is to verify and validate the results of the CEN 28, conducted on the pilot network, are still valid after CEN 28 has been placed into full production in the Building Modernization and Consolidation Project. This penetration testing is to determine if the Novell ID Manager, a critical system, has any vulnerabilities. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. If no affirmative written response is received by April 9, 2008, a contract may be issued to OnPointe without further notice.</p>

<DESC>The intent of this modification is to further articulate/clarify the Government's requirement.  The information that has been previously provided is a baseline for what the Government desires.  Companies are encouraged to submit their product information that is similar, meets, or exceeds the specifications provided.  The Government used Motorola products as a baseline due to their familiarity with the product, specifically, Motorola's Model I, ASTRO XTS 5000, XTVA Transportable Base Station, and Quantar Station Repeater.  MARSOC is not endorsing this product.  The intent of the sources sought is to find companies that can provide hand-held radios with similar capabilities.  The market research conducted will be used to assist in making an informed decision on what capabilites exist in the market place and whether or not a formal solicitation should be issued.
