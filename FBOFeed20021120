<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083341744     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, hereby announces it's intention to award a non-competitive contract to Hartman Valve Corporation, 700 Capac Court, St. Louis, MO  63125, for replacement seals for two 100" butterfly valves at Anderson Ranch Dam, Idaho.    Hartman's unique process secures the rubber seal to the bronze seals to allow the proper interface with the butterfly valve leaf, prevents circumferential movement of the rubber seal inside the bronze one, and allows the seal to flex in shear rather than compression, which extends the life of the seal.   The seals at Anderson Ranch Dam have been leaking for many years, and Reclamation has been searching as long for ways to successfully replace the seals.  Hartman invented, and has patented, a seal replacement system that has successfully solved similar leakage problems at other Reclamation sites.  Reclamation feels the patented seal design is the answer to the leaking valves at Anderson Ranch Dam.  Hartman currently has the patent for the seal replacement system which is the most practicable source for Reclamation's needs.   The NAICS code 541720 and the size standard is 500.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 10 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on any responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Direct inquiries about this requirement to Marie Day, by telephone at 208-334-1744, by fax at 208-334-9606, or by e-mail to MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV.

<DESC>The Sierra Nevada Region (SNR) of the Western Area Power Administration has embarked on a project to integrate its existing information systems into more streamlined business processes.  The project involves integrating data and systems, automating workflow and business processes, and allowing greater enterprise access to legacy data.  To accomplish this, SNR will acquire an integrated Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and Web Portal software solution using source selection procedures and full & open competition. SNR's implementation has the potential to lead to a Western-wide acquisition of the same software solution.  This potential will be included as an option in the solicitation. SNR has prepared a detailed Statement of Work describing the minimum requirements the solution must provide.   Only proposals that can satisfy all of the requirements will be considered.  Proposals offering only an EAI or Web Portal solution will be eliminated as non-responsive.   The solicitation will also seek offers for related maintenance, training, installation and support. These elements may or may not be obtained through this acquisition. All responsible sources may submit a proposal.  When the solicitation is issued, it will include proposal submittal instructions and evaluation criteria.  Proposals which meet the requirements of the SOW will be evaluated to determine the best value to SNR.  After the initial evaluation, the Source Selection Authority will down-select to those offerors deemed most likely to receive the award.  The selected offerors will be invited to demonstrate their solution within specific confines.  Award will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror deemed by the Source Selection Authority to offer the best value to the Government.  The consolidated technical proposal rating, including the demonstration results, will be more significant than price.  The selection may include a trade-off between additional benefits offered and price.    A technically superior proposal may be selected over a technically inferior but less expensive proposal, only if the technical superiority is deemed worth the monetary differential.  In all cases, the price must be reasonable and realistic. This is a synopsis announcement of a planned acquisition.  The solicitation and statement of work will not be released for a minimum of 15 days from the publication date of this announcement.  The solicitation and the statement of work will be posted electronically at this location when they are available. Paper copies of the solicitation and statement of work will not be provided.

The Government intends to award up to 15 Full and Open contracts under this announcement. 


B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDBs transition from subcontractors to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.


Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in Section D North American Industrial Classifications System (NAICS). Descriptions of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).


C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use Full and Open Competition  under this announcement. The proposed Protege(s) shall qualify within the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D.

OPIC is a Federal agency of the U.S. Government. OPICs Department of Legal Affairs is charged with providing the agency with high-quality legal representation and advice in the most practical, efficient, and cost-effective manner. To assist it in discharging these responsibilities, OPICs Department of Legal Affairs engages, from time to time, outside counsel. A description of our mission and programs is found in the OPIC Program Handbook, a copy of which can be obtained from OPICs website at http://www.opic.gov.

The Lists will be utilized to solicit bids from law firms to act as outside counsel to OPIC on matters falling within areas of expertise for which OPIC maintains a List. The following Lists will be developed from this competition: (1) Project Finance List: Structuring, negotiation and documentation of international project finance transactions (typically, OPIC loans to projects ranging from $20 million to $250 million), and due diligence in connection with same; (2) Insurance Claims List: Arbitration (typically under AAA international arbitration rules) arising in connection with claims for compensation under OPICs political risk insurance policies; and (3) Investment Funds List: Structuring, negotiation, and documentation of secured loans to international private equity investment funds, and review of fund formation documents for compliance with OPICs program objectives.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) to complete a scholarly book-length manuscript on the history of the access to space.	The NASA History Office will administer this project and manage professional review and oversight of the final publication of the work. The scope of work shall include, but is not limited to the preparation of a book-length manuscript on Access to Space:  The Evolution of an Idea and Technology.  The goal of this research project is to produce an approximate 500-page manuscript history of the views of scientists, engineers, policymakers, enthusiasts, and the general public regarding the various methods conceivable and available to put humans and payloads into space.   Access to space has been the critical question in spaceflight since the beginning of the space age: how best and most efficiently to reach Earth orbit.	Reaching Earth orbit efficiently has been the key obstacle to overcome because once a payload has escaped most of Earth's gravitational pull, it is much easier for it to travel elsewhere in the solar system or beyond.  In addition, there are a number of kinds of applications satellites that function within Earth orbit itself. This work will present a conceptually challenging analysis of the manner in which humanity has thought about the methodologies of reaching Earth orbit (focusing on the twentieth century), exploring the various technologies conceived and developed.  It will describe the process of technological innovation that has led to the development of chemical rocket launch vehicles that presently exist, and will explore the debates over the use of expendable launch vehicles versus reusable rockets. It will also explore the possible other types of launch systems that have been considered such as nuclear, electromagnetic, laser, and ion propulsion technologies, in addition to hypersonic aircraft. The finished manuscript is to be delivered within three years and must reflect extensive research in NASA records, scientific journals, the records of other relevant government agencies (for example, the Smithsonian Institution, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy), personal paper collections, and private company archives.  The contractor should use oral history interviews as appropriate to augment written records as source material for this book. The contractor should transcribe the most significant oral histories and deliver them to the NASA History Office to make part of its Historical Reference Collection.  All of the research material, including interview tapes and transcripts, collected during the project will be archived with the NASA History Office, forming a coherent collection other researchers can use for future histories. Work Location: Work shall be performed at the contractor facility and at NASA Headquarters and relevant Field Centers.  The contractor shall carry out the project using contractor office space, equipment, and supplies; however, accommodations for workspace and photocopying will be made available to the investigator when researching in NASA facilities.   Period of Performance and Contract Type: The period of performance for this contract includes a 12-month base period and two 12-month option periods, not to exceed 36 months after contract award. NASA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,000 employees respectively.	The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9. The Government is contemplating conducting a full and open competition. However, in the event two or more small businesses submit capability statements which demonstrate the ability to successfully perform this effort, the Government will convert this effort to a small business set-aside. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 16, 2002, to Michele Hull at: mhull@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about December 23, 2002 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about January 23, 2003. The firm dates for the offer due date will be stated in the RFO. This procurement is being conducted under NASA Midrange Procurement Procedures (NASA FAR Supplement 1871).

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for a program entitled, ?DESIGNING NEW MODELS FOR EXPLAINING FAMILY CHANGE AND VARIATION.?   Based on a thorough interdisciplinary analysis and assessment of relevant research, theory, and scientific methods, NICHD seeks to develop a model (or models) for a coordinated research and data collection program reflecting an integrated approach to the study of family change and variation.   The model research and data collection program will integrate previously disparate streams within family research, including research on fertility, marriage and cohabitation, sexual behavior, and parenting, and will have the potential to significantly advance understanding of the factors and processes that drive family change at both the individual and societal levels. The model(s) may have several components which together comprise a coordinated program of research capable of testing specific, theoretically driven hypotheses while also serving as a resource for researchers addressing a broad set of policy-relevant and scientific questions. The model(s) should have the ability to expand and contract to respond to varying funding levels, and they should complement existing data and research resources related to family and fertility.  
The model research and data collection program will be developed under the direction of a Principal Investigator who is a noted expert in family, fertility and research design, in conjunction with a core working group. The working group will devise and implement strategies to seek input from population and other scholars in performing reviews of research and theory, conducting original methodological and theory-development research, and shaping and refining the design for the model research and data collection program.   The working group will develop a theory or set of theories to explain family change that integrate and build upon major approaches in different disciplines. The planning process and supporting research will be designed to consider theories from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g., anthropology, biology, demography, economics, family studies, policy, psychology, and sociology).  It will also consider methodologies drawn from a diverse set of disciplines and assess the potential of a variety of innovative research and data collection strategies. The working group will articulate the compatibilities and contradictions across theories and formalize the theories to be tested and the research and data collection design for testing them.   The working group will conduct original research, such as-meta-analytic research, qualitative studies, secondary data analyses, and methodological studies, as appropriate to review and integrate theory, review current scientific knowledge, conduct preliminary studies in un-researched areas, evaluate potential methodologies, design alternative models, evaluate models, and prioritize the models and/or component parts.  The working group will make substantial use of consultants, commissioned papers, working groups, committees and sub-committees, and workshops, as appropriate, to ensure that the model program reflects relevant expertise from the broadest possible set of disciplines and research areas.
The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or before December 5, 2002 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov .  All responses must be submitted on or before March 10, 2003, to:  Virginia A. DeSeau, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, Rockville, MD  20852).  Fully electronic copies will not be accepted, but portions of the proposal may be provided on disc.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is:  RFP NICHD-2003-03.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Plamen Nemchev, Director, Public Procurement Directorate, Council of Ministers, 1, Dondukov Blvd., 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria, Phone: 359-2-980-8516, Fax: 359-2-940-255-55  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a national IT network for the interconnection of government ministries in Bulgaria.

The Council of Ministers (COM) network provides infrastructure for both voice and data communication and connects public sector ministries and agencies to Sofia.  The COM is building this network to reduce dependence on the private sector and reduce the cost of communications among the government ministries and agencies.

The major goal of this study is to evaluate the requirements for the implementation of a national interconnection network of government ministries in Bulgaria.  The project would identify COM needs and look at the currently available solution packages that are considered acceptable by the industry.  The proposed study is aimed at the following general targets:
?	IT requirements analysis
?	Interconnection architecture and standards development
?	Implementation and procurement plan

The study will focus on coordinating the efforts of all parties involved, to develop one single national network, while providing significant cost savings.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $330,860 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

The Study is divided into two phases.  The USTDA Grant of US$330,860 is correspondingly divided into US$231,220 for Phase I and, prospectively, US$99,640 for Phase II.

Upon the completion of Phase I, Contractor shall submit the Phase I Report to the Grantee and to USTDA.  USTDA would consider providing the balance of USTDA Grant funding (US$99,640) for Phase II.  USTDA authorization to proceed with Phase II USTDA Grant funding would be set forth in a letter to the Grantee and to the Contractor.  USTDA is under no obligation to cover expenses incurred by the Contractor for Phase II if USTDA does not provide such written authorization to proceed.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., January 3, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>In response to a U.S. Marine Corps Urgent Need Statement, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to award a sole source contract to Pioneer UAV, Inc. (PUI), Hunt Valley, Maryland to deliver and install up to twenty (20) replacement EO/IR payloads for the Pioneer Air Vehicle (AV), and provide associated testing and logistics support.

Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of the Pioneer System design since production drawings are not available.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV, PUI is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the Pioneer design and system architecture.  Award to anyone other the PUI would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance is December 2002 to September 2003.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to mcloughlinm@navair.navy.mil.  Notes No. 22 and 26

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The above referenced BAA is modified to include a new Focal Challenge: "An Enduring, Personalized, Cognitive Assistant (EPCA)."  During the life of the BAA, other Focal Challenges may be introduced.  The EPCA Focal Challenge is an addition to the areas of interest described in the basic BAA, which include Computational Perception, Representation and Reasoning, Learning, Communications and Interaction Technology, Cognitive Architectures and Integrated Cognitive Agents, Robust Software and Hardware, Cognitive Teams, and Underlying Foundations. The intent of this Focal Challenge is to drive the creation of a new class of integrated, highly functional cognitive systems, central to the technical mission of this BAA and demonstrating the enabling technical elements (reasoning, learning, etc.) for new classes of cognitive information processing applications, as discussed in this BAA.  The Enduring Personal Cognitive Assistant will be set in an office context and will act like a personal executive assistant to a modern knowledge-worker or decision-maker.  The Assistant should demonstrate a number of key capabilities:  continuous learning over significant periods of time (months, if not years), and the ability to survive "injury," intermediate failure and even complete shutdown, whether intentional or inadvertent; this includes the retention of information and skills through system failure and shutdown (Enduring); the capability of autonomous as well as supervised learning, including learning by observing a partner or by being told something directly (at any natural level of abstraction) (Personalized); the capability to have and use domain and task knowledge; the capacity to be aware of events as they transpire and of the Assistant's own place in the world; the ability to have and remember experiences of its own, and to integrate perceptual input with longer-term knowledge; the ability to explain its reasoning and behavior in natural terms to its partner; and the ability to decide what to do and to act in real time (Cognitive); the capability of cooperating in a team or multi-agent situation; the capacity to interact in a multi-modal, broad spectrum way with humans (including natural language); the ability to be available everywhere; and the capacity to develop the degree of trust necessary for successful everyday interaction with a human partner (Assistant).  The Assistant must display basic competencies, including interaction with people and other assistant programs in a normal office environment; sending and receiving information in a human-like manner; relating office information and activities contained or described in one medium in a meaningful manner to office information and activities contained or described in another medium (e.g., relating email to calendar entries, phone messages to trips, etc.); and integration with off-the-shelf office technology solutions and applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Netscape Navigator).  Our vision is of an Assistant likely to be dedicated to a single person and working intimately with that person over a prolonged period of time (i.e., months).  In this long-term setting, the Assistant would observe the behavior of its partner and determine his/her habits and likes and dislikes, for example preferences in travel, information presentation, mail-reading behavior, appointment scheduling, etc.  The system must be able to respond to user feedback (either direct or implicit).  The Assistant should be able to accept direct natural language direction and advice, ranging, for example, from very specific orders to make a plane reservation to general rules of thumb about scheduling appointments.  We would ultimately like the Assistant to be accessible naturally and seamlessly in any environment and modality.  The Assistant must be capable of learning and reasoning - for example, learning new office procedures by being trained or directed by a human partner or ultimately, by reading a document describing those procedures.  As is a good human assistant, the artificial assistant should be capable of proactively accessing and using electronic information sources locally and on the Internet, for example, to prepare appropriate materials in advance of a meeting.  The Assistant must be robust in the face of uncertainty, being able to successfully cope with unanticipated external and possibly disruptive events.  The intent of the EPCA Focal challenge is to foster a cross-disciplinary integrated approach that significantly advances the state of the art both at the system level and in core technology.  It is essential that technologies and components developed in the course of this research be general enough to lend themselves to other applications (portability to other cognitive applications) - the goal (as is the goal of the entire BAA) is to create powerful and reusable cognitive information processing technologies and techniques rather than simply to create an ad hoc assistant system that serves only as a demonstration.  However, successful integration of the cognitive information processing technologies and components into a working overall system is paramount.  It is anticipated that there will be multiple awards, which will be reviewed at the 12-month milestone, to include a Preliminary Design Review and demonstration for determining continuation of the technological thrust being reviewed through the next milestones.  Proposals submitted in response to the EPCA Focal Challenge must specifically address milestones at the 12-, 24- and 36-month points.  At the 12-month milestone, for example, the contractor might address the analysis and development of the initial domain knowledge base; the types of learning algorithms needed to learn procedures and preferences by observation; the specification of the architecture for overall reasoning, decision-making, and learning for the system; and demonstrate elementary meeting scheduling capabilities and conflict resolution, and basic entity and event extraction from email and voicemail transcripts and correlation of such entities and events with calendar entries.  Continuing the example, at the 24-month milestone, the contractor might demonstrate simple advice-taking behavior; deeper integration of information across calendars, email, voicemail, etc.; simple preference-inferring behavior; rudimentary modification of information presentation based on stated or inferred user preferences, using confirmatory dialogues; and the initial interaction with other software agents and online sources.  At the 36-month milestone, to complete the example, the contractor might demonstrate natural language dialogue-based interaction; proactive information-seeking and preparation of appropriate materials in advance of events needing them (e.g., meetings); general reflective problem-solving to cope with unforeseen events and constraints; and more sophisticated interface behavior around modifications based on inference (e.g., non-annoyance of the user).  The establishment of milestones, while at the discretion of the proposer, should clearly provide demonstrable results of the research and integration cumulatively achieved by the team at the milestone described.  Proposals must discuss the use of phase or option years, to include fully defining the meaning of phase or option years.  Base and phase or option years must be fully priced, to the extent possible.  Deliverables, milestones, and demonstrations must be included and clearly defined with links to the Statement of Work.  Proposers must propose a multi-organizational but integrated team comprising a Lead System Integration (LSI) function and a set of Technology Focus Centers (TFC's).  The LSI function will have overall project management responsibility, to include chief architect and interface control functions, system integration of concepts from the TFC's, and concept validation and evaluation processes.  Technology Focus Centers themselves should be multi-organizational, and must reflect a broad and deep representation from the technical community with unique and enabling capabilities for each major technical sub-area of this Focal Challenge; they should participate in the design of all versions of the Assistant system built by the Lead System Integrator, recommend technology elements to the Lead System Integrator, and develop technology elements for all iterations of the architecture and technology concepts for all systems envisioned by the proposal.  All proposals must address the inclusion and use of a Technology Transition Committee, comprising DARPA representatives and LSI and TFC representatives.   Submitted proposals must clearly discuss the offeror's planned approach to the sharing of information and responsibilities within each Technology Focus Center and between Technology Focus Centers and Lead System Integrators.  The proposal must specifically address the proposer and team members' Intellectual Property rights, Government rights to Intellectual Property resulting from the research, and the methods to be used to meaningfully exchange possibly proprietary information among the awardees at the Lead System Integrator level and within the various LSI Integrator and TFC teams.  The proposer must specifically address the use of human subjects, if any, at any point during the life of the project.  If human subjects are not to be used, a statement of that fact must be included.  If human subjects are to be used at any time in the project, the proposer must meet all requirements of Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 46 Protection of Human Subjects, effective 13 December 2001, Department of Health and Human Services.  The Common Rule (Federal Policy) for the Protection of Human Subjects (56 FR 28003) may also be found at 32 CFR Part 219, Department of Defense.  If human subjects are to be used at any time during the project, the proposal must include Industrial Review Board (IRB) approval for the use of human subjects, or a plan for obtaining IRB approval for the use of human subjects prior to the use of the human subjects.  Although proposals identified for funding under this Focal Challenge may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors, the Government anticipates awarding only contracts in order to maintain the desired level of control over this research.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  For those proposals submitted directly in response to this modification to BAA 02-21, Focal Challenge: Enduring, Personalized, Cognitive Assistant, a submission date of 12:00 NOON (ET), 19 December 2002 is established for consideration during the initial evaluation phase.  Proposal cover sheets, as described in the basic BAA and Proposer's Information Pamphlet, should indicate the EPCA Focal Challenge as the BAA technology area for which the proposal is submitted.  Proposals should be submitted to the addresses contained in the basic BAA.  The 19 December 2002 submission date applies only to proposals submitted in response to the Focal Challenge.  Due to the extremely short submission time, no abstracts responding to the Focal Challenge are required or will be accepted.  All other submission requirements, formatting requirements, and reporting requirements remain the same as found in the initial solicitation describing the BAA.  Offerors are still encouraged to submit other proposals addressing the issues in the basic BAA and to periodically check the Federal Business Opportunities and the IPTO Solicitation web page for possible new Focal Challenges and other modifications.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) in response to this Focal Challenge must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 noon (ET) Thursday, December 19, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-21 will remain open until 12:00 noon (ET) Friday, June 6, 2003.  Thus, proposals for this Focal Challenge may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA amendment through Friday, June 6, 2003. While the proposals submitted after the Thursday, December 19, 2002, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is significantly less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule for this Focal Challenge.

The evaluation factors summarized above will be used in Stage 1 to evaluate technical proposals and determine a competitive range of the most highly qualified firms that will be invited to participate in an oral presentation to take place in Chicago, IL, tentatively January 16th, 2003.  Further narrowing of the competitive range may result based on the results of the interviews.  In Stage 2, the price proposals submitted during Stage 1 will be evaluated for the firms in the competitive range.

<DESC>** UPDATE: The website is now up and running at 
http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/smsrmi/smsrmi.htm.  Please submit your questions and comments via the website. **
The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to procure selected spare parts managed by the DSCP, Defense Supply Center Columbus, and Defense Supply Center Richmond.  Under this effort, called the Strategic Material Sourcing/Rapid Manufacturing Initiative (SMS/RMI), parts will be arranged into various market baskets that group together similar items based on their shared attributes.  The federal supply groups across each DLA Inventory Control Point that may be included in the separate phases of the solicitation are 53, 39, 40, 42, 69, 41, 62, 93, and 95.  Market baskets will be comprised of a mixture of high and low demand items, and consider other industry attributes such as similar manufacturing processes and/or materials, and prospective competitive representation.  This initiative will be executed through multiple phases where each phase will consist of various market baskets. Specific information associated with each phase and its market baskets will be available at http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/ (and the link to SMS-RMI), upon issuance of the solicitation and future amendments. 

This Presolicitation Notice has been designated as a partial small business set-aside on the Fed Biz Ops for identification purposes only. This identification is to draw attention to both small and large business. Commensurate with shared attributes and competitive representation specific to each market basket, it is anticipated that respective market baskets will be identified as either a Hub Zone, 8A, Veteran Owned, Veteran Disabled, Woman Owned, Total set aside, Partial set aside or Unrestricted. Market baskets identified as unrestricted will be limited to those requirements where there is no reasonable expectation that at least two responsible small business offers will be received; as substantiated by prior experience, market research, and industry feedback. 

The resultant contract(s) terms will provide for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity types with an anticipated eleven (11) year contract term, consisting of a 5-year base period and three (3) 2-year option periods.  All parts are fully competitive and will be provided in accordance with technical requirements provided by the Government.   All items to be furnished under the resultant contract(s) will be ordered by issuance of delivery orders.    
 
The market baskets for Phase 1 will be posted on http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/ on or about 18 NOVEMBER 2002.  Prospective offerors are requested to review and provide comments on the market baskets, considering suitability for small business participation and the offeror's capability to supply the full range of items in each basket. A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is also expected to be available on the website by 22 November 2002.  Comments will be submitted via a Question and Answer link on this web site. Answers to all questions will also be available via this website.  Comments for Phase 1 must be submitted to the DSCP point of contact no later than 09 DECEMBER 2002.

Under this effort, called the Strategic Material Sourcing/Rapid Manufacturing Initiative (SMS/RMI), parts will be arranged into various market baskets that group together similar items based on their shared attributes.  The federal supply groups across each DLA Inventory Control Point that may be included in the separate phases of the solicitation are 53, 39, 40, 42, 69, 41, 62, 93, and 95.  Market baskets will be comprised of a mixture of high and low demand items, and consider other industry attributes such as similar manufacturing processes and/or materials, and prospective competitive representation.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Command (CECOM) is conducting market research to determine the interest and capability of potential sources for technical engineering and support services in providing studies, analysis, design and performance e valuations for the Firefinder weapon locating radar programs and the SHORTSTOP countermeasures system.  Firefinder consists of three systems, the AN/TPQ-36, AN/TPQ-37, and AN/TPQ-47.  These systems are mortar and artillery weapon locating radars.  SHORTSTO P is an electronic warfare system that detects proximity fuzed munitions and predetonates them.  The support required is to provide radar system performance analysis, radar hardware and software algorithm analysis, radar system threat analysis, analysis of  future radar sensor requirements, analysis and repair of Radar Environmental Simulator (RES) problems, and analysis of Firefinder and SHORTSTOP predicted performance.  To provide this type of support, the requisite technical engineering knowledge and expe rience is required.  This includes the requisite engineering tools, RES test simulation and interface requirements, and intricate knowledge of the current Firefinder radar software and hardware and historical database.  The majority of these efforts are fo r the design, development, fabrication and testing of the AN/TPQ-47 Radar Environment Simulator System (RESS).  Qualified small business sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by providing a clear and convincing S tatement of Capability.  The Statement of Capability should be detailed enough to make a technical assessment of the capabilities possessed by the Contractor.  All Statements of Capability received within 15 days of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  POC is Stan Dobies at 732-427-5224 or email address: Stanley.Dobies@iews.monmouth.army.mil.

Draft STATEMENT OF WORK

SECTION 8 FAIR MARKET RENT TELEPHONE SURVEYS

I	BACKGROUND

Fair Market Rents (FMRs) serve as the payment standard used to calculate subsidies under the Rental Voucher program.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates FMRs for about 350 metropolitan areas and 2,330 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas.

FMR Standard.--FMRs are gross rent estimates. They include the shelter rent plus the cost of all tenant-paid utilities, except telephone.  HUD sets FMRs to assure that a sufficient supply of rental housing is available to program participants. To accomplish this objective, FMRs must be both high enough to permit a selection of units and neighborhoods and low enough to serve as many low-income families as possible. The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution of standard-quality rental housing units. The current definition used is either the 40th or 50th percentile rent paid by recent movers for standard quality housing units.  The definition of "recent mover" is that used by the census - those who moved to their current residence within the past 15 months.  Public housing units, units less than 2 years old, units rented from relatives, and units where the tenant supplies more than basic maintenance services, are excluded.

Data Sources.  HUD uses the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates. Three sources of survey data are used: 

1.	Most currently available decennial Census, which provides statistically reliable rent data for use in establishing base year FMRs.

2.	American Housing Survey (AHS), which are conducted by the Bureau of Census for HUD for selected large metropolitan areas.  [and whose accuracy is comparable to that of the decennial Census.]  AHS enables HUD to develop revisions between Census years for some of the largest metropolitan areas that are surveyed on a revolving schedule of about 11 areas annually.

3.	Random digit dialing (RDD) telephone surveys, which are based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select statistically random samples of telephone numbers, dial and keep track of them, guide the interviewer through a questionnaire, and tabulate the responses to the calls.  RDD surveys are conducted for HUD by a contractor to: (a) develop 40th or 50th percentile FMR estimates for selected FMR areas; (b) develop rent estimates for subparts of FMR areas; and (c) develop the annual HUD regional gross rent change factors.  RDD regional rent change factors are developed annually for the metropolitan parts (exclusive of metropolitan areas with their own Consumer Price Index [CPI]) and nonmetropolitan parts of each of the 10 HUD regions--20 surveys in all.

Base year FMR estimates are updated and trended forward using CPI data for rents and utilities or HUD regional updating factors developed from the regional RDD surveys. CPI data are available for about 100 metropolitan FMR areas. The RDD regional factors are used to update the base year estimates for all FMR areas that do not have their own CPI survey.

	This contract effort is restricted to area-specific FMR surveys, and does not require use of the regional rent survey time-series estimation methodology.

FMR Areas.  HUD defines FMR areas as metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties. FMRs are intended to be housing market-wide rent estimates that provide housing opportunities throughout the geographic area in which rental units are in direct competition.  With a few exceptions, the most current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan areas are used because of their generally close correspondence with housing market areas.  For a small number of large metropolitan areas, some peripheral counties of OMB-defined metropolitan areas are treated as free-standing FMR areas because HUD does not consider them to be integral parts of the respective housing market areas.

II	OBJECTIVES

The objectives of this contract are to conduct up to 90 area-specific Fair Market Rent surveys per year.  Because of the volume of surveys that must be conducted simultaneously, high levels of telephone and data processing technology and staffing are critical for success.

III	SCOPE

The contractor is to conduct and analyze the area-specific Fair Market Rent survey methodology and conduct research as specified by the GTR. 

1.	Area Surveys

Under this contract, for which it is anticipated multiple awards will be necessary, up to 90 area surveys may be conducted per fiscal year: 

1	Each contractor shall be capable of completing at least 5 surveys within a two-month period.  These surveys may start the first week of January and are to be delivered by March 15th.  Up to 60 surveys may be requested during this period.  The Government Technical Representative (GTR) will specify what areas are to be surveyed by the previous December 31st.   No individual survey is to take more than six weeks to complete.  

2	Each contractor shall be capable of completing at least 5 additional surveys that must be completed by the end of the first full week in August and may be started in April.  No individual survey is to take more than six weeks to complete.  

3	Each contractor selected for this contract may also be requested to conduct and deliver results for additional surveys at any point in the year to the extent they have the capacity and are requested to do so. 

2.	Research, Evaluation, and Program Support

Under this contract HUD has the option of requesting additional survey design research for FMR estimation factors.   This may include: (1) refining the simplified methodology for estimation of FMRs in areas that are too small to merit full-scale RDDs; (2) analyzing all survey data obtained to estimate confidence intervals, medians, and other statistical properties; and (3) optimizing survey design for hard-to-survey areas.  This research is to be conducted by experts in survey design and statistics who are intimately familiar with the details of the surveys being done under this contract and any request.  These services may be provided by subcontractors which need not be identified until the need for such services, if any, is requested by HUD.


IV	DETAILED WORK REQUIREMENTS

A.	Minimum Requirements

1.	Contractors must document the proven capacity for conducting Random Digit Dialing (RDD) surveys with response rates at or above 50% without pre-contact mailings as calculated according to the American Association of Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) guidelines (see attachment, AAPOR method 3), or response rates at or above 65% with pre-contact mailings.  This is a non-negotiable OMB requirement.

2.	Because of the large volume of work, the degree of precision required, and the requirement for detailed documentation, the contractor must use fully automated telephone interviewing and data processing technology.  The questionnaire must be programmed into a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system with data validation feed-back to interviewers.  The system must also feature direct data entry and summarization and automatic telephone scheduling, dialing, sample tracking, and record-keeping.

3.	The contractor's facility must operate a minimum of 15 computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) stations, and it must be capable of completing 5 area surveys and submitting results within an 8-10 week period.  For estimation purposes, it should be assumed that an average of 100,000 phone numbers would need to be selected for 5 area surveys, that surveys should be done primarily during evening and weekend hours over a 8-10 week period, and that at least 10 attempts must be made to contact each number

4.	The contractor may expand its CATI capacity by using a subcontractor, but the subcontractor's capacity may not be substituted for the minimum contract capacity of 15 CATI stations or, in total, reduce the offer's portion of the work done to less than 50 percent of the total contract value.  



B.	General Requirements

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, postage, equipment, facilities and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incidental to, the performance of the tasks set forth in this Statement of Work.  The work to be performed under this task includes, but is not necessarily limited to: discussions with the GTR and other HUD staff on methodological issues; modification of instruments for information collection; modification of the sampling methodology for selecting phone numbers; development of interviewer protocols; training and monitoring interviewers; conducting all needed phone calls; automation of results; calculation of the 40th and 50th percentile contract and gross rents for surveyed areas; calculation of the 95th percent confidence interval for the estimates produced; quality control; and provision of reports to HUD containing the results of the surveys conducted. 

The contractor is responsible for maintaining data files under secure conditions, to be released only to the GTR. In addition, the contractor is responsible for providing off-site backups of data files.  The contractor shall make all work sites available for on-site inspection and monitoring on an as-requested basis by HUD staff or designees.

C.	Specific Requirements

In conducting this work, the Contractor shall perform the following subtasks in accordance with the objectives and general scope of the contract.

	Subtask 1:  Orientation and Work Plan

Within two weeks of the contract award date, the Contractor's project manager and key project staff shall review all information provided in this contract package and discuss the scope of this effort with HUD staff. The objective is to establish a detailed common understanding of the task order objectives, the scope of work needed to achieve these objectives, the type of information sought, procedures for contacting HUD staff, and a schedule for the performance of subtasks.  

The contractor shall submit to the GTR a work plan with a time schedule for completing the area surveys within two weeks following the discussion, and describe a time frame and process for responding to additional requests for area-specific surveys, as well as for related statistical consulting. It shall also specify a proposed means of electronically exchanging data files, such as via the Internet or an FTP site.  

	Subtask 2:
	Review Survey Design and Instruments and Recommend Modifications 

Within four weeks of contract award, the contractor shall submit to the GTR any modifications sought to the survey design or questionnaire used in either type of survey.  Any modifications must have the GTR's prior approval.  

	Subtask 3:  Conduct Area Surveys

3.1	General Background 

Attachment J-1(will be included in the solicitation) describes in detail the methodology to be used to conduct area-specific surveys, including the suggested questionnaire wording and the precision requirements. For each metropolitan area, the contractor must complete at least 200 interviews of eligible recent mover renters, thereafter increasing the sample size if necessary to produce the desired 95% confidence level that the rent estimate desired is within 5% of the true value.  In most cases, 200 responses are adequate, and it is very unusual to need more than 250. (This requirement is more stringent than that specified in Attachment J-1, as it is possible that more than 200 responses may be needed to achieve the required sample precision.) 

Under this contract, up to 90 area surveys per year will be conducted: up to 60 between January 2 and March 15, up to 60 between April and the end of the first week of August are to be conducted.  [For the first year of this contract these time schedules will not apply.]

3.2	Operational Requirements

Samples must be randomly selected from all known working 100-blocks of residential numbers.  Automated screening must be used to filter out non-working and business numbers.  Reverse address matches must be used to identify residential addresses to the extent possible, and pre-contact postcards sent using a provided HUD script to encourage survey participation.

The contractor must make at least 10 attempts to reach and interview each sample number.  These attempts must be made on different days and at different times of the day.  Extensive supervision of interviewers (i.e., one supervisor per 5-6 interviewers) is required to ensure that protocols are followed and that interviewees are treated with respect in accordance with survey protocols.  

For surveys in areas with high numbers of Spanish speakers, Spanish-speaking interviewers must be available at all times. Interviewers with other language capability must be available as needed, but need not be on duty at all times.


3.3	Schedule and Deliverables

Under this contract up to 90 area surveys per year will be conducted, with the following timing: (1) for up to 60 of these surveys, to begin in January, the contractor shall deliver the results to the GTR by the middle of March.  This requirement is premised on specification by the GTR of what areas are to be surveyed by no later than December 31st; (2) for up to an additional 60 surveys, to begin no earlier than April, the contractor shall deliver the results no later than the end of the first full week in August; (3) each contractor may also be requested to conduct and deliver results for up to 1 survey a year, of which no more than one will be requested at one time, within 4 weeks of the GTR's request. 

The contractor must calculate the fair market rent at the 40th or 50th percentile (depending on whether or not an area receives a 40th or 50th percentile rent) for all units surveyed and separately for recent movers and for stayers.  For each of these categories, rents must be calculated for 1-bedroom units, 2-bedroom units and a blended rate based on both 1- and 2-bedroom units.  The 95% estimate confidence interval for the 40th or 50th percentile rent should be calculated for the 2-bedroom blended recent mover rent (i.e., based on 1- and 2-bedroom units), the 2-bedroom only recent mover rent, and the 2-bedroom blended rent for all units surveyed (stayers and movers).

The resolution rate, residential rate, response rate, screening rate, completion rate and overall rate must be calculated for each area using AAPOR definitions.  As noted previously in the Minimum Requirements specifications, an average AAPOR (method three) response rate performance standard of 65% is required for this work.  This response rate assumes use of a pre-contact mailing.  Surveys used to demonstrate an offeror's potential to comply with this requirement must show at least a 50% AAPOR response rate if no pre-contact procedure was used.

The contractor shall provide to the GTR all information needed to reconstruct any statistics or estimate of sampling errors, including an explanation of how the sample was selected; all information for completed one and two-bedroom renter unit interviews (including telephone numbers); all calculations used to construct estimates of the 40th percentile rent estimates (2-bedroom blended recent movers, 2-bedroom recent movers, and 2-bedroom blended all renters) and their variance; and all of the response rate calculations specified in Attachment J-1. The results are to be summarized in a written communication, and the full survey data are to be sent electronically as a data file in the form requested by the GTR.  

In addition, the contractor shall submit an overall summary and recommendations report within two months of submitting the results of the January-March surveys.

3.4	Government-Furnished Materials

HUD will supply the current Section 8 utility allowance schedule, as a data file or in Microsoft EXCEL form, prior to completion of each Area survey (See Attachment J-3 for an example.)  HUD will also provide the survey instrument and the script for the pre-contact postcard mailing.  

	
	Subtask 4:  Research and Evaluation

4.1	General Background

The contractor may, at the GTR's discretion, review the Area survey methodology as currently specified in Attachments J-1 and J-2, and propose any modifications that it deems necessary.  Cost-saving measures to be taken in areas where surveys are expected to be particularly expensive to conduct should be proposed to the GTR. This is particularly true in the smaller nonmetropolitan areas, where a somewhat lower standard of precision may be acceptable to HUD.

4.2	Simplified RDD Surveys

	Small housing authorities wishing to comment on their FMRs must be able to provide usable, scientifically defensible surveys without the comparatively large expenditure of funds required by full-scale RDDs. In response to this need, HUD developed a simplified RDD survey methodology and guide explaining, in non-technical terms, how to conduct surveys that would be acceptable as FMR comments. The latest version of this guide is included as Attachment J-2. The contractor may be requested to advise HUD on ways to refine that survey methodology, if requested by the GTR.

V	INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS

A.	Varying Number of Area RDDs

The total number of individual area RDDs that HUD will fund annually may differ from year to year, subject to funding availability, as follows:  

1.	No less than ten (10) or more than sixty (60) area RDDs to be completed between January 2 and March 15, by all contractors in total.  Each area RDD is to take at most 6 consecutive weeks of interviewing time.

2.	No less than ten (10) or more than sixty (60) area RDDs are to be completed between April 1 and August 7, by all contractors in total.  Each area RDD is to take at most 6 consecutive weeks of interviewing time.

3.	Up to three (3) area RDDs to be completed by all contractors in total at any time of the year on an expedited basis (final results to be delivered within 4 weeks of the GTR's request) at any one time.


B.	Minimum Number of Area RDDs

Subject to annual funding availability, HUD anticipates never requesting fewer than 40 area surveys per year.  Not less than five (5) surveys will be assigned to a contractor at one time for either of the two normal area survey periods.

C.	Work Assignment Preferences

Surveys will be assigned based on estimated cost, capacity, and performance (i.e., lowest bidder will be given as many surveys as they can readily conduct within required timeframes.)

D.	Cost Variability

In addition to the number of surveys that will be requested annually under the contract, there will also be variability in the size of the samples required to meet the survey requirement for 200 or more completed surveys of recent mover renters of one and two bedroom units.  This variability will be compensated using a standardized formula approach that will be provided in the formal solicitation.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent agency of the U.S. Government established to promote scientific and engineering research and programs, to strengthen research potential, and to appraise the impact of research upon industrial development and the general welfare. NSF is seeking sources of supply for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software and provision of accompanying support services to automate its procurement processes, ranging from small purchases to large, complex contracts of all types. Such support services as will be required include installation, integration into the NSF financial management system, training, and software maintenance.  CURRENT WORKLOAD: NSF has approximately the following active procurements, by type: 60 contracts (including BOA's); 60 task orders; and 35 interagency agreements. Approximate annual contract actions, by type, include 980 simplified acquisitions, 360 contracts, 55 interagency agreements, and 5800 purchase card transactions. The scope of the acquisition effort includes contracts for administrative and professional services, logistical support services, facilities operation and maintenance, and IT hardware, software and services. This workload is expected to grow with anticipated increases in the NSF budget. CURRENT REQUIREMENT: The current requirement will be to support 25 contracting personnel at one site, and 200 additional personnel with requisition authority. NSF forsees no significant increase in the number of sites or users. The desired system shall permit automation of the complete procurement cycle, to include requisitioning, ordering, contract administration, and reporting to the FPDS and the NSF financial management system. Integration into the NSF financial management system shall provide for electronic preparation and transmittal of requisitions, and a real-time interface for funds certification, obligation/deobligation, payment and tracking of funds. As well as the automated development of acquisition plans by project office and contracting personnel, the system should provide for management-level reporting on all phases of the acquisition cycle. Remote access by off-site users is not required; however, the system should allow for current e-procurement functionality through the use of e-catalogs (GWAC's, GSA Advantage!), bid opportunity posting (NSF website, FedBizOpps), and bid receipt/processing, as well as provide for the use of e-signatures, allow the use of both the NIH Past Performance System and the DOD Central Contractor Registry, and demonstrate compliance with Section 508 requirements. The National Science Foundation currently operates a NT 2000 Unix system with a SYBASE 12.5.1 database. System administration requirements include: (1) a time-triggered password monitoring system to notify users of password expiration, to allow users to change passwords within the product without special system authority, to verify the change and to reset the time trigger once the changes have been made; and (2) the ability to establish/delete users and to modify their capabilities by the product functional administrator without special system or DBA authority. NSF regards ease of use as important to gaining user acceptance and reducing administrative workload. FUTURE REQUIREMENTS: NSF intends to comply with future requirements of the OFPP Integrated Acquisition Environment Initiative. As described on the ARNET E-Gov Initiatives Website (www.arnet.gov/egov), elements of the Integrated Acquisition Environment initiative include: Consolidated eCatalogs; the Business Partner Network; Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation; the Intra-government Transactions Exchange; and Standard eTransactions. CONTACT INFORMATION: Responses to this sources sought announcement shall be submitted no later than December 6, 2002 to: National Science Foundation, Division of Acquisition and Cost Support, Attn: Chris Robey, Suite 475, 4201 Wilson Blvd,  Arlington, VA, 22230. Reference: DACS-Automation. Electronic responses are both recommended and encouraged, and should be submitted to crobey@nsf.gov. If providing the information electronically, please ensure that the information is compatible and accessible using Microsoft Office 2000 software. Hard-copy descriptive materials, brochures and samples submitted in response to this announcement will not be returned. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. Information provided herein is subject to change, and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or to award a contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizops.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offeror to monitor Federal Business Opportunities for the release of any follow-on information.

<DESC>The National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is considering conducting a study to test the efficacy of an innovative program of clinic-based behavioral interventions on adherence and glycemic control in early and middle adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The purpose of this announcement is to request Capability Statements from interested small businesses in order to determine, for planning purposes, whether there are any potential responsible small businesses that have the capability to perform the study.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this study is 541720.  Therefore, the small business size status is $6 million in average annual receipts, or less, for the past three years.

Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is a relatively common childhood chronic illness, affecting approximately one child in 600 (LaPorte, Matsushima, & Chang, 1995).  The medical regimen for diabetes is complicated and interferes with everyday life, making adherence difficult and often inadequate for achieving good metabolic control (Mortensen et al., 1997).  Because the extent of lifelong adherence is associated with long-term health outcomes (DCCT, 1993), improvements in daily adherence during adolescence truly matter.  Gradually, early adolescents assume increased responsibility for their regimen at the same time parental involvement declines, but the transition of responsibility from parent to child can be problematic, leading to poor adherence and glycemic control (Allen et al, 1983; Anderson et al., 1990; Anderson et al., 1997; Wysocki et al., 1996).

The objectives of the clinic-based behavioral interventions are to (1) enhance youth motivation for adherence with the therapeutic regimen; (2) increase and improve self-regulation and self-management skills; (3) foster appropriate parenting behavior; and (4) promote effective and satisfactory sharing of responsibilities of parents and youths for the diabetic regimen; and (5) facilitate an effective partnership between the family and the health care team (e.g., physicians and diabetes educators).  The primary research question is "Does providing motivational and self-management behavioral interventions during early adolescence promote improved adherence and glycemic control?"

A sample of early adolescent youth with diabetes and a parent would be recruited to participate in the study.  Family members would provide consent to participate and would be informed about the nature of the research and the potential risks and benefits, interviewed upon recruitment, and followed for two years.  Parent-child dyads would be randomly assigned to the comparison group or the special intervention group, involving interpersonal and mediated intervention components delivered at the clinic and remotely.  Participants would complete computer-based assessments at each clinic visit and would be interviewed at baseline and annually for three years.  Outcomes would include attitudes towards diabetes management, parent and child responsibility for diabetes management tasks, parent-child conflict, level of adherence to the diabetes management regimen, and glycemic control (as measured by HbA1c).

Interested small businesses that believe they have the capabilities necessary to successfully perform this study may submit a Capability Statement to Mr. Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at the address provided by 1:00 P.M. EDT on October 25, 2002.  Please note that there is no standard form or format for such Capability Statements.  However, at a minimum your submission must clearly provide the following information concerning your organization in an organized manner:  

(1) Experience with randomized behavioral trials involving health care facilities, diabetic youth, and parents, including participant recruitment, informed consent, multiple measures collected repeatedly over time, intervention development, and implementation, and evaluation; 
(2) Established link with a health care facility that provides care to at least 150 patients ages 10-15 with type 1 diabetes;
(3) Experience recruiting and maintaining participation of health care facilities in behavioral research; 
(4) Experience training and supervising research staff;
(5) Experience with computer-based survey administration;  
(6) Experience developing and conducting behavioral interventions for health promotion with early and middle adolescent youth;
(7) Demonstration of financial responsibility and adequate financial resources to perform a contract for this study.

Please be advised there is NO solicitation or Request for Proposal(s) associated with this announcement, therefore, contract proposals will not be considered at this time.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.

The Versatile Information System  Integrated, ONline (VISION) is a Developmental Test Command initiative to  develop and field the next generation information acquisition and information management capability. VISION employs a web-based approach that merges instrumentation and information management technologies, and makes use of modern communications technology .  A major goal of the VISION initiative is to establish open instrumentation hardware and software architectures to achieve interoperability among various major test and training instrumentation subsystems.  VISION embodies efforts to implement engineerin g performance (or DT) instrumentation as networked internet appliances, and to provide wireless/mobile internet connectivity at the test item level.  By implementing a network centric architecture based on established standards seamless information flow fr om instrumentation all the way to enterprise information management resources can be assured. VISION is concerned with more that data collection, and includes provision for the ultimate fate of data, its use in the synthesis of information and knowledge, h ow it is archived, and how it is used in modeling and simulation.

<CONTACT>RICHARD P. BOLICK, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, 703-787-1395, RICHARD.BOLICK@MMS.GOV
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2002-09. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-03-RP-70088 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  BACKGROUND: In 1998 and 1999 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), established several pilot programs to evaluate crop yield and cost-incurrence coverage for limited resource farmers of certain food crops, among them cultivated wild rice, sweet potatoes, cherries and winter squash.  The USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) is seeking program evaluations for four of these pilot programs, to be used to determine whether the programs should be continued as pilot programs, modified, terminated, or converted to permanent programs.  This solicitation consists of four line items. Prospective Offerors may propose on more than one line item, but each line item must be proposed separately.  ITEM 1. Cultivated Wild Rice Pilot Evaluation. This project is for a program evaluation that includes a Feedback and Issues Report, a Rating and Pricing Report, and a Final Evaluation Report.  The evaluation will be used to determine if the program should be continued as a pilot, modified, terminated, or converted to a permanent program. The Board of Directors of the FCIC approved the pilot program effective for the 1999 crop year.  The Cultivated Wild Rice program is a yield guarantee program that is based on the actual production history (APH) of the insured.  The program provides coverage against damage due to adverse weather conditions, fire, insects, wildlife, earthquake, volcanic eruption, failure of irrigation water supply, and plant disease.  ITEM 2.  Cherry Pilot Evaluation. This project is for a program evaluation that includes hard copy reports and oral presentations on the results of a comprehensive review of the cherry pilot program.  The evaluation will be used to determine if the program should be continued as a pilot, modified, terminated, or converted to a permanent program. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's Board of Directors approved the pilot program on August 11, 1998 for selected counties in California, Montana, Oregon and Washington effective for the 1999 crop year.  The program was approved for expansion on July 27, 1999 to include new counties in Michigan and Utah.  To further expand the pilot, the program was approved for expansion into additional counties in California, Oregon and Washington effective for the 2000 crop year.  RMA has received grower requests for program expansion into San Benito and Santa Clara Counties, California. ITEM 3.  Sweet Potato Pilot Evaluation. This project is for a program evaluation that includes hard copy reports and oral presentations on the results of a comprehensive review of the Sweet potato pilot program.  The first phase of the evaluation was to collect information from sweet potato producers and others interested in the pilot program.  This phase of the evaluation was completed under a separate contract and the information is provided in a Feedback and Issues Report.  Issues identified in the Feedback and Issues Report should be considered in the completion of this project. The evaluation will be used to determine if the program should be continued as a pilot, modified, terminated, or converted to a permanent program. FCIC's Board of Directors approved the pilot program effective for the 1998 crop year for selected counties in Alabama, California, Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina.  The sweet potato program is an APH plan that uses producers' actual records of planted acres, production, and harvest of sweet potatoes grading California Number 1, California Medium, California Jumbo in California, and Jumbo, United States Extra Number 1, Commercial and Number 2 in all other states.  These aforementioned grades are used to establish the insurance guarantee.  The program provides coverage against damage due to adverse weather, fire, insects, wildlife, earthquake, volcanic eruption, failure of irrigation water supply, and plant disease.  ITEM 4. Winter Squash Pilot Evaluation. This project is for a program evaluation that includes hard copy reports and oral presentations on the results of a comprehensive review of the winter squash pilot program.  The evaluation will be used to determine if the program should be continued as a pilot, modified, terminated, or converted to a permanent program. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's Board of Directors approved the pilot program for the 1999 crop year for winter types of squash in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York and expanded the program to pumpkins in New York and Pennsylvania for the 2000 crop year.  The winter squash program is a dollar amount of insurance plan based on average pre-harvest costs per acre that producers can expect to incur during the growing season.  The program provides protection against damage due to adverse weather, fire, insects, wildlife, earthquake, volcanic eruption, failure of irrigation water supply and plant disease. OBJECTIVE. The primary objective of these requirements is to secure the services of technical experts who will provide RMA with the necessary information and resources to determine if the pilot programs should be continued as pilots, modified, terminated, or converted to permanent programs.  SCOPE OF WORK.  For each Line Item except Number 3 - Sweet Potato Pilot Evaluation, the contractor(s) shall perform the following tasks that are described in greater detail in the SOW Documents, and meet the standards for successful accomplishment: (A) Conduct listening sessions; (B) Compile and analyze results of the listening sessions into interim Feedback and Issues Reports on a state basis; (C) Produce a final Feedback and Issues Report for review by RMA subject matter experts that compiles and summarizes the results of the interim state reports;  (D) Provide a Rating and Pricing Evaluation Report that evaluates the rating and pricing of the programs;  (E) Provide a Final Evaluation Report that evaluates the program and provides recommendations on its future status. (Tasks A, B and C have already been accomplished for the Sweet Potato Pilot Evaluation through an earlier contract.  The Final Feedback and Issues Report from that contract shall be made available on request to prospective Offerors for this Line Item.) Offeror(s) shall include quality control standards for the successful accomplishment of the tasks, a method to monitor and report task progress, corrective actions to be taken to meet deliverable dates if tasks are off schedule, and a quality control matrix of the productive hours for each skill type that will be devoted to quality control on each.
