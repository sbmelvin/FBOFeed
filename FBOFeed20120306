<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this inquiry is to determine your interest and qualifications as a possible Offeror to perform tank construction for Saltstone Disposal Unit (SDU) 6. It is anticipated the Procurement Specification will request subcontractor(s) to build a 32 million gallon concrete tank to act as a low level radioactive solid waste disposal unit. This potential construction subcontract will be performed with labor whose wages are subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.</p>
<p><br />The mission of the Saltstone Facility at SRS is to process and dispose of low level radioactive salt solution from the liquid waste processing facilities. The Saltstone Facility immobilizes low level radioactive salt solution waste by mixing it with a dry material mixture of fly ash, slag, and cement to produce a flowable grout mixture. This grout is poured into large concrete disposal units where it cures to become Saltstone, a non-hazardous material, for permanent disposal. Expected construction duration is sixteen (16) months from start to Mechanical Completion on a 4 X 10 work week.</p>
<p>A Disposal Unit is expected to have the following attributes:<br />- AWWA D110 Type 1 pre-stressed concrete tank<br />- Class 3 Concrete (Type V cement)<br />- 375 ft diameter<br />- 43 ft high<br />- Refer to attached sketch (Attachment #3)<br />- No wall or floor penetrations<br />- Approximately 300 roof penetrations<br />- 100% leak tight (zero leakage)<br />- Below slab Leak detection system</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; DLA Distribution (DLA J7-AB) has a requirement for Maintenance renewal on Micro focus Enterprise Server, MFEEE. The period of performance is from 26 April 2012 through 25 April 2013. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512; the Business Size Standard is $25,000,000<br /><br />Micro Focus Mainframe Migration Server, Studio Enterprise Edition Support, and MFEEE are software that is used for the development of the DSS web front end. This is required to keep up with the constant upgrades and new development in this software in order to continue the development of the DSS mainframe and mid-tier system. Micro Focus is the only source that can provide service/support due to the proprietary nature of the systems and software which were developed by them for the DSS operating system. The software in use has been declared proprietary; no other vendor could meet objectives, without gaining access to the "source listing code".<br />Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this support, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government. Interested contractors may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Interested sources may respond by submitting their company's qualifications/capabilities by 23 March 2012, 11:00 AM EST to Contract Specialist Paul Holbert via email paul.holbert@dla.mil. Phone call requests will not be accepted.<br />

<a href="mailto:Garger.Jennifer@epa.gov">garger.jennifer@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Headquarters Procurement Operations Division (HPOD), will issue a solicitation for Pollution Prevention (P2) Support Services for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP).  The solicitation will be a follow-on contract for services that are currently provided by the incumbent, Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG), under EPA contract EPW07017.  The source sought notification for this procurement was released on November 28, 2011 through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov).The broad mission of EPA?s P2 Program (http://www.epa.gov/p2) is to prevent pollution at the source, promote the use of greener substances, and conserve natural resources, which are critical steps towards achieving a sustainable society.  The program?s authority comes primarily from the 1990, Pollution Prevention Act (PPA).   However, many components of the P2 Program use dual authority from the PPA and the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In addition, a series of Executive Orders, since 1993, focus on the identification and acquisition of environmentally preferable products and services for federal agencies. In 2010, the Agency finalized the P2 Program Strategic Plan 2010-2014 (EPA P2 Program Strategic Plan 2010 ) to help guide the P2 Program as it works to achieve its mission over the next five years.  The goals of that plan are as follows:Goal 1: Reduce the generation of greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change.Goal 2: Reduce the manufacture and use of hazardous materials to improve human and ecological health.Goal 3: Reduce the use of water and conserve other natural resources to protect ecosystems.Goal 4: Create business efficiencies that derive economic benefits and improve environmental performance.Goal 5: Institutionalize and integrate pollution prevention practices through government services, policies, and initiatives.
The contractor receiving award shall furnish the necessary personnel, supplies, equipment, services and facilities to perform the tasks in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The PWS consists of five (5) broad tasks which contribute to the goals of the Strategic Plan identified above.  These tasks are:  (1) Facilitate P2 adoption through technical assistance to industry, (2) Use Federal procurement to encourage source reduction, (3) Promote the integration of P2 throughout EPA?s work, (4) Develop State and Tribal P2 capacity and (5) Establish standard methods of measuring P2 results.
Solicitation SOL-DC-11-00008 for Pollution Prevention Support Services will be a 100% Small Business Set - Aside and will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded in accordance with the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.  The EPA anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Time and Materials (T&M) contract from this solicitation.  The contract?s period of performance shall be for a one-year base period with four one-year option periods for a maximum contract performance period of five (5) years.
This is a 100% small business set-aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 for Environmental Consulting Services with the applicable size standard of $7 million in annual receipts (or income) as defined under 13 CFR ? 121.104. 
It is estimated that the solicitation will be available on or about March 12, 2012 with a due date of 30 days after release of the solicitation.
Detailed information for this requirement is provided through the Performance Work Statement (PWS and other associated documents which will be posted on the EPA?s website at the following address:

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Standards and Risk Management Division (SRMD), Technical Support Center (TSC) requires contract laboratory support for analytical microbiology services in conjunction with the implementation of the third cycle of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR 3). UCMR 3 was proposed March 3, 2011 and is expected to be promulgated as a final regulatory action in early 2012.  For additional information on UCMR 3, please see the following site- http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/ucmr/ucmr3.
The EPA is seeking contractor laboratories to conduct the analysis of water samples using all of the following methods: (1) EPA Method 1615v1.1; (2) SM9223/Colilert; (3) Enterolert/ASTM D6503-99; (4) EPA Method 1602; and (5) SM 9218.  Any laboratory interested in these microbial contaminant analytical services will first be evaluated for capability based on the technical evaluation criteria.  Those laboratories that are deemed acceptable must then participate in a performance testing (PT) study for Method 1615v1.1.  Only laboratories that meet PT criteria will be considered for contract award.  The PT study for EPA Method 1615v1.1 is expected to begin in June 2012.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from electric generation suppliers to provide electric power supply to Federal accounts in Maryland, Delaware and possibly other PJM areas.&nbsp; Most of the electric requirement is behind the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE).&nbsp; The Government has divided its electric requirement into three (3) pricing groups.&nbsp; One group will be an indexed priced group with the potential for block purchases and there are two (2) fixed price pricing groups.&nbsp; The index group will have a term of five (5) years and the fixed price group will have a term of thirty-six (36) months.&nbsp; The successful offeror will supply all electricity components for the respective pricing groups.&nbsp; The successful offeror will be required to purchase the SRECs produced from a 1.116 MW solar array located at a site included in the indexed priced group (see solicitation for details).&nbsp; Deliveries will begin with the June 2012 meter read date for all accounts unless otherwise specified. A six (6) month extension period is included in the contract. The approximate total annual electric requirement is 188,000 MWhs for the index group and approximately 70,000 MWhs for the fixed price groups.&nbsp; The price offered will apply to all accounts in the solicitation and that price will remain fixed for the contract term.&nbsp; Capacity and transmission will be treated as pass-through pricing items.&nbsp; This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.&nbsp; The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR. This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice and the synopsis. The Government intends to award a contract to the offeror that offers the lowest evaluated price and meets the solicitation's technical requirements. Supplier technical responses to the solicitation are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on March 27, 2012 via email to the Contracting Officer (see solicitation instructions).&nbsp; Pricing will be submitted in accordance with the solicitation on April 3, 2012 via email to the contracting officer (see solicitation instructions).&nbsp; Contact Mr. Ken Shutika on (202) 260-9713 (ken.shutika@gsa.gov) if you have any questions.&nbsp; Suppliers interested in obtaining authorization to pull account data from the local utility should contact Mr. Shutika.

<DESC>NASA/SSC has a requirement for the extension of Facility Operating Services (FOS)to the Area 9 Complex, on site at Stennis Space Center (SSC), MS, formerly known asMississippi Army Ammunition Plant (MSAAP). FOS anticipated scope of work for Area 9includes:  1.) Management, labor, facilities, materials, and equipment necessary toprovide facility operating services for: engineering services; institutional services;facilities maintenance and operations; safety and mission assurance; environmentalservices; occupational health; logistics and maintenance; and administrative services.This includes a full range of management duties, including project management,configuration management, planning, scheduling, work control, report preparation, safetyand quality control; and 2.) Resolution of unusual and emergency situations, such as:hurricane preparation and recovery support; fire fighting support from constructionactivities; and recovery from tornadoes, any one of which may occur from time to timethroughout the period of performance. NASA/SSC intends to award the facility operating services on a sole source basis inaccordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies orServices Will Satisfy Agency Requirements," to SSC FOS Contract (NNS07AB21C) with JacobsTechnology, Inc.

Jacobs Technology, Inc. is presently providing all required facility operating servicesfor NASA SSC and all of NASA's tenants under contract # NNS07AB21C; this contract wasawarded from a full and open competition in 2007. NASA has a need to secure a permanentFOS contractor for Area 9 to provide uninterrupted services to the existing operations.It has been determined to be in the best interest of the government to modify NASA SSC'sexisting FOS contract with Jacobs Technology, Inc. for these services to this area forthe remainder of the contract. NASA awarded these services previously via modification#277 to JTI on June 1, 2011 as a bridge in order to determine if future competition forthis requirement would be feasible.

Re:	VISN 18 Vendor Fair/Demonstration

Dear Vendor Representatives:
VA Southwest Health Care Network (VISN 18) is inviting prospective vendors who can provide 
point of care work stations to a meeting at the Tucson VA Health Care on April 4, 2012.

Meeting objectives for VISN 18 participants are to understand and become familiar with commercial off-the-shelf clinical information system point of care hardware products and to conduct market research to understand clinical features and functions commonly available in modern commercial offerings. Attendees will identify functional requirements for VISN 18 systems. Your participation will help educate our staff about modern systems so that we may refine our system requirements, including but not limited to the following items:
Point of care workstations
Mini pc
Touch screen displays
Mouse/track ball/track pad option
Keyboard skins
Mounting hardware solutions and Roll-around carts
Please Note: We consider this meeting to be "market research." We are not "evaluating" your products against other vendors' products. Rather, we seek to identify important features and functions to VISN 18 that are commonly available in commercial product offerings. You should neither consider your company as favored in any fashion by VISN 18, nor should you consider VISN 18 under any obligation to your company as a result of your participation in this meeting. VISN 18 intends to formally solicit proposals from multiple sources within the next several months from some or all vendors participating in this meeting as well as other vendors. 
While interacting with VA staff, you may find it beneficial to know their role (physician, nurse, ICU or anesthesia, Biomedical Engineering, IT, etc). However, you should have no need to capture and retain names of VA personnel. Should VA personnel request additional or follow up information, please refer them to VISN Project Leadership and/or furnish the information via Carlos Leon, VISN 18 Contracting Officer. Mr. Leon will then share the information with VA staff as appropriate.  
Logistical Information
The Conference Rooms will be available to begin setting up at 7:30 AM on April 4, 2012. The meeting will run until 4 PM. 
We ask that your representatives wear name badges identifying name and company at all times.   

You may hand out brochures and other literature. Any electronic files should be given to Jane Mitchell for distribution to VISN 18 staff. 
The audience for these presentations will include Nurses, Physicians, Anesthesiologists, CNRAs, Clinical Applications Coordinators, Biomedical Engineering, IT, Contracting, Administrators, and other stakeholders. 
Please be prepared to present on the topics below, as appropriate:
"	High level executive summary of your product offerings 
"	Product overviews, including clinical champion using system (25 minutes or less)  
"	Product overviews (25 minutes or less)
"	Hands-on demonstrations of products
"	Technical discussion including an overview of system architecture (hardware, operating system, database, application), medical device interfacing, network requirements (LAN, Wireless, WAN), and VistA interfaces (30 minutes)

  
Your VA contacts for all questions are:

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Robert J. Dole Medical Center (Wichita, KS) intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the Wichita, KS metropolitan area to provide services as part of the VA's Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />FOR<br />Flotation Equipment Deployment System (FEDS)<br />Retractor Pressure Cartridge<br />Shielded Mild Detonating Cord (SMDC) Line Ship Sets
<p>C-17 Cargo Aircraft</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, OO-ALC/GHGKB</p>
<p>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION<br />This is a Source Sought Synopsis announcement, market research for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. This market research is being conducted to identify potential sources possessing the engineering and manufacturing knowledge for the FEDS, Retractor Pressure Cartridge, and SMDC Line Ship Sets. The FEDS consist of two forward and two aft panel assemblies used on the C-17 Aircraft. The panel assemblies consist of linear charge assemblies (LCA) and are functioned when an explosive signal is transferred from any one of the aircraft arm/fire initiators to the panel assembly via Shielded Mild Detonating Cord (SMDC). The LCA's detonate, producing a jet penetration cutting action of the aircraft skin/longerons providing hatches for life raft deployment and aircrew escape. The retractor pressure cartridge consists of a cylindrical housing containing gas-producing propellant.

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the lease ofABAQUS Commercial Finite Element Software. ABAQUS is a two-part finite element solver, ABAQUS /Standard and ABAQUS /Explicit, plus apre/post-processing program, ABAQUS /CAE, in the same package. ABAQUS /Standard is animplicit solver that can handle structural, thermal, and static & dynamic nonlinearproblems and offers unique capabilities not found in comparable solvers. Among them:-	User-programmable features. For example, definition of special-purpose materialconstitutive relations, elements, or contact behavior using FORTRAN subroutines, which isabsent in most competing finite element solvers. ABAQUS was the first code to offer hooksto its internal code with sub-programs written in commonly used programming languages. -	Advanced contact algorithms using slave/master surfaces and automatic contactdetection-	Model updating during an analysis using element removal/addition or contactsurface pair removal/addition. -	Inclusive set of constitutive models for materials such as elastomeric andcrushable foams, poro-elasticity, deformation plasticity, creep, viscoelasticity, etc.-	Direct use of raw test data to fit various constitutive models for creep,viscoelasticity, and hyperelastic material behavior. ABAQUS /Explicit is a special-purpose solver for high-speed and transient contact/impactproblems, such as ballistic impact and shock loading. The explicit feature for timeintegration eases the convergence of highly nonlinear solutions and discontinuousproblems that are impossible to handle with implicit solvers.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) isseeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, SmallDisadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service DisabledVeteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) forthe purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small businesssubcontracting goals for the lease of ABAQUS Commercial Finite Element Software.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a cryogen-free microscopy cryostat system. This system will be used in optical spectroscopy of semiconductor nanophotonic devices, in which a custom optical fiber waveguide probe will be used to perform near-field characterization of cryogenically-cooled samples. The system will be used to support scientific and technical research projects at the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST).
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a cryogen-free microscopy cryostat system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br />NIST has a need for a cryogen-free microscopy cryostat system that would meet the following requirements:<br />1. CRYOGEN-FREE: System must be a closed-cycle, cryogen-free cryostat using a variable flow helium compressor or equivalent cooling approach. <br />2. INTERIOR SAMPLE CHAMBER: The interior sample chamber (cold space) must have a diameter of at least 100 mm and a height of at least 62 mm.<br />3. CRYOGENIC STAGE INTEGRATION: System must come equipped with several low temperature compatible motorized stages required for fiber probing measurements. Stage requirements include: <br />1) Two attocube systems model ANPx101/LT/RES coarse positioners (or equivalent), each providing a minimum of 4 mm of linear (in-plane) translation, a minimum open-loop step size of less than 15 nm, and a closed-loop sensor resolution less than 250 nm, all at 4.2 K. The stage must be less than or equal to 25 mm x 25 mm x 12 mm in size.<br />2) One attocube systems model ANPz101/LT/RES coarse positioner (or equivalent), providing a minimum of 4 mm of linear (out-of-plane) translation, a minimum open-loop step size of less than 15 nm, and a closed-loop sensor resolution less than 250 nm, all at 4.2 K. The stage must be less than or equal to 25 mm x 25 mm x 25 mm in size.<br />3) One attocube systems model ANGt101/LT/RES goniometer (or equivalent), providing a tilt of at least 6o, a minimum step size less than 0.1 m0, and a sensor resolution of 0.02 mo, all at 4.2 K.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a residual gas analyzer (RGA) for an atomic layer deposition tool (ALD).
<p>The CNST NanoFab is a state-of-the-art nanofabrication laboratory which utilizes an atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool for conformal thin film coating on high aspect nano-structures or inside nano-porous materials. ALD is a chemical precursor reaction based self-limiting coating process. To control and explore chemical reactions in plasma and thermal ALD processes, an in-situ monitor to "watch" the precursor, water and other chemicals during the process is necessary.</p>
<p>The CNST NanoFab has a need for a residual gas analyzer (RGA), which is a small mass spectrometer designed for process control and chemical contamination monitoring in vacuum systems, that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. The RGA will be used for ALD process monitoring, so it must be able to monitor the delivery of ALD precursors/chemicals into the vacuum chamber and detect the surface chemical reaction during the ALD process.</p>
<p>2. The RGA must be able to detect minute traces of chemicals in the low-pressure gas environment. Minimum detectable concentration should be sub-ppm and minimum detectable partial pressure should be 2e-11 or lower.</p>
<p>3. The RGA detection pressure range must match ALD process pressure range which is from 1 mT to several Torr.</p>
<p>4. The RGA will be used on an existing Oxford Instruments ALD system, so it must offer a special adaptor for mounting on our ALD inlet. Special protection design for avoiding precursor condensation must be available. <br />5. The RGA must include a back-out heat jacket, turbo-molecular pump, control computer and software.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a residual gas analyzer that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socioeconomic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture such residual gas analyzers are requested to email product literature describing their capabilities to eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.  A decision will be made whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside for Small Business, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8a, SBA certified HUBZone, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, or whether to issue as full and open competition (unrestricted).
  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is seeking Small Business, SBA certified 8a, SBA certified HUBZone, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business sources with current and relevant experience, personnel, and capability to self-perform a multiple award construction contract for new construction, repair, and renovation of airfield and heavy duty paving projects.
  The term self-perform refers to performing relevant major trade work in-house without subcontractors.  This does not include administrative or management functions.  Relevant major trade work is that which is the same or similar to the work that may be ordered under the proposed contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237310 (Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction) with a Small Business Size Standard of $33.5 million.  Task orders issued under the proposed multiple award contract(s) will be performed at various federal sites within the area of responsibility (AOR) of NAVFAC Southwest including, but not limited to, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.

As a result, this transition will result in permanently closing six of the Census Bureau's twelve Regional Offices with a reduction of the national field workforce of approximately 115 to 130 positions.

The contractor will also provide job-training services to assist with resume building, interview coaching, financial planning, career counseling and other services as needed.</p>
<p>Companies interested in this project shall submit a capability statement that addresses the following needs:<br /> <br />&bull;	Provide a customized outplacement program to suit the needs of the affected employees.<br />&bull;	Implement a tracking system to monitor and track interviews and job placement activity of the affected employees.<br />&bull;	Prepare affected employees for all phases of the hiring process including resume building, interview techniques, job search and strategies, and job placement.<br />&bull;	Analyze employee attributes such as skill level and experience to ensure a higher level of satisfaction with position assignments, or job leads.<br />&bull;	The contractor must have offices in close proximity to each of the regional offices and are able to duplicate the services in each area.<br />NOTE:  The Census Bureau will not issue a contract for the described services through this announcement.  All respondents shall have financial resources to provide these services in-house.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award sole source procurement to Navigant Consulting, Inc.   Reclamation requires a contractor to measure U. S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) business practices, processes, and cost performance relative to the operations and maintenance of hydroelectric generation, pump/generation, and large pumping plants, and compare their performance with other companies/agencies that own, operate, and maintain similar facilities. The contractor shall provide the required economic benchmarking for four Reclamation regions:  Lower Colorado, Upper Colorado, Mid-Pacific, and Grand Prairie. Reclamation facilities including Hoover, Davis, Parker, Shasta, Folsom, and Tracy Pumping Plant have participated in the Navigant hydro benchmarking program since 2000.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Reclamation currently manage 31 hydroelectric facilities in the Federal Columbia River Power System including Grand Coulee, Hungry Horse, Palisades, Minidoka, Anderson Ranch, Black Canyon, Boise Diversion, Roza, Chandler, and Green Springs, all of which, utilize Navigant Consulting, Inc.'s benchmarking program.  Reclamation wide participation (pending requirement) in Navigant performance benchmarking will allow Reclamation to gain direct comparisons of power plants in each of eight key business functions that comprise the hydro generation business.  As of 2012, Navigant has acquired 80% of all hydropower data (state, federal, and private sector) in its database for bench mark economic analysis purposes. Consideration of another source would not enable any state or federal agency to adequately analyze its hydropower operations on an industry wide basis.  The estimated period of performance will consist of a 12 month base period, and four, twelve month option periods.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the scope of agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide similar requirements must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541990 which is $7 Million.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-272-9805<br />Name:		Envelope, Transparent, Large, 10" x 13"<br />Description:	Clear front and back flexible protector bound on 3 sides with sewn black plastic edging; 1/4" metal eyelet on unsewn side for hanging - 10" x 13"; 100 per box. UoI is HD. HD = box of 100 envelopes.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agencywill the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-272-9805<br />Similar Items:	ANG-1575, ANG-1572, CLI-46912, CLI-46114, CLI-45912, CLI-80912,<br />AVE-75009, WLJ-21441, ESS-64109, ESS-64209</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 20, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

Vendor:WATER RECOVERY SERVICES INC2915 S Glenrose RoadSpokane, WA 99223
The Entiat National Fish Hatchery requires the rehabilitation of groundwater production Wells #1 and #5.  Periodic rehabilitation and maintenance of these wells is vital towards maximizing well efficiency and the use of our water rights in an effort to fulfill mitigation responsibilities.  Pathogen-free groundwater is utilized year round at this facility and is maximized for a nine-month period during peak production times.  
Water Recovery Services employs a patented Aqua Freed process utilizing gaseous and liquid carbon dioxide in well rehabilitation resulting in the detachment, dissolution, and removal of sediments and encrustation from the surfaces within the well screen and the surrounding aquifer.  Various other techniques and vendors have been used at the Entiat National Fish Hatchery with poor results.  The Aqua Freed process is a proven, trusted, and cost-effective method of rehabilitating and maintaining groundwater wells at this facility.

EPA requests demonstration of capability by interested vendors through submittal of a capability statement.DisclaimerThis is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought announcement only. Responses to the SSA shall not constitute responses to a solicitation. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this SSA are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely at the Government's discretion. This SSA is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments.

Draft Statement of Work (SOW):Vehicle Insurance CoverageFor theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)During Emergency Response and Exercises in CanadaSTATEMENT OF WORKPURPOSEThe Government of Canada requires proof of insurance when U.S. Government vehicles are driven into Canada to attend planning meetings, participate in exercises, or respond to actual releases on the border (usually in a waterway/river). This insurance shall cover the vehicles and any potential liabilities that may emerge from the operation of U.S. Government vehicles while on Canadian soil.BACKGROUNDThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for responding to environmental emergencies, including releases of oil and hazardous substances due to accidents, natural disaster, acts of terrorism, and other causes. EPA has agreements with agencies in Canada to support each other during incidents that may occur along shared international borders. These agreements call for EPA personnel and equipment to enter into Canada to respond to environmental emergencies. EPA also works with Canadian counterparts to perform joint exercises of contingency plans and to discuss preparedness and response issues. These planning and preparedness activities also necessitate cross-border travel of EPA personnel and equipment. At this time, EPA is requiring insurance coverage for vehicles that will travel into Canadian territory.TASK DESCRIPTION1. A U.S. Insurance Services Office?s Business Auto Policy (ISO BAP) shall provide third party automobile liability insurance coverage for U.S. Federal government EPA vehicles traveling in Canada.a. the maximum duration of each trip would depend on the circumstances, ranging from a few days for planning meetings to weeks or months for environmental emergency responses;b. the limit of liability per occurrence shall be $1,000.000 with accidents benefits per statutory requirements;c. the ISO BAP shall include a ?Permission to Rent of Lease Endorsement? and a ?Blanket Basis Fleet Endorsement?;d. the anticipated period of performance for the ISO BAP shall be annually with the possibility of four (4) Option Periods (based on EPA?s fiscal year which begins 10/01/yr and ends 09/30/yr) with the first year being pro-rated from the date of acceptance.Potential Border Crossing Locations from the United States into Canada; Canada into the United States1.

Seattle/Port Angeles, Washington Victoria/Vancouver, British Columbia**Note: The aforementioned listings are the most likely identified crossing locations by EPA however, EPA is not limited to these crossing locations.EPA anticipates the need for up to 18 vehicles from our border regional offices to cross into Canada (25 kilometers inland) on an annual basis, with five or fewer vehicles in Canada at any one time. Some of these vehicles, which may include SUVs, 4-door sedans, pick-up trucks and recreational vehicles (RVs) serving as mobile command posts and laboratory units, could include specialized equipment. The average value of the EPA response vehicles varies from $25,000 up to $500,000 (as some contain specialized response equipment) (see attachment for more detailed information per each vehicle: Ie: VIN Number, estimated value of each vehicles, type/model of vehicle) All government issued vehicles shall have government license plates and no vehicle will be used for towing any other vehicles, equipment and/or materials. All EPA vehicles are currently covered by the Federal Government?s self- insurance clause within the United States.Depending on the nature of the border crossing (exercises or response to incidents), different employees may drive these vehicles. No driver shall be under the age of twenty-one (21). All drivers shall be certified through EPA?s Motor Vehicle Safety Program which provides safety provisions for all emergency responders. Each emergency responder must successfully complete each driving element of EPA?s Motor Vehicle Safety Program to be a certified safety driver.

In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Emergency Management intends to award a Sole Source Fixed-Price purchase order to Radiation Solutions, Inc.  This justification represents rationale for other than full and open competition for the subject procurement.  Under section 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other will satisfy the Agency's requirements for this item.
Radiation Solutions, Inc. is a designer and manufacturer of  advanced gamma-ray spectrometer instrumentation for Airborne, Mobile and Handheld radiation measurements.  RSI's detection technology incorporates a fully digital system design, spectral analysis and advanced data processing.  This technology provides a level of radiation dectection previously only attainable in laboratory equipment.
The ASPECT program is upgrading its airborne processing capabilities to automatically correct for radon interference to enhance airborne radiological environmental surveys.  The upward-looking detectors are additions to the existing detector infrastructure and can only be used with this equipment; therefore, this service permits a seamless continuity of operations for the government.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.

The purpose of this survey is to determine the availability, capability and interest of Small-Businesses, SBA (8a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) and HUBZone Small Business concerns. The work consists of a fixed price contract for furnishing all plant, labor, materials and equipment, and constructing three (3) new dikes at Yucatan in Tensas Parish LA.  Principal features of the work include mobilization and demobilization, furnishing and placing approximately 486,000 tons  Graded Stone "A" and approximately 18,000 tons  Graded Stone "C", clearing, grubbing, snagging, and excavation and environmental protection. The contractor shall begin performance within 10 calendar days and complete it within 150 calendar days after receiving the notice to proceed. This work will be performed in the Mississippi River and varying water depths and currents may be encountered.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Technical, Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirements as stated in the purchase description; 2. Past Performance, Expectation the Government has that the offeror will be able to successfully complete the required effort; and 3. Price. Award will be made to the responsible technically acceptable offeror who conforms to all of the solicitation requirements, has the lowest total evaluated price, and has affirmatively demonstrated responsibility through past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. All offeror's shall provide with their quotation, descriptive literature, brochures, and technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit. Award will be based on technical acceptability (acceptable or not acceptable), past performance (confidence or no confidence), and price. Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this request for quote. The technical proposal response shall include a written line-by-line response to each paragraph number of the purchase description. A simple statement of compliance is not acceptable. Where the technical literature demonstrates that the proposed unit meets the requirement of a specific purchase description paragraph you may reference that page and paragraph of the technical literature in your technical response in lieu of restating it. Past performance will be evaluated based on information submitted (3 recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items) in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and information obtained from the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), including information linked to FAPIIS such as from the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The Government reserves the right to use performance information from other sources such as Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), Fee Determining Officials, or commercial sources. Offerors shall be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to respond to the information. The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:<br />(1) The evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 1 EACH),<br />(2) For the option units where there is a quantity range, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity in that range.<br />(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.<br />(4) Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise such options.<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with Alternate I.

<DESC><p>(Please see section C for complete details of the requirements)<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide all supplies and/or perform the services described in Section C., Statement of Work), at the Library of Congress, in accordance with the requirements of this Solicitation/Contract. The purpose of this solicitation is to create a Blanket Purchase Agreement; this solicitation may result in multiples awards.<br /><br />CALM Division is responsible for purchasing and making available metal theft detectors known as security targets (or security strips). These security targets are used to protect many of the Library of Congress' collections, including both book and non-book formats from the unauthorized removal from Library facilities both on and off Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>To protect the many thousands of new items added to the collections, as well as material already in the collections that have not yet been protected, the Library requires approximately 500,000 security targets.</p>
<p>Materials come into the Library through Copyright and through the LOC Acquisitions Directorate. The material is housed in at least five different facilities including three Library of Congress Capitol Hill buildings, the Jefferson, Adams and Madison buildings. The public, through several reading rooms located in the Capitol Hill buildings, has materials retrieved from the collections for research and use. The main campus of the Library has three buildings, with 9-14 doors used at any time for staff and the public to enter and exit. The width of these aisles varies from thirty-six (36) to forty-eight (48) inches. Each of these doors has a Knogo theft detection aisle appropriate to that location, which is a micro-magnetic system designed to signal in the presence of a permanently active electromagnetic security strip (also commercially called tags or targets.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to annual operations for newly acquired items, as well as items already in the Capitol Hill collections, since Spring 2010 the Library has been moving millions of items of special format collection to a state-of-the-art off-site collections storage facility at Fort Meade, MD. These collections are comprised of books format and special format items, such as prints, photographs, drawings, manuscripts, music sheet, globes, negatives, microfilm masters and other 3-dimensional materials. Collections are housed in over 230,000 containers. Security targets will serve to protect containers and items during the various processes of the move and storage of those collections at Fort Meade, as well as during access of these items to patrons on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CALM Division intends to purchase the following products:</p>
<p>- Insertion between pages (double-sided adhesive - 5") security targets</p>
<p>- Book spine insertion (single-sided adhesive - 4") security targets</p>
<p>- Metal rods (for insertion of targets inside books)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These materials need to meet LC Specifications provided in this solicitation for preservation and security of collection in order to comply with the mission of the Library of make collections available for future generations. Failure to procure these supplies could increase security risk for collections and result in permanent loss of LOC collections.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>1.0 Description of Services<br />MSHA is seeking the services of an independent lab to perform air jet sieving particle size analysis of limestone dust in accordance with ASTM Standard C110-11, Section 18.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />Testing is required for samples taken from manufactured material at various underground coal mining operations across the country. The limestone material (rock dust) is applied to underground mine surfaces to safeguard against coal-dust explosions. Federal regulations mandate that 100 percent of the manufactured rock dust material will pass through a sieve having 20 meshes per linear inch and 70 percent or more of which will pass through a sieve having 200 meshes per linear inch.</p>
<p>3.0 Testing and Analysis<br />3.1 Sampling will include approximately 40 samples of limestone material (rock dust). For this set of samples, we are interested in the determination of the amount of material that passes through a 200 mesh sieve. The analysis of these samples has become a high priority so turnaround time is important.<br />3.1.1 Samples delivered will range in weight from approximately 100 grams to 1 pound.<br />3.2 The contractor shall maintain appropriate chain-of-custody, including associated paperwork at all times.<br />3.3 An ISO/CEN 17025 certified contractor is preferred. If possible, sieve testing should be among the fields of testing covered by the scope of the accreditation.<br />3.4 Quality assurance analysis such as duplicate sample determinations, balance calibration verification, and sieve performance (most importantly the minus 200 mesh) are to be included in the quotation.<br />3.4.1 A duplicate analysis is to be completed on every tenth sample and reported.<br />3.4.2 The analytical balances used to weigh the samples must be routinely checked and verified using ASTM certified check weights.<br />3.4.3 The performance of the 200 mesh sieve(s) must be verified using a NIST traceable standard material (RM 8010, D) after every twenty samples.<br />3.5 Analysis is to be performed using the attached Particle Size Analysis of Manufactured Bulk Rock Dust Collected from Underground Coal Mining Operations procedures supplemented by ASTM's C110 air jet sieving through 200 mesh sieves.</p>
<p>4.0 Testing Methods<br />4.1 Testing is to be done according to ISO/IEC 17025 standards and ASTM Standard C110-11, Section 18, Dry Screening of Hydrated Lime, Pulverized Quicklime, and Limestone by Air Jet Sieving.<br />4.2 It may be necessary to dry samples after prolonged periods of storage.</p>
<p>5.0 Contractor Provided Items and Services<br />The contractor shall provide the following items and services to the government, to the parties/locations indicated:<br />5.1 Sample analyses reports to be provided within 30 calendar days of sample receipt. Electronic reports shall be in Adobe Acrobat format, digitally signed and e-mailed to: wesolowski.mark@dol.gov.</p>
<p>6.0 Government Provided Items and Services<br />6.1 The government shall provide the labor and equipment needed to obtain and document the samples, including delivery of the samples to the contractor or shipping company drop off point.<br />6.2 Samples to be returned to Mark Wesolowski upon completion of testing via United Parcel Service (UPS) using the Government provided UPS account number for shipping charges.</p>
<p>Period of performance:<br />30 days from receipt of samples.<br /><br />Place of performance:<br />Work will be performed at the selected vendor's location.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Parts 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 of the SOW.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 15, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned.

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions.

All questions must be submitted at least ten (10) days prior to the closing date of the solicitation. Answers to all questions will be posted via amendments to this solicitation. No personal answers will be provided.
<p>The Pennsylvania section of the North Service Center identified a need for a Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract for repair and alteration construction services over the simplified acquisition threshold, up to prospectus limitations. This procurement will result in multiple awards for projects within these parameters at all locations, owned and leased, within the jurisdiction of the GSA Pittsburgh Field Office, as well as Ohio County in West Virginia (under the jurisdiction of the GSA Charleston Field Office). Using this IDIQ vehicle, ordering officials will place individual task orders utilizing competitive procedures among all vendors awarded contracts through this procurement.</p>
<p>The specific counties not included in these Multiple Award IDIQ contracts are as follows: Pennsylvania - Philadelphia; Delaware; Chester; Montgomery; and, Bucks Counties. All other counties in the state of Pennsylvania are included in this procurement.</p>
<p>The term of the contracts will be for a one (1) year base with four (4) one (1) year options. The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing (except for assorted hourly rates), as projects within this dollar range could have significant variances in unit price values based on the size of the individual project. Rather, each project will be competed among the awardees of the IDIQ contract using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone, or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. All awardees under the IDIQ contract will be presented with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. It is anticipated that no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts will be awarded under this solicitation, although the government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside this range.</p>
<p>The scope of this contract is to provide: 1) construction services, including, but not limited to: general office renovation; interior construction; exterior construction repair; general repair and alteration work; installation of new and the alteration of existing power panels; carpet and carpet tile replacement; painting; HVAC duct work modification; modification of existing building fire sprinkler systems; plastering and plaster repair work; sidewalk repairs/replacement; asphalt/concrete paving; 2) alteration services, including, but not limited to: electrical, carpentry, masonry, plumbing, mechanical, architectural, landscaping, storm drainage, exterior restoration, waterproofing, re-pointing, cleaning, sealing, design-build services; roofing involving installation, repair and alteration, and removal; and paving relevant to property and roads owned, leased or otherwise under the control of GSA, or other authorized Federal agencies; and other task order related work. In addition, design work incidental to construction as well as design/build work are included. .</p>
<p>This procurement will be set aside for small businesses under FAR Part 19; with a multiple award task order contract awarded to responsible offerors whose proposal(s) offer the best overall value to the Government. The individual orders to be placed under the contracts will range from the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000.00) up to the prospectus limit (currently $2.79 million). Task orders may also be placed outside this dollar range if it is in the best interest of the government to do so; however, awardees have the option to decline any RFP's in this case. Utilizing a multiple award IDIQ will maximize competition, as all awardees will compete for each task order, resulting in favorable competitive pricing for GSA.</p>
<p>The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 236220. The contracting specialist will verify that offerors submitting proposals are certified to work within this NAICS code.</p>

  With  No Sensitive but Require Training

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE:

a. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION:

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH:

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 

SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING :

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 

TRAINING:

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior Training.

(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Rules of Behavior. 

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete. 

The Certification and Accreditation (C&A) requirements do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required for this SOW.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p style="tab-stops: 57.0pt">We regret having to take this action, however this decision was necessary due to several converging factors, largely driven by changes to work scope, key tasks, and personnel that have occurred over the time we were conducting the competition. The Department of Homeland Security is also facing shrinking budgets, and has had other program priority changes that impacted this decision.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 57.0pt">We are working now with the Office of Information and Technology program team to redraft the applicable documents to meet U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) changed need for this procurement. The point of contact for this requirement for this re-competed action is Ms. Lea McDaniel, Contracting Officer, who can be reached at <a href="mailto:mindy.l.mcdaniel@cbp.dhs.gov">mindy.l.mcdaniel@cbp.dhs.gov</a>.<br /><br />The Department appreciates your patience and interest in supporting CBP, and looks forward to engaging industry in CBP opportunities in future competitions.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 30 March 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The contracting activity, Fleet Logistics Center San Diego (FLCSD) will process agency protests in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 33.103(d).  Pursuant to FAR 33.103(d)(4), agency protests may be filed directly with the appropriate reviewing authority; or, a protester may appeal a decision rendered by a contracting officer to the reviewing authority.
The reviewing authority for FLCSD is the Director, Regional Contracts Department, Fleet Logistics Center San Diego at 937 North Harbor Drive, San Diego, CA 92132-0060.  Agency procurement protests should clearly identify the initial adjudicating official, i.e., the "contracting officer" or "reviewing official".
Offerors should note this review of the Contracting Officer's decision will not extend GAO's timeliness requirements.  Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.<BR><BR>NON-NAVY OWNED CRANES 
The following is a list of minimum requirements that contractors shall comply with for all contracts that may result in the use of a crane for the accomplishment of work.  (a)	The contractor shall notify the contracting officer, in advance, of the intent of bringing a non-Navy owned crane onto a Navy shore installation.  All entries shall be through a prearranged entry point.(b)	The contractor shall comply with the applicable American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards (e.g., B30.5 for mobile cranes, B30.22 for articulating boom cranes, B30.3 for construction tower cranes, and B30.8 for floating cranes).  For barge mounted mobile cranes, a load indicating device, a wind indicating device, and a marine type list indicator readable in one-half degree increments are required.  In addition, the contractor shall comply with specific naval crane safety and operation regulations/standards specifically required by the Navy shore installation and state or local Government.(c)	The contractor shall certify that the crane and rigging gear meets applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations by providing a Certificate of Compliance.  The Certificate, figure P-1, appendix P-1 of Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) P-307 ?Management of Weight Handling Equipment?, can be downloaded from the NAVFAC Naval Crane Center website, http://ncc.navfac.navy.mil/crane/307jun03.pdf.

For cranes at Naval activities in foreign countries, the contractor shall certify that the crane and rigging gear conform to the appropriate host country safety standards.  The contractor shall also certify that all of its crane operators working in the naval activity have been trained not to bypass safety devices (e.g., anti-two block devices) during lifting operations.  The Certification of Compliance form shall be posted on the crane.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add the Questions and Answers.  If the "chart" is not clear, please send an email to have this emailed to you.  Email me at yates.william@epa.gov.  Please see the following:
SOL-CI-12-00034 RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Question 1:  The RFQ mentioned a pricing schedule, and It lists estimated annual usage.  Are we supposed to provide pricing based on that section?
Answer 1:  Please provide pricing based on the Section D of the PWS.
Question/Comment 2:  My group is the Brokerage, and we pick up and transport less-than-load quantities of waste for disposal.  We can provide packaging services, but we usually have a description of the waste, including isotopic information.  The RFQ mentioned dismantling equipment, and demolition waste, and providing waste characterization, etc.  We can provide these services, but from the RFQ I cannot tell if this is just a Brokerage job or if it is a D&D job that would involve our Field Services group.    Answer 2:  D&D (Demolition and Decommissioning Services) are not necessary or included as part of the scope of work.  Dismantling of equipment would be as needed to facilitate shipping preparation or to prepare materials already removed from the facility for final disposal.  Demolition waste handling would only be after the demolition process.  Waste characterization would also be limited to determination of proper disposal.  A majority of waste would be characterized and would only require pickup, and disposal.   Packaging may be completed prior to pickup from containers supplied by the vendor or by the vendor upon arrival and would be determined prior to scheduled waste pickup.Question 3:  There is no indication as to the radionuclides involved or the activities. It is likely that no contractor can adequately respond as there is currently no disposal option for radioactive sealed sources originating in your state.Answer 3:  Shipment frequency will vary depending on work between monthly to annually.   Estimate 2 to 4 shipments a year total.
Radionuclide	Chemical/Physical Form	Expected Waste StreamsHydrogen-3 	Any	Class A - Dry solids, Aqueous liquids, Liquid/Organic SolventCarbon-14 	Any	Class A - Dry solids, Aqueous liquids, Liquid/Organic SolventSulfur-35 	Any	Class A - Dry solids, Aqueous liquidsCobalt-57 	Sealed source (WEB Research Co. Inc. Model No. MCO 7 Series) 	Transfer to authorized user/return to manufacturerNatural Uranium 	Any	Class A - Dry solid, Aqueous liquidsRadium 226/228 	Any	Class A - Dry solid, Aqueous liquidsNickel-63 	Any foil or plated sources in detector cells approved for licensing purposes by the NRC or an Agreement State 	Source transfer to authorized user/return to manufacturer
Question 4:  1) Can you define the quantity / volume of waste to be disposed
2) Can you define the frequency these shipments will be taking place
3) In order to submit accurate pricing can you identify the contaminantsof concern as well as radionuclide inventoryAnswer 4:  See answer number 3 and refer to section D of the PWS which has been attached to the Question and Answer responses.Question 5:  My question is can a teaming partner hold the required licenses and permits or is it a requirement that the small business hold them?
Answer 5:  If you are in a teaming arrangement, the ?team? will be looked upon as one entity.  You will want to provide a copy of your teaming agreement.  Please note that the requirement states that "The contractor must be appropriately licensed and/or permitted to perform the work described in this Statement of Work."Question 6:1.       Is this a new requirement?2.       Who is the current contractor performing these services?3.       What is the amount of the previous contract?4.       Has the scope increased or decreased?
Answer 6:  
1.  A BPA did exist prior to this, but expired in January of 2011.  It was EP-C-08-000052.2.  No current contractor has this requirement.3.  I do not have exact figures, but costs per year were estimated in the prior contract as $15,875.  In the last two years, we spent less than $3000 each year.4.   Scope has remained the same with fluctuations in waste generation based upon decommissioning work within the facility. Question 7:  To handle radioactive waste disposal material, is there requirement to use hydrogen gas detector?  If it used nuclear fuel, and if it will be packed in metal container, it need to be zero-leak tight, and check if there is no leak point by sensitive hydrogen specific detector.Answer 7:  There will be no nuclear fuel shipments, and no hydrogen detectors are required.
PWS is added to the question and answer section for your review.&#8195;ATTACHMENT A: SCOPE OF WORK

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please find the&nbsp;attached Industry Forum&nbsp;flyer containing&nbsp;registration details and instructions for attending the&nbsp;Industry Forum scheduled on 22 March 2012. <br /><br /><br /></span>The Industry Forum previously scheduled for Tuesday, 27 March 2012, as reflected in this Request for Information (RFI) #2, is changed to Thursday, 22 March 2012. All other information reflected in the RFI remains unchanged. Registration instructions will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities Website. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. <br /><br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong> The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the Government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330 and 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. <strong>(NOTE: Effective 12 March 2012, the size standard will be $14.0M for NAICS code 541330.)</strong> The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) contracts to large and small businesses. In addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts, we are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for Continental United States (CONUS) (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services) will be similar for all contracts. The type of projects/programs for the worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects. The type of projects/programs for the regional suites will include SRM projects.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) contracts to small businesses. The scope of A-E services will include Title I/II &amp; Other A-E Services. The types of projects/programs will include Environmental Remediation, Environmental Compliance (EC), and Environmental Quality (EQ) projects. Work will be performed primarily in CONUS. There may be a small amount of OCONUS work anticipated.</p>
<p>All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with two additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.</strong> These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ENGINEERING SERVICES</span> (NAICS 541330)<br /></strong>To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM requirements. Requirements for CONUS regional suites will include SRM projects. Requirements for worldwide suites will include MILCON, MFH, SRM and Contingency projects.

<p><strong>Request comment from interested parties to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. What are your thoughts about separating the A-E requirements into two separate contracts, Environmental Remediation (NAICS 562910) and Engineering Services (541330)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Environmental Remediation Services (NAICS 562910) only (questions 2 &amp;3)</span></strong></p>
<p>2. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about setting aside all environmental remediation requirements to small business?</p>
<p>3. What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In regard to Engineering Services (NAICS 541330) only (questions 4-6)</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about reserving all of the CONUS regional contracts for small business?</p>
<p>5. As previously noted, some CONUS projects may be issued against the worldwide contracts. What would your recommended project parameters include (i.e. "X" dollar value, "X" project type) to move a requirement from a regional CONUS contract to the worldwide contract?</p>
<p>6. There is a potential to establish only three regions (i.e. East, West and Central) for the CONUS Engineering Services efforts. Do you have any thoughts or concerns about your firm's capacity to cover large CONUS regions?</p>
<p>7. Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to share with us?</p>
<p>Please include the following with your response: name and address of firm; size of business; point of contact and telephone number, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees, classification standard i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, etc, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners.</p>

<DESC>The following answers are in response to PWS questions/comments (Q/C) from industry received as of 16 February 2011.<BR><BR>Q/C 1.  RE: 3.14.12 Small Business Consideration.  All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees. If after a three (3) day period two or more Small Business awardees indicate that they will not or cannot fulfill the requirement, it will then be solicited to all contract awardees regardless of size.  We recommend that the small business consideration value threshold be increased from $1 Million to between $5-$10 Million. The rationale is based on historical data from the current WWSS contract vehicle. This data indicates the vast majority of WWSS awards were in excess of $1 Million. To incentivize small business participation, the pool of potential procurements that will be set -aside for small business consideration needs to be significant enough to be meaningful in promoting small business.<BR><BR>A1.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C2.  RE: CLIN Sheet Format Structure / Price Evaluation.  Although not contained within the draft PWS, we would like to make some recommendation /suggestions for consideration regarding the structure of the CLIN Sheet that may be used / standardized for GTACS RTEP's:<BR>a) Based upon past CLIN Sheets provided in WWSS procurements, we suggests price evaluations be done for each CLIN versus one lump sum total. This recommendation is made so as to prevent Bidders from "gaming" the procurement. Although the Government is still responsible for evaluating price realism for individual CLIN's, the "lump sum" price evaluation structure can lend itself to juggling individual CLIN pricing for pricing strategy purposes and not cost-based purposes.<BR>b) Further to the issue preventing "gaming" and creating an environment for the Government to better assess pricing, we suggests that the Government clearly specify its intentions relative to the exercise of options. Many times for WWSS, CLIN's for optional quantities were presented that looked like the following:<BR><BR>OPTIONS, POP through XX Month Year Total<BR><BR>001 AA 2.0 Widget # 6-50 45<BR>002 AA 2.0 Widget # 51-100 50<BR>003 AA 2.0 Widget # 101-200 100<BR>004 AA 2.0 Widget # 201-300 100<BR>005 AA 2.0 Widget # 301-500 200<BR><BR>Continuing the example, let's assume the Government has identified needs to procure a total quantity of 350 widgets over time. First point is, if he intent is to procure 350, consider one CLIN for 350 period versus a option ladder as depicted above. If funding, mission requirements, etc prevent one single CLIN for the total required quantity, then clearly indicate to industry how the total number will be ordered. Using the sample option ladder above, if 150 widgets are to be procured over time, would the Government execute CLIN's 001 (QTY:50) and 002 (QTY:100) to procure the 150 units, or execute CLIN 003 for 150 units.  Please convey to Industry the manner in which the CLIN's will be utilized. The obvious answer is whatever is in the Government's best interest. That is understood. The situation from Industry's perspective is it may have to protect itself by not providing the quantity discount until the next higher quantity CLIN. For example, assume the procurement is for 150 units. Further assume there is a real production quantity price break from underlying suppliers at the QTY 75 level. The Contractor may not be able to pass this discount on until CLIN 003 if the Government has the option to procure just 65 units under CLIN 002 as an example.  This is admittedly somewhat complicated and confusing to convey. The bottom line recommendation is to allow industry to structure its own optional CLIN's with quantity ranges that provide the most competitive position and ultimately the best value to the Government.  If this cannot be done, then clearly state how quantities of options will be procured per the Option Ladder spreadsheet that is presented as part of the RTEP.<BR><BR>A2.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C3.  PWS 3.9 says that contractors are "not to establish relationships with other GTACS contractors, subcontractors or vendors......." This language implies that companies may not be on more than one team for the bid. Is that the Government's intention or is this language more applicable to collaboration amongst awardees after contract award?<BR> <BR>A3.  The reference PWS 3.9 is in reference to a conflict of interest only. The government encourages Contractors, Subcontractors and Vendors to team partner and or enter into any agreement that does not create a conflict of interest.  Excerpt from the PWS: "3.9 The Contractor agrees to accept and to complete all awarded DOs/TOs and not to establish relationships with other GTACS Contractors, Subcontractor or Vendors in a manner as to create an actual or perceived organizational conflict of interest."  <BR><BR>Q/C4.  Also, considering teammates may be non exclusive to a prime offeror, there most likely will be instances where companies appear on multiple teams.  Is it permissible to be a subcontractor on multiple teams?<BR><BR>A4.  Multiple team participation is permitted.<BR><BR>Q/C5.  Regarding vendors, many vendors, equipment manufacturers and service providers do not typically team exclusively as a business practice. Is it permissible for a vendor to be on multiple teams?<BR><BR>A5.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C6.  Since there are both full and open and small business set aside awards anticipated, is it permissible for an offeror to be both a subcontractor and a prime offeror?  Note that at the June industry day, the government encouraged "cross teaming".  As a result, teaming engagements made early on may conflict with the language in PWS 3.9<BR><BR>A6.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C7.  PWS 3.14.12 states that the threshold for competing set aside TOs among SBs is $1M.  This seems inconsistent with the NAICS code SB size standard of 750 employees and a program ceiling of $10B.  A qualified company with an employee base as little as 50 or up to 750 employees will be easily capable of and extensively experienced with TO thresholds will above $1M.  Will the Government consider increasing the set aside threshold to $5M?<BR><BR>A7.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C8.  The Draft PWS paragraph 3.1 Contract Type states, "The Government intends to award ... approximately 6 to 15 contracts."  Is there a further breakdown for number of contracts to be awarded between large and small businesses?<BR><BR>A8.  Please refer to Q/C24. <BR><BR>Q/C9.  Draft PWS Paragraph 3.3 Place of Performance - are there any special site specific requirements for Contractor Sites?<BR><BR>A9.  Hardware and services will be purchased and supplied worldwide, and may have a requirement for a security level of up to and including top secret in individual DO/TO<BR><BR>Q/C10.  Draft PWS Paragraph 3.13.3 Services - will government make the QASP available in advance of the RFP?<BR><BR>A10.  Each delivery order will be unique in nature as such each QASP will depend on each DOs requirements.<BR><BR>Q/C11.  Draft PWS Paragraph 3.14.3 TEP - states, "the TEP size shall not exceed twenty (20) total text pages."  Does this page limitation include both technical/management and the cost part of the DO/TO proposal?<BR><BR>A11.  Yes that is correct.<BR><BR>Q/C12.  Draft PWS Paragraph 4.2 - contract vehicles.  For all the PM's and PDs areas listed, what acquisition vehicles are currently being used?   Is there an archive of DO/TOs awarded?<BR><BR>A12.  There is no complete archive of contractual vehicles that is known that plans to utilize the GTACS contract, other than to say that any of contracts currently supporting the Program Executive Office - Command, Control, Communications Tactical (PEO C3T) are likely candidates to utilize the GTACS contract.<BR><BR>Q/C13.   SAMPLE TASK The draft PWS does not include sample task(s). Recommend that care is exercised in the scoping and selection of sample tasks. Some Federal procurement documents have crafted sample tasks in a manner that unnecessarily limits the participation of small business respondees. One example of this is to write a sample task of scope and scale that only a large business could possibly respond to and then cutting a percentage or portion of the work out for small business responses that in order to adequately answer, still require a complete build-out of an entire system or network (for example) to provide a proposed solution for.<BR><BR>A13.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C14.   SAMPLE TASK Recommend that the evaluation sample task include a task that is representative of the types of small business tasks that will be issued under the awarded contract. <BR><BR>A14.  The government will take this under consideration and the contracting officer in conjunction with the Small business office will make a determination. <BR><BR>Q/C15.   MISSION ALIGNMENT The current iteration of the PWS emphasizes ACAT program level activities and efforts. The stated purpose of GTACS is to have the flexibility to support the GRRIP program, NRRC C3T missions, and DoD Interagency Information Sharing. Recommend that an effort is made to ensure that the PWS does not over-emphasize or solely focus on the ACAT program level of support at the expense of including the appropriate scoping to support the wide range of support services needed across all three support areas. <BR><BR>A15.  The government will take this under consideration.<BR><BR>Q/C16.   CLARIFY TASK What is the relationship between Tasks, Task Areas, and Services in PWS section 3.3? Recommend ensuring alignment and clarity between sections C, L, sample tasks, and M. A point of frustration to RFP respondents are mismatches between these sections that presents challenges when preparing written responses that address the evaluation factors, the PWS, and sample tasks while complying with section L. Recommend providing draft sections L and M to industry for comment.<BR><BR>A16.  Draft Section L&M are anticipated to be released for comment prior to release of the final RFP.  The anticipated release date for the DRAFT Sections L & M has not yet been determined.<BR><BR>Q/C17.  COMMENT 5: CLARIFY 3.1.4 SECURITY This work requires that personnel hold a Top Secret clearance. Contractors must hold a top secret facility clearance to be able to provide these personnel. Should paragraph 3.1.4 be modified to require contractors to have a Top Secret facility clearance with secret safeguarding capability?<BR><BR> A17.  If you are referring to Section 3.8 of the released PWS -Security - Security clearance requirements for All Contractor facilities shall provide an appropriate means of storage for classified documents, classified equipment and materials, and non-classified equipment and materials, in accordance with Operational Security (OPSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC) requirements.  If this is referring to Section 3.4 Facilities - this section refers to government facilities.<BR><BR>Q/C18.  6: 3.2.3 TASK EXECUTION PLAN (TEP) This paragraph requires that contractors submit a TEP within 14 days of receipt of a request for a TEP. For more complex systems (e.g. systems with a large, complex Bill of Materials), 14 days to develop a response may not be reasonable. We recommend that the Government consider including language such as "Unless other specified by the Government" to permit longer responses in these more complex requirements. <BR><BR>A18.  Excerpt from PWS Paragraph 3.14.3 "The Contracting Officer will determine the amount of time allowed for the Contractor to submit a TEP.  On average this will be seven to fourteen calendar days from receipt of the RTEP".<BR><BR>Q/C19.  CLARIFY 3.2.4 TEP APPROVAL Please clarify the basis of award for TEPs. Recommend the use of best value evaluations and source selections.<BR><BR>A19.  The basis of award for TEPs will be determined on a case by case basis. <BR><BR>Q/C20.  Section 1.0 SCOPE 4th paragraph.  The new PWS includes secure communications "...secure communications such as cryptosecurity, transmission security, emission security, traffic-flow security and physical security ..." However, there are no additional details in Section 4.0 Contract Tasks where other Tasking Descriptions are discussed. Could you provide details on the secure communication related tasks that may be included in TO/DO?<BR><BR>A20.  The Sample Tasks will provide the details that the Offeror is expected to bid on.<BR><BR>Q/C21.  Section 4.3.  The Section 4.3 title is "Command Control and Communications - Tactical (C3T) Systems remove". Could you clarify what the word "remove" at end of title indicates?<BR><BR>A21.  That word was a mistype and has been removed.<BR><BR>Q/C22.  Section 4.3.  On the larger end of the spectrum, up to what size antenna dish is expected for GTACS related terminals.  Would these include trailer and/or vehicle mounted systems?  Or are these only single operator transportable systems?<BR><BR>A22.  The Sample Tasks will provide the details that the Offeror is expected to bid on.<BR><BR>Q/C23.  Section 4.3.  Will GTACS only provide Element Management for SATCOM terminal specific hardware and utilize higher echelon Network Management systems from POR such as WIN-T or DGS?  Alternatively, will GTACS procure an overall cross-domain end-to-end network management system?<BR><BR>A23.  GTACS is designed to provide support to Programs of Record and as such can be utilized to support all of the efforts above however for this bid the Sample Tasks will provide the details that the Offeror is expected to bid on.<BR><BR>Q/C24.  3.1 Contract Type:  The Draft PWS states "approximately 6 to 15 contracts are anticipated". Could you clarify the driving factors which will determine the ultimate number or awards, and how many are anticipated for small business?<BR><BR>A24.  Each proposal will be evaluated against the RFP criteria and the mix of Large/Small business Awards will be made after the review of the proposals.<BR><BR>Q/C25.  3.6 Personnel:  First paragraph seems to conflict with Performance Based and Incentive Fee task orders; i.e., no opportunity for contractor to deliver efficiencies.  First paragraph: Will the Government provide a master list of labor categories and qualifications at the contract level? <BR>Last paragraph: This is unclear, i.e., what are "normal" workdays?  Does this preclude 7-day operations?<BR><BR>A25.  The Government will provide a list of labor categories however that Offeror can chose to use their own as long as there is a cross reference to the Government categories.  In either case personnel must be fully qualified for the tasks they are performing.  Because of the broadness of the scope of the contract the Normal Work Day/Work Week is anticipated to be identified on a DO/TO basis, however the Government is not limiting the Offerors and they are encouraged to bid as they see fit.<BR><BR>Q/C26.  3.14.3.1 TEP Preparation: sub para a. - The PWS does not specify "Option" periods, only basic contract years sub para b. - T&M contract type is not specified elsewhere in the PWS<BR><BR>A26.  This is a five year IDIQ each DO/TO will be competed and may have options associated with them.  T&M will be removed from all reference material. There will be no T&M on this contract.<BR><BR>Q/C27.  3.14.12 Small Business Consideration:  Will small business, set-aside delivery/task orders be limited to small business, GTACS primes? Will large business, GTACS primes using 51% - or more - small business participation in their TEP and task execution be eligible for small business set-aside awards?<BR><BR>A27.  Only small businesses can prime a contract in the Restricted/Small Lot.  If a large business wants to play in that lot they must be a sub to a small company and the small business must do 51% on each deliver order they win.<BR><BR>Q/C28.  4.2 Projects, Programs, Products:  Believe PD C-RAM is no longer under PEO C3T<BR><BR>A28.  This list is not all inclusive and this contract is focused on C3T not necessarily PEO C3T<BR><BR>Q/C29.  Reference Draft PWS dated 14 January 2011, the following note is in Section 3.14.3.3, as follows:  Note: The GTACS Office plans to transition the RTEP and TEP submission process from an e-mail or SharePoint delivery to a web-based management information system approach to facilitate ease of management for both Government and GTACS contractors.  The Contractor shall transition its approach for preparation and submission of TEPs as directed by the Contracting Officer at no additional cost to the Government.  Can you define/identify what this web-based management information system is/will be?  Is it an off-the-shelf product or, if a Government product, will it be provided to winning contractors as GFE?<BR><BR>A29.  As of yet the program has not been defined <BR><BR>Q/C30.  As GTACS will be a broad-based IDIQ contract, primes will be working to bring companies onto their teams to satisfy listed, but general requirements - many which will only be defined during the TEP/RTEP process.  The question is, will the Government allow for the addition of new contractors to a winning prime team after contract award?<BR><BR>A30.  The request for the replacement of a sub-contractor after contract award shall be formally made to the contracting officer in writing - along with accompanying rationale for replacement.  The KO will take this information into consideration and either provide or deny this request.  <BR><BR>Q/C31.  The Government announced its intention to release a DRAFT version of Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria, on or about 11 February 2011.  Does the Government plan to release a DRAFT version of a SECTION B, which is required to properly review the evaluation requirements so that industry can provide meaningful comments back to the Government? <BR><BR>A31.  At this time the government does not anticipate releasing a DRAFT section B.  The release date for the DRAFT Sections L & M has not yet been determined.<BR><BR>Q/C32.  Potential tasks under the IDIQ Contract may require use of a wide variety of COTS hardware and software products.  Will the IDIQ vehicle allow trade evaluation and purchase of COTS from any potential vendor, or must teams arrange for pre-vetted technology vendors on their teams to utilize COTS? <BR><BR>A.32. The Government does not limit the Offeror from purchasing COTS from any vendor to support its bid.<BR><BR>Q/C33.  Does the Government plan to issue a pipeline of the RTEPs planned for release to include Scope of Work, location and anticipated release date after award of the IDIQ vehicle?<BR><BR>A33.  The government will issue an RTEP whenever a requirement is received.<BR><BR>Q/C34.  Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?<BR><BR>A34.  Construction will not be part of this contract and all references will be removed from the PWS.<BR><BR>Q/C35.   RE: Pg: 7, Sec: 3.2, The period of performance is five (5) years from effective date of award.  Will there be 5 base years and no option years or will it be 1 base year with 4 option years?<BR><BR>A35.  This is a five year IDIQ each DO/TO will be competed and may have options associated with them<BR><BR>Q/C36.    RE: Pg: 6, Sec: 3.1.  The Government intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract, and approximately 6 to 15 contracts are anticipated.  <BR>RE: Pg: 16, Sec: 3.14.12.  All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/ production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees.  How many of the approximately 6 to 15 awards will be set-aside for small businesses?<BR><BR>A36.  This will vary depending on the number of acceptable awards. <BR><BR>Q/C37.  RE: Pg: 17, Sec: 4.1.1 This task area includes the design, development, fabrication, and testing of engineering developmental systems covering the complete range of tactical C3 systems.  The sentence as written would require contractors to design, develop, fabricate, and test engineering developmental systems.  What is meant by engineering developmental system? What is an engineering developmental system?<BR><BR>A37.  An engineering developmental system is a system that the Offeror used to test the design of a system during development before the initial production base line has been approved. <BR><BR>Q/C38.  Sec: 3.1 Contract Type, Pg: 6-7.  We recommend 15 awards, with up to 3 small business reserves.  DPWS shows the Government has designed GTACS to support a broad array of technologies, services and solutions. Because of the diversity of missions/capabilities PEO C3T may service via GTACS, a higher number of prime awards within the range specified provides the Government a competitive field of preferred providers across all requirements.<BR><BR>A38.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C39.  Sec: 3.9 Organizational Conflict of Interest, Pg: 9. The DPWS mentions several times that SETA work will not be performed on GTACS and that organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) might arise for current SETA contractors. OCI is further detailed in section 3.9. We suggest that the Government restrict significant PEO C3T SETA contractors from bidding as a prime.  It is highly likely that if SETA contractors are allowed to prime GTACS that many sub-contractors will not be given fair opportunity to submit responses to RTEPs, because their prime contractor has OCI concerns.  This will restrict the Government from potentially getting the best value solution without access to those subcontractors.<BR><BR>A39.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C40.  Sec: 3.10 Non- Developmental Items and Processes, Pg: 9. we recommend that all bidding primes be original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and/or organic providers of Non- Developmental Items (NDI) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products GTACS is a hardware/solutions focused vehicle. Primes need to have engineering, program/product management, and supply chain management expertise to credibly service mission critical requirements.<BR><BR>A40.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C41.  Sec: 3.13.2 Software, Pg: 10.  We agree that it is in the Government's best interest for software development that the prime contractor shall maintain a software quality system which operates at a Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 systems/software processes capability (or equivalent SEI rating). We concur it is in the Government's best interest that the prime contractors should be required to meet this criteria.  Requiring all prime contractors meet this important quality standard ensures that all prime contractors understand, have quality oversight, controls, and can support the software development, resulting in a high quality and timely delivery to the Government.<BR><BR>A41.  The Government appreciates the concurrence.<BR><BR>Q/C42.  Sec: 3.14 Contract Management, Pg: 11.  Recommend all bidding primes must have a Defense Control Management Agency (DCMA) approved Earned Value Management System (EVMS) at time of proposal submission GTACS is established to support a diversity of technologies, missions, and contract types. The Government will need well-established mechanisms to monitor progress of task execution plans (TEPs). A DCMA approved EVMS will provide a validated approach to ease this Government management need via management systems, planning and budgeting, accounting, analysis, and revision activities.<BR><BR>A42.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C43.  Sec: 3.14.1 Work Control, Pg: 11.  Recommend all bidding primes must have a fully functional web-based task order management system accessible by the Government for status/tracking at time of proposal submission. Once the GTACS vehicle is awarded, task execution volume will create a greater need for ease of management by ACC-APG and PEO C3T personnel. A password authenticated, web-based portal will enable the Government to have real-time access to current status at time of need.<BR><BR>A43.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C44.  Sec: 3.14.3.1 TEP Preparation for all Orders, Pg: 12.  Type of Contract (T&M, FFP, CR) - is sole appearance of T&M contract type in all of the Draft GTACS PWS. Should it be stricken?  Clarify contract types included in GTACS.<BR><BR>A44.  T&M will be removed from all reference material. There will be no T&M on this contract.<BR><BR>Q/C45.  Sec: 3.14.3.3 TEPs for Cost Reimbursement Orders, Pg: 13.  It is stated that labor categories will be used for cost reimbursement orders. It is expected that GTACS TEPs will generally be more hardware focused than services focused. With this in mind, we encourage the Government evaluate labor category pricing only as it relates directly to the sample tasks.  This will provide the Government the opportunity to achieve price realism that relates closer to the RTEPs that are likely to be issued under GTACS.  This will also avoid the unintended consequences of valuating and awarding, based on pricing of a large set of labor categories and assumed hours that are not a true metric to delivering the tactical communications systems that will be the bulk of the GTACS TEPs.<BR><BR>A45.  The Government will take this suggestion under consideration and the Contracting Office will make the final decision when the final RFP is released.<BR><BR>Q/C46.  We suggest that the sample tasks be priced and awardable.  By requiring priced sample tasks and preferably by awarding these, the Government will receive more accurate and reasonable price and technical data to evaluate. This puts the onus on the contractors to submit "realistic" values and put forth the most technically sound solutions.<BR><BR>A47.  The Sample Tasks are representative of similar tasks that will be awarded under this contract however the sample tasks themselves will not be awarded.<BR><BR>Q/C48.  Will GTACS be a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) (e.g. other government entities will be able to use the vehicle)?<BR><BR>A48.  Yes <BR><BR>Q/C49.  Will MIPR of funds from other agencies into PEO C3-T be allowed on this contract?<BR><BR>A49.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C50.  On Material Purchases, will there be a pre-established cap on prime contractor fee?<BR><BR>A50.  No, everything will be competed on a full and open basis.<BR><BR>Q/C51.  On work performed by subcontractors, will there be a pre-established cap on prime contractor fee?<BR><BR>A51.  No, everything will be competed on a full and open basis.<BR><BR>Q/C52.  What is the expected mix of Material Purchase vs. Services provided?  During Industry day in July 2010, the KO had announced a 60% Material and a 40% Services mix.  Will this stay the same of some other anticipated mix? <BR><BR>A52. The mix will change however we are anticipating 70%-30% mix of Material and Service in support of said material.<BR><BR><BR>Q/C53.  Based on section 4.2 of the Draft PWS, is the intent to move all stated supporting efforts to the GTACS IDIQ contract or will these efforts be allowed to continue under their existing contracts? <BR><BR>A53. GTACS is an open contract to support all PEOC3-T efforts; it is up to the individual organization to decide how they want to manage their individual programs.<BR><BR>Q/C54. Will any of the 5 Sample tasks be executable?<BR><BR>A54. No  <BR><BR>Q/C55.  Section 4.3 of the PWS states, "Command Control and Communications - Tactical (C3T) Systems remove." Is it the government's intent to remove this PWS paragraph?  <BR><BR>A55. No, the word remove was a mistype and has been removed.<BR><BR>Q/C56.  PWS Paragraph 3.6 - Personnel - Labor requirement will be specified in the RTEP.  Will there be categories or rates at the IDIQ level?<BR><BR>A56. Categories only the Offeror will propose rates.<BR><BR>Q/C57.  PWS Paragraph 3.12 - Travel - All travel requests must be approved in writing by the government.  Who has the authority to approve (KO, COR, COTR, etc.)? <BR><BR>A57.  Only the Contracting Officer (KO) has authority to obligate government funds.  The KO will work in coordination with the COR on such issues.<BR><BR>Q/C 58.  PWS Paragraph 3.13.1 - Hardware - The contractor must maintain a quality assurance system to ensure product integrity.  Is the quality assurance system mandatory at the prime and/or subcontractor level?  If subcontractors have the applicable systems in place, is this sufficient? <BR><BR>A58.  The Prime Contractor will be held responsible for the quality or their products and the system that assures that quality.<BR><BR>Q/C59.  PWS Paragraph 3.13.2 - Software - The contractor must maintain a software quality system.  Is the software quality system mandatory at the prime and/or subcontractor level?  If subcontractors have the applicable systems in place, is this sufficient?<BR><BR>A59.  The Prime Contractor will be held responsible for the quality or their products and the system that assures that quality.<BR><BR><BR>Q/C60.  PWS Paragraph 3.14 - Contract Management - We have been directed to establish a single focal point for all administrative, financial, and managerial aspects of this IDIQ.  Does this constitute a PMO and will these functions be setup as direct or indirect charges?<BR><BR>A60. This is for a single point of contact, not a PMO.<BR><BR>Q/C61.  PWS Paragraph 3.14.3 - Task Execution Plan - Are we required to submit "No Bid" notices? <BR><BR>A61.  No response will be taken as a no-bid.<BR><BR>Q/C62.  PWS Paragraph 3.14.3.1 - TEP Preparation for all Orders - It is directed that we prepare our submittals in MS Office.  We do this, but we PDF our submissions to the government.  This reduces their file sizes and prevents unauthorized changes.  Will the government accept submissions in this format?<BR><BR>A62.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C63.  PWS Paragraph 4.5.11 - Certification - Similar to the questions for Hardware and Software, are certifications required at the prime level? Or is subcontractor certification sufficient?<BR><BR>A63.  All certifications are managed at the system level; as such the Prime is responsible for all certifications.<BR><BR>Q/C64.  What is the expected date for release of the final RFP?<BR><BR>A64.  It is anticipated to be the Second Qtr of calendar year 2011.<BR><BR>Q/C65.  Will companies be allowed to participate on more than one team?<BR><BR>A65.  Yes<BR><BR>Q/C66.  RE: Paragraph 3.14.12:  What is the Small Business (SB) subcontracting goal? In addition, what will be the percentage breakout between the different categories of SB?<BR><BR>A66.  That information will be contained in future DRAFT section L & M releases.<BR><BR>Q/C67.  RE: Paragraph 4.1:  What Task Areas will have Sample Task Orders?<BR><BR>A67.  The Government does not intend to release a draft version of the Sample Tasks.  No information regarding the sample tasks will be released prior to the final RFP.<BR><BR>Q/C68.  RE: Paragraph 4.1:  Will the government define what type of Sample Task Orders they expect to release with the RFP, for example SATCOM, etc.?<BR><BR>A68.  The Sample Tasks are representative of similar tasks that will be awarded under this contract however they sample tasks themselves will not be awarded. The Government does not intend to release a draft version of the Sample Tasks.  No information regarding the sample tasks will be released prior to the final RFP.<BR><BR>Q/C69  RE: Paragraph 3.2:  Is this a five (5) year base contract or are there option years?<BR><BR>A69.  This is a five year IDIQ each DO/TO will be competed and may have options associated with them.<BR><BR><BR>Q/C70.  RE: Paragraph 3.9:  Can the government provide a list of the companies that are OCI?<BR><BR>A70.  The government will not be providing a list of the companies that are OCI.<BR><BR>Q/C71.  RE: Paragraph 3.10:  Please define Non-Developmental Items (NDI)?<BR><BR>A71.  Per Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.101(b)(2) "Nondevelopmental item" means-<BR>(1) Any previously developed item of supply used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the United States has a mutual defense cooperation agreement; (2) Any item described in paragraph (1) of this definition that requires only minor modification or modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace in order to meet the requirements of the procuring department or agency; or (3) Any item of supply being produced that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) or (2) solely because the item is not yet in use.<BR><BR>Q/C72.  RE: Paragraph 3.13.2:  Will the Prime be able to use their subcontractors CMMI ratings to meet this requirement? <BR><BR>A72.  Only if said subcontractor will definitely be utilized to provide the expected services in the future. <BR><BR>Q/C73.  RE: Paragraph 4.1.2:  Will the Government provide a list of GOTS equipment?<BR><BR>A73.  GOTS will be defined at the DO/TO level based on the requirements.  <BR><BR>2/8/2011 3:00 pm		Michelle Giller of Raytheon<BR><BR>Q/C 74.  Much of the equipment referred to is emphasized to be COTS products that are already on GSA and other government purchasing arrangements with standard pricing, etc. What is the role of the pricing to be provided under GTACS vs. other standing arrangements?<BR><BR>A74.  Because the GTACS contract will be a contract with a relatively broad scope that encompasses all aspects of hardware and support services in support of PEO C3T programs, although many of the items to be purchased will be COTs items, there will also be requirements for more sophisticated integrated COTS, GOTS and developmental items to fulfill specific needs.<BR><BR>Q/C75.  Paragraph 3.3.1 Technical Expert Status Accreditation (TESA) addresses only Korea. In general we have seen TESA mainly in discussions about Germany/Europe. Will GTACS have potential scope in Europe and thus will TESA apply there?<BR><BR>A75.  This Paragraph is currently under review.<BR><BR>Q/C76.  Paragraph 4.5.7, Leasing of Communication and Transmission Systems, Facilities, and Equipment, states that GTACS will have this included within its scope. Will there be a requirement to coordinate with extant contracts with similar scope currently managed by DISA for DoD-wide use?<BR><BR>A76.  There is the potential to manage interfaces to the GIG managed by DISA. <BR><BR><BR>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 25 February 2011, 12:00 PM.<BR><BR>Q1.  Does the government still plan to release drafts of section L & M for the upcoming GTACS procurement?<BR><BR>A1.  Yes, the release date for the DRAFT Sections L & M has not yet been determined.<BR><BR>Q2.  Has the Draft RFP been released?<BR><BR>A2.  No<BR><BR>Q3.  Has a new timeframe been determined?<BR><BR>A3. No<BR><BR>Q4.  Has a timeframe been determined for the full RFP?<BR><BR>A4.

<DESC>ATTACHED IS A DRAFT OF AN OCI CLAUSE SIMILAR TO WHAT WILL BE IN THE GLOBAL TACTICAL ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS (GTACS) SOLICITATION, AND SIMILAR TO THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) CLAUSE THAT WILL APPEAR IN MOST SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (SETA) SUPPORT CONTRACTS.<br>  <br>BECAUSE OF THE BROAD SCOPE OF THE GTACS CONTRACT AND SITUATIONS WHERE POTENTIAL OFFERORS CURRENTLY PROVIDE SETA SUPPORT SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST TO DEVELOP SUCH AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 9.5.<br>  <br>EACH OFFEROR SHOULD REVIEW FAR 9.5 AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE EXTENT WHICH SUCH AN OCI MAY ARISE BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION TO COMPETE FOR THE GTACS EFFORT.<br>  <br>H-1 52.6001 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST / MARCH 2011<br> <br>Specific fill-in information will be provided as appropriate on a Task Order basis.<br><br>(a) Definition.<br>Per FAR 2.101, an organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the persons objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. It does not include the normal flow of benefits from incumbency.<br><br>(b) The Contracting Officer has determined that potentially significant organizational conflicts of interest may arise due to the nature of the work the Contractor will perform under this contract that may preclude the Contractor from being awarded future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts in a related area. Whereas the Contractor shall be ineligible to act as a prime contractor, consultant, or subcontractor to provide the equipment, items and services, it is agreed that the Contractor shall be ineligible to act as a prime contractor, consultant, or subcontractor to any prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier who is to supply the services, system or major components thereof for any project where the Contractor has provided or is providing support as described in FAR 9.5.<br><br>(c) The Contracting Officer may make a determination to allow a Contractor to participate in an acquisition subject to the submission of an acceptable mitigation plan in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) below. This determination may not be appealed.<br><br>(1) If the Contracting Officer requests, and the Contractor submits an organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan that, after Government review is acceptable to the Government, the Contractor's parent corporation, subsidiaries, or other physically separate profit and loss centers may not be precluded from acting as a subcontractor or consultant on future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts. The Government's determination regarding the adequacy of the mitigation plan or the possibility of mitigation are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government and are not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract. The Government may terminate the contract for default if the Contractor fails to implement and follow the procedures contained in any approved mitigation plan.<br><br>(2) Any mitigation plan shall include, at a minimum, non-disclosure agreements to be executed by the Contractor and the Contractors employees supporting the Government per paragraph (c) above. Items for consideration in a mitigation plan include the following: identification of the organizational conflict(s) of interest; reporting and tracking system; an organizational conflict of interest  compliance/enforcement plan, to include employee training and sanctions, in the event of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information; a plan for organizational segregation (e.g., separate reporting chains); and data security measures.<br><br>(d) These restrictions outlined in paragraph (b) shall apply to   - FILL IN --.  This clause shall remain in effect for one year after completion of this contract.<br><br>(e) The Contractor shall apply this clause to any subcontractors or consultants, who have access to information, participate in the development of data, or participate in any other activity related to this contract which is subject to terms of this clause at the prime contractor level, unless the Contractor includes an acceptable alternate subcontractor provision in its mitigation plan. For subcontractors or consultants under this contract, if an organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan is submitted and acceptable to the Government, the subcontractor's parent corporation, subsidiaries, or other physically separate profit and loss centers may not be precluded from acting as a prime, subcontractor, or consultant on future CECOM LCMC Acquisition Center contracts.<br><br>(f) The Contractor's employees shall be trained and informed of Subpart 9.5 of the FAR and this contract provision, and shall execute a Contractor-Employee Personal Financial Interest/Protection of Sensitive Information Agreement as appropriate.<br><br>(g) The Contactor agrees that it will use all reasonable diligence in protecting proprietary data received by it. The Contractor further agrees it will not willfully disclose proprietary data to unauthorized parties without the prior permission of the Government, and that proprietary data shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed, in whole or part, for any purpose other than to accomplish the contracted effort. This restriction does not limit the contractors right to use, duplicate or disclose such information if such information was lawfully obtained by the contractor from other sources.<br>  <br>(h) The Contractor agrees to enter into written agreements with all companies whose proprietary data it shall have access and to protect such data from unauthorized use or disclosure as long as it remains proprietary. The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer copies of these written agreements.

<DESC>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 25 March 2011.<br><br>Q1.  Do you have any news on the anticipated DRAFT RFP release of the Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems opportunity?<br><br>A1.  The anticipated release date for the DRAFT RFP has not yet been determined.  A DRAFT of sections L&M and the Past Performance Questionnaire were posted to Army Single Face to Industry and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.<br><br>Q2.  Draft PWS Paragraph 4.1.1, Task Area 1 - Development: this paragraph indicates that work will be development work and will be performed by the system development contractor. Would task orders issued under this Task Area be considered exempt from the OCI Provisions in the contract pursuant to FAR 9.505-2(a)(3)?<br><br>A2. No<br><br>Q3.  Will that exemption be identified in individual RTEPs and awarded Task Orders?<br><br>A3. No<br><br>Q4.  Does the information technology requirement for this program (solicitation # W15P7T11RC001) include secure remote connectivity and/or secure file transfer capabilities between Windows based servers and other Windows and non Windows clients/devices.<br><br>A4.  The Government has a requirement to transmit and receive information up to and including the Secret level. The Design, Execution and Implementation of that requirement will be a function of the individual offeror's proposal.  The Government is providing no further guidance on this topic as it wants to encourage creative solutions that bring additional value to each offeror's proposal.<br><br>Q5.  Has a decision been made on what specific contracting vehicle PEO C3T will use for these IDIQs?<br><br>A5.  Please refer to Section 3.1, Contract Type, of the DRAFT PWS posted on18 Jan 2011.<br><br>Q6.   Is the anticipated final RFP timeframe still the second quarter of 2011?<br><br>A6.  Yes<br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND (C4ISR)<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>Answers to Question from Industry, SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following answers are in response to questions from industry received as of 06 May 2011.<br><br>Q1.  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), will the Government provide that contractor a fair opportunity to bid the low rate/full rate production work should a requirement exist for that production work? <br><br>A1.  How the Government will solicit the Delivery Orders will be forthcoming in the RFP and will be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).<br>   <br>Q2.  Does the Government envision that this process could be streamlined by including all facets of the life cycle support in a single task order, particularly for ACAT programs?<br><br>A2.  The Government does not anticipate a single task order covering all aspects of the life cycle support of a system.  However, there may be extraordinary circumstances where a single task order covering all aspects of the life cycle support of a system is released.  Such a requirement will require the contracting officer approval and at this point the Government cannot predict the circumstances of such a release.<br><br>Q3.  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. . an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), can that contractor bid follow-on work that is a formal ACAT program (a new separate RFP, not GTACS related) where the performance requirements of the system to be designed and produced were proven to be feasible in the prototype system developed under GTACS?<br><br>A3.  The Government cannot answer this question as it relates to future contract opportunities not related to this solicitation.<br>   <br>Q4.  In this case the GTACS prime should be able to avoid work that creates elements of the new ACAT program RFP - SOW, CLIN structure, test strategy, etc.  Again, will the Government use a set of SETA contractors to develop any / all procurement data packages for these scenarios?<br><br>A4.  Please Clarify<br><br>Q5.  I am looking for the whole draft solicitation for GTACS W15P7T11RC001; I only get sections L and M.<br><br>A5.  Please refer to Answer 1 posted to FedBizOpps on 28 March 2011.<br><br>Q6.  Can the Government provide guidance on how many Offeror past performances (e.g., minimum and maximum number) will be required?<br><br>A6.  Please refer to the DRAFT Sections L and M, Pg 4, first paragraph, (ii) Volume II-Past Performance (factor) posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.  Updates to DRAFT Sections Land M will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q7.  If an Offeror proposes with major subcontractors, can the Government provide guidance on how many major subcontractor past performances (e.g., minimum and maximum number) will be required?<br><br>A7.  Please refer to the DRAFT Sections L and M, Pg 6, [2], (c), posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) and FedBizOpps on 25 March 2011.  Updates to DRAFT Sections Land M will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q8.  Draft Sec. L.2.c.ii.e Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire indicates that the Questionnaire is to be returned to the Offeror for inclusion with the proposal. On the last page of the Questionnaire the respondent is instructed to return the completed Questionnaire to the Contracting Officer. Can the Government please clarify the instructions regarding respondents' return of completed Questionnaires?<br><br>A8.  Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire(s) are to be returned first from the POC to the Offeror for inclusion with the proposal.  Proposals will then be submitted at the appropriate RFP closing date.  Updates to the Draft Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire will be posted to ASFI and FedBizOpps as they become available.<br><br>Q9.  For work performed as a subcontractor, we have found that the Government contracting officer / COR / COTR are often unwilling to provide past performance responses for a subcontractor. For work performed as a subcontractor, will the Government allow the Offeror to request Questionnaires be completed by the prime contractor's POC and by the prime contractor's technical representative (often a project or program manager)?<br><br>A9.  Yes<br><br>Q10.  Can the Government advise when they anticipate issuing attachment 4 for pricing purposes?<br><br>A10.  The Government does not intend to release a draft version of attachment 4.  The attachments will be released with the final RFP.<br><br>Q11.  Is there an incumbent contract and if so, what is the contract number?<br><br>A11.  No<br><br>Q12.  Should I expect a Q&A document to be released with this information in the future, or should I not expect an answer?<br><br>A12.  Yes, all questions from industry will be posted to FedBizOpps.<br><br>Q13.  What date do you have set for the Industry Date?<br><br>A13.  At this time, the Government has no plans for another Industry day.<br><br>Q14.  The ASFI (Response Deadline) and the FBO.gov (Response Date) have different dates. The ASFI shows 5/5/2011 and the FBO.gov shows 5/12/2011. Which is the proper due date?<br><br>A14.  The proper date is 12 May 2011.<br><br>Q15.  What do the response date citations refer to as the material that is due?<br><br>A15.  The date listed as a response date is for system purposes only.  The synopsis is an informational notice and there is no required response at this time.<br><br>Q16.  The 4/21/2011 Synopsis notice at FBO.gov states "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted."  This suggests that the Government will make no material or significant change in the final RFP as compared to what is already published for the solicitation as of 4/21/2011. Is that an accurate assumption on which one can base an early submission of proposal?<br><br>A16. No, that is not an accurate assumption.  The posted Sections L and M are drafts, as identified in the document.  The final RFP is forthcoming.<br><br>Q17.  Is it possible to schedule an in-person demonstration of our technology to those involved and/or responsible for this pre-solicitation?<br><br>A17.  Please refer to Q10 and A10 posted to FedBizOpps 06 January 2011.<br><br>Q18.  What specific information/materials, and in what format, can be deliver now to you and/or those responsible for this pre-solicitation?<br><br>A18.  Questions may be forwarded by e-mail to the points of contact listed below.<br><br>Q19.  Do we need to be on the GSA or have an existing government contract to participate in this solicitation?<br><br>A19.  No<br><br>Q20.  If schedule an in-person demonstration of our technology is unfeasible, how can we arrange for no-cost on-line brief demo of our product to interested government technical representatives?<br><br>A20.  Please refer to Q10 and A10 posted to FedBizOpps 06 January 2011.<br><br>Q 21 In accordance with the statement included in the posting of April 21, 2011 please clarify if the Government is requesting and accepting early submission of proposals and information at this time; and in advance of the issuance of the final solicitation and task orders.<br><br>A21. The Government is not accepting proposals at this time and will only accept proposals once the final RFP has been issued.<br><br>Q22.  The statement included in this posting "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted." implies the opportunity is available for the industry to submit proposals, capability statements, and information under this requirement which may be included and evaluated at the time of the final solicitation.<br><br>A22.  The Government is not accepting proposals at this time and will only accept proposals once the final RFP has been issued.<br><br><br>Q23. Our company submitted its response to your Request for Information (RFI) on January 1, 2011.  Please advise if additional information is desired and requested at this time.<br><br>A23. Additional information is not required at this point in time.<br><br>Q 24. In cases where a subcontractor on a GTACS Team is based out of Canada and has a subsidiary created for the purposes of conducting business with the U.S.  Government, where the subcontractor's rates and cost build-up formulas are typically audited by the Canadian Commercial Corp. (CCC) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), will the requirement for submission of that subcontractor's proprietary cost information "sealed data" through an Army web site be waived, and normal CCC submission of the proprietary data be acceptable.<br><br>A 24.  The contractor's forward pricing rate proposal, disclosed practices, and proposal methodology for the GTACS effort should be consistent.    <br><br>Q 25. Please advise if the Government is planning to provide responses to all the questions submitted to date under this effort.<br>A25. The Government does plan to respond to all industry questions.<br><br>Q26. Does the Government plan to issue a pipeline of the RTEPs planned for release to include Scope of Work, location and anticipated release date after award of the IDIQ vehicle?<br>A26. The Government plans to award many Delivery and Task Orders under this contract over the next 5 years. <br><br>Q27. Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?<br>A27. Depending on the requirements for individual DO/TOs issued under the GTACS contract, the Offeror will have the ability to make site visits.<br><br>Q28. We would like to respond to this draft solicitation; however the three task orders are not listed.  Could you possibly allow us to view the complete solicitation with the sample task orders or direct us to a location to view them? <br>A28. The sample tasks will be part of the final RFP.<br><br>Q29.I wanted to follow up with a request for a possible schedule; and the timeline you are planning to post responses to questions submitted to date on the GTACS effort.<br>A29.  Question will be responded to as they are submitted and as the answers are available.<br><br>Q30. Reference:  PWS Section 3.6 Personnel - The Contractor shall provide personnel having security clearances up to TOP SECRET, or as identified in applicable DO/TO.  Will the Government consider revising requirement to TS-SCI in order to broaden the contract to allow TS-SCI efforts to be competed under the contract.<br>A30.  The contracting officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information. <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND <br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The following are responses to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of May 13, 2011, 1500 Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a)  - " The Offeror shall submit a Microsoft 2007 Excel file (workbook) that calculates and includes the formulas necessary to develop a summary worksheet (single tab within workbook) which provides the 'Summary of Total Price by Cost Element by CLIN by WBS'." <br><br>Does the Government intend to provide an Excel 2007 workbook with the final RFP that is formatted in the manner that the Government wishes to receive the Cost/Pricing data as described in this section?<br><br>R1: YES<br><br>Q2: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a)  - "..This 'Summary of Total Price by Cost  Element by CLIN by WBS' worksheet will have for each Cost Element a reference to a worksheet (single tab within workbook) containing the supporting calculations, formulas, and line item details necessary for the government to evaluate the individual components of the Cost Element by CLIN by Fiscal Year and by WBS. (See Attachment 4 - workbook)<br><br>Will the Government provide the referenced workbook in Attachment 4 with the Final RFP?  <br><br>R2: YES<br><br>Q3: If so, does this workbook include detail worksheet and structure for each Cost Element as requested in the referenced paragraph?  <br><br>R3: YES<br><br>Q4: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a) ii. Direct Material (2nd paragraph) - "Each priced summary will include the part number once with the total proposed number of units for the WBS". <br><br>Will the Government please explain the requirement to "...include the part number once"?  Is the Government expecting a single part number for each level of the WBS, of which the required part will be defined in the Final RFP?  Or does the Government want a collapsed Bill of Materials by Part Number with quantities of each for each level of the WBS?<br><br>R4: The Government requires a collapsed Bill of Materials by Part Number with quantities of each for each level of the WBS.<br><br>Q5: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(a) v. Indirect Costs - "...For each Indirect Cost (example Fringe, Overhead, Material/Subcontract Handling, General and Administrative, Facilities Capital Cost of Money, etc.,) identify the indirect rates from your Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) or forward Pricing Rate Proposal (FPRP) applied to each respective Cost Element that were used to calculate the Indirect Costs."<br><br>Will the Government accept a Forward Pricing Rate Proposal that defines Activity Rates (not separated into overhead, fringe, etc.) as an adequate submission for this requirement?<br><br>R5: No, the Government requires the offeror to propose indirect rates on an individual basis.  <br><br>Q6: Draft Section L (2)(c)(iii)(d) - " The offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the Excel files detailed in paragraphs A, B, and C. NO PRICE DATA (RATES/SUMMARY DOLLARS) shall be included in the SANITIZED Files."<br><br>Will the Government please provide more detail on the data that will need to be excluded in the "sanitized" version?  <br><br>R6: All monetary values must be excluded.<br><br>Q7: Will the Government please provide detail of what data should be included in the sanitized files?<br><br>R7:  Everything excluding all monetary values. <br><br>Q8: Reference page 3, Table 1.  We assume there will be one (1) file for the Technical Volume that will contain:<br><br>Table of Contents for all information in the Technical Volume including Sample Task 1, 2, and 3 and not a separate Table of Contents for each.  Is this correct? <br><br>R8: YES<br><br>Q9: Will attachments such as Block Diagrams, Equipment Specification Sheets, be counted in the page count?<br><br>R9:  Any information the Offeror feels necessary to accurately describe its response to the final RFP should be included and all information will be considered as part of the page count. <br><br>Q10: Reference page 3, Paragraph 2, Page Count.  How will the number of lines per page be determined? Word will indicate line numbers: however, spaces are counted as well. Draft Section L, 2 Proposal Files, b, page 3<br><br>R10: The Government will use Word format to count the number of lines. Draft section L 2. Proposal files, paragraph 2 defines the amount of spacing to be provided and only TEXT will be removed.<br><br>Q11: Will the table of contents be included as part of the page count for the Technical and Past Performance Volumes?  Will a cover page and other informational list (list of figures, list of tables, list of acronyms, etc.) count in the total number of allowed pages?<br><br>R11:  The table of contents does not count as part of the page count<br>Lists of figure, tables and acronyms do not count as part of the page count.<br><br>Q12: Draft Section L, (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6<br>The Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires are to be included in the proposal Past Performance file.  Will these pages count in the total number of allowed pages?<br><br>R12: Per Draft Section L (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6, the completed questionnaires will not be counted as part of the total page count.  In addition the Questionnaires will no longer be the Offerors responsibility.<br><br>Q13:  Regarding OCI, can a prime bidder exclude itself from individual RTEPs/Task Orders if it feels there would be a conflict of interest on that particular Task Order?<br><br>R13: Yes<br><br>Q14:  Small Business Participation Plan.  Is a Small Business Participation Plan to be submitted only for each of the Sample Tasks or is a Small Business Participation Plan also required for the overall IDIQ total effort?  If also required for the total IDIQ effort what values should be used for plan figures.  The same questions also arise for large businesses required to also submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan.<br><br>R14:   The SB plan is for the overall effort - not for each individual Sample Task.<br><br>Q15:  Pricing.  Your instruction is for offerors to submit "Cost, Cost Plus, and Firm-Fixed Prices for its proposed notional systems/equipment in response to the three Sample Tasks provided with the RFP".  Is this to be understood as requiring three proposals for each of the Sample Tasks or will each task have a specified contract type associated with it?<br><br>R15:  No, only one proposal is to be submitted. There will be only one type of contract for each sample task which will be provided in the final RFP. <br><br>Q16: Pricing.  Is it acceptable to submit a Word document Price Volume along with the Excel spreadsheet which contains the requested supporting information? Can the Word document submission include printouts of the pricing file worksheets to accompany explanations of the basis used to develop the pricing?  Is a sanitized version of the Word document Volume desired along with the sanitized Excel spreadsheet?<br><br>R16: No- see pricing proposal instructions provided in the draft  L&M , in addition a sanitized version of all submittals must be provided. <br><br>Q17: Pricing. The instructions refer to preparing pricing for each Cost Element by Fiscal Year.  Is the fiscal year being referred here the Government fiscal year or the offeror's fiscal year?<br><br>R17: For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure  (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed.<br><br>Q18: Reference: draft M.C.3.b explains how the total evaluated price shall be calculated by multiplying the evaluated proposed price for each Sample Task by a weighted multiplier.  It also states "Based on historical data and future projections for task orders over the life of the base contract, each multiplier represents the relative contribution of the work in each Sample Task to the overall effort."<br><br>The multiplier for STO3 is .20, which indicates that historical data and future projections for Sustainment are set at 20% of the total effort.  However, in the Q&A released on 16 February 2011, the Government stated:<br><br>Q/C52. What is the expected mix of Material Purchase vs. Services provided? During Industry day in July 2010, the KO had announced a 60% Material and a 40% Services mix. Will this stay the same of some other anticipated mix?<br> <br>R18: The mix and percentages will be clarified as part of the final RFP.<br><br>Q19: Recommend that the government adjust the STO 3 multiplier to .30 and reduce the multipliers for STO 1 and/or STO 2 to more accurately reflect the anticipated 70%-30% mix of Material and Service.<br><br>R19: The contracting officer will take this under consideration. <br><br>Q20: Volume I Technical<br>1.) Reference: Draft PWS (released 14 January 2011) Section 3.14.3 states "Unless otherwise specified by the Government, the TEP size shall not exceed twenty (20) total text pages."  However, the table in Draft L Section 2.b shows a 30 page limit for STO 1, 25 pages per STO 2, and 25 pages for STO 3.<br>Question: Please confirm that the government is requesting a 20 page TEP for each STO.  And if so, what information should be included in the 10 additional pages for STO 1 and 5 additional pages for STO 2 and STO 3?<br><br>R20: Refer to Draft Section L proposal submission instructions table 2<br><br>Q21: Reference: Draft L.2.c Part (i) VOLUME I - TECHNICAL states "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3." Question: Please clarify if a separate Executive Summary is required for each Sample Task response.<br><br>R21: A single Executive Summary shall be provided addressing brief overview of the entire proposal to include the Sample Tasks.   Executive Summary section is included as part of the overall page count.<br><br>Q22: Volume II Past Performance<br>1.) Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "For all contracts identified in Section 1, Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires must be completed and submitted with the Offeror's proposal submission."<br>Question: Please confirm that the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires do not count toward the total page limitation as specified for Volume II (Past Performance) per section L?<br><br>R22:  Per draft section L (ii) Volume II - Past Performance, (e), page 6, the completed questionnaires will not be counted as part of the total page count.  In addition the Questionnaires will no longer be the Offerors responsibility.<br><br>Q23: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation."<br>Question: Will the government consider a page limit applied per reference (Section 1 & 2) to help ensure a more consistent evaluation of references between all offerors?  (Note that, by itself, the 50 page limit for Volume II may result in reference descriptions of different lengths, depending on how many references an offeror submits.)<br><br>R23: The Government Contracting Officer will take this recommendation under consideration.<br><br>Q24: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (ii) VOLUME II - PAST PERFORMANCE states "Relevancy is defined as those development, production and sustainment tasks defined in the PWS and sample tasks attached to the RFP include efforts similar in complexity and technology to the GTACS Contract."<br>Question: This definition of relevancy is not clear.  We suggest the government rephrase to "Relevancy is defined as similar in scope to the tasks defined in the PWS and sample tasks attached to the RFP, and similar in complexity and technology to the GTACS Contract."<br><br>R24: The definition of Relevancy will be revised in the final RFP to make it clearer.<br><br>Q25: Volume III Small Business Participation Plan<br>1.) Reference: In accordance with DFARS 215.304, both large and small businesses are required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan.  As such, draft section L requires Offerors to include "Business Development (BD) Program" companies in their SBPP.<br>Question: Please confirm that the "Business Development (BD) Program" referenced in Draft Section L is the same as the 8(a) program referenced in Draft Section M.<br><br>R25: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP. <br><br>Q26:  Reference: Draft L.2.c part (iv) - VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN includes a matrix to propose Small Business Participation Goals.<br>Question: What is the government's definition of "Total Contract Value" as it relates to completing this matrix?<br><br>R26: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP.<br><br>Q27: Reference: Draft L.2.c part (iv) - VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN includes a separate matrix to demonstrate HBCU/MI target participation.<br>Question: Please confirm the Government's intent to require the utilization of HBCU/MI organizations as part of the offeror's Small Business Participation Plan per draft section L. And if so, how will they be evaluated since they are not currently mentioned in Draft Section M?<br><br>R27: Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP.<br><br>Q28: Reference:  Draft Section L.2.c(ii) VOLUME II-PAST PERFORMANCE (FACTOR)<br><br>Question:  Please clarify the requirement for the "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. <br><br>Does the Government intend for offeror's to submit all their contracts, which will be hundreds, or does the Government intend to request three - five of the most relevant?  <br><br>R28: There are no limits to the number of contracts that can be submitted; However the Offeror should use their best judgment with regards to recent and relevant data.<br><br>Q29: Will teaming partners/subcontractors be required to submit all their contracts within three years?<br><br>R29: Refer to submission instruction in draft Section L<br><br>Q30: Will past performance questionnaires be required for all submitted past performance references?<br><br>R30: The collection of Past performance questionnaires will now be the responsibility of the Government in the final RFP. <br><br>Q31: The government has requested that the Cost/Proposal in "Volume IV - Cost-Price (Factor)" be provided in the form of a Microsoft 2007 Excel file which shall include the detail data and calculations building to the submitted pricing.  In lieu of a Microsoft 2007 Excel file, will the government consider submission of the Cost Element supporting data and calculations in the form of reporting from an industry standard government costing and pricing software tool such as ProPricer which utilizes source data (including indirect rates) that tie to an Offeror's FPRP (and which such reporting has historically been used and relied upon by DCAA), rather than requiring the development and use of a manual Excel model that would be both less efficient and allow for more potential for human error?<br><br>R31: The Offer shall utilize the spread sheets provided by the government. <br><br>Q32: Will the workbook referred to as "Attachment 4-workbook" be required to be used for the Offeror's submission to the government, and if so, will it be provided to potential Offerors prior to the release of the RFP in order for the prospective Offerors to prepare to best administer their proposal efforts towards completion of the workbook in the format of such workbook?<br><br>R32: The workbook will be released with the final RFP.<br><br>Q33: Request clarification on the organization of the Past Performance volume.  Does each contract submitted for past performance contain a Section 1 & 2 (meaning Section 1 & 2 repeat for each past performance contract), or is there only one Section 1 and one Section 2 that respectively contain Contract Description and Performance information for all relevant contracts?<br><br>R33: Each contract shall have its own section 1&2<br><br>Q34: Ref Section Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) - A "major subcontractor" is one that performs "more than 20% of the total proposed price".  Please confirm the "total proposed price" is the summation of the proposed prices for each Sample Task, not the total evaluated price or contract value.  <br><br>R34: Total proposed price will be utilized.<br><br>Q35: Ref Section Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) - Is the outline of work assignments (provided in Section 3) limited to subcontractors that perform more than 20% of the total proposed price, or does it include all proposed subcontractors?  Are the work assignments limited to the Sample Tasks or do they cover the entire contract PWS scope?<br><br>R35: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q36: Please confirm that all proposed subcontractors performing less than 20% of the total proposed price are not required to submit past performance, or questionnaires.<br><br>R36: That is correct<br><br>Q37: Draft Section L.2.c(ii)(e) states that Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires are to be completed (Parts I and II) and returned to the Offeror for inclusion in their proposal.  However, Part III in the Questionnaire requires the completed document be returned to the Contracting Officer in the cover letter.  Please clarify how completed questionnaires will be submitted to the GTACS source selection team.  Typically, completed questionnaires are not returned to the Offeror.  <br><br>R37: The questionnaires will be returned to the Contracting Officer or specialist as will be stated in the final RFP.<br> <br>Q38: Please clarify the correct title of Volume II - is it Past Performance Risk, Past Performance (Factor) or Past Performance?  <br><br>R38: Past Performance<br><br>Q39: In reference to Draft Section L & M, Page 4 - (ii) Volume II - Past Performance (Factor), we view a discrepancy between the definition of "relevancy" and the page limit of 50 pages.  Will the Government please clarify that the Offeror will be allowed to determine which of its contracts and which of its Major Subcontractor's contracts are relevant to this effort in light of a limited page count?<br><br>R39: Please refer to R28.<br><br>Q40: In reference to Draft Section L & M, Page 13 - Cost Price (Factor) iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort - A listing of individual Subcontract/ Interdivisional Efforts (S/IE) identifying the company and its specific division or segment with its corresponding cost by Contractor Fiscal Year. Note: The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over.  In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data, will the Government please clarify which FAR Clause(s) are applicable here?  Will the Government please clarify if this reference includes commercial suppliers? <br><br>We view a discrepancy between the nature of the GTACS competition and FAR 15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing, which describes an exemption for providing cost and pricing data for COTS suppliers in occasions of adequate price competition.  Will the Government please clarify its intent?<br>FAR 15.403-1 Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing requires that the Prime Contractor provide Certified Pricing in order to flow that requirement down to Subcontractors.  Section L and M do not require the Prime to submit certified pricing.  Will the Government please clarify this request? <br><br>R40: For purposes of the evaluation of the source selection, no certified cost or pricing data will be required as part of an offeror's submission, however, the Government reserves the right to request 'other than cost and pricing data' if required at either the evaluation of sample tasks or during evaluation of future DO/TOs.<br><br>Q41: In Draft Section L & M, Page 19 - c. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Performance Risk - Will the Government please provide referenced Section IV?<br><br>R41: This reference has been deleted from the final RFP.   <br><br>Q42: In Draft Section L & M, Page 17 - PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION APPROACH <br>"A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing hardware, software or services those subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price."  If the Sample Task Order requires more that 20% of a vendor's COTS hardware, will that vendor then qualify as a "major subcontractor" and will the Government require Past Performance from that vendor in the Past Performance volume?  Or will the Offeror be able to treat said vendor as a commercial component supplier?  <br><br>R42: The vendor is considered a major subcontractor and will be required to provide Past Performance data.<br><br>Q43: Will the Government require certified pricing from that vendor if the total dollar amount is over $700K?  <br><br>R43: Please refer to R40.<br><br>Q44: Draft L.2b, "File Packaging"; p3<br>Question/Comment:  <br>There appears to be a disconnect between the Sample Task response format preparation instruction in Draft Section L and the Task Execution Plan (TEP) contents defined in the Draft PWS in paragraph 3.14.3 (and its two sub-paragraphs 3.14.3.1, 3.14.3.2, and 3.14.3).  Please clarify.<br><br>R44: For the RFP follow the instructions in Sections L&M.  For future DOs/TOs follow the instructions as outlined in the PWS.    <br><br>Q45: Draft L.2c (iv), VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR); p7<br>Question/Comment:  <br>Will the Government recognize and give credit to a Prime's subcontracting to its SDB Partners who are not 8(a) Business Development Program participants as expressed in its Small Business Subcontracting Participation Plan?	<br>Rationale: Restricting small business participation credit to 8a Business Development Program small businesses ignores the larger community of Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB).   The current wording implies the SDB category at the top level are not counted.<br><br>R45: Yes, the Government will recognize and gave credit to a Prime's subcontracting to its SDB partners who are not 8(a) Business Development Program participants.  <br><br>Q46: Draft L.2c, "Content Requirements"; p3<br>Question/Comment:	<br>Please state if the "Summary Section" of the proposal files is the same as the summaries defined under 3.14.3 in the draft PWS released in January, 2011.  <br>Rationale: This will help us understand more fully what information is requested by the Government by this part of Section L.<br><br>R46:   Please refer to R21.<br>  <br>Q47: Draft L.2c(ii)(c), "Section 3 - Subcontracts"; page 6<br>Question/Comment:<br>Within the Section L Past Performance volume and the Section M Past Performance Evaluation, we recommend that the government clarify the definition of Major Subcontractor (>20%) to be based upon the price of each Sample Task taken alone, as opposed to the sum of the three (3) Sample Tasks price taken together.  We want to avoid a situation that is too restrictive.  For example, a subcontractor performing >20% of effort on Sample Task #1 may not be >20% of the total price for three Sample Tasks combined.  <br>Rationale:<br>With three disparate sample tasks, it is possible that individual Major Subcontractors would not have a high level of proficiency for all three task areas.  If bound to (>20%) for a given Major Subcontractor as a sum of the three Sample Tasks, the Prime Contractor would be limited on the number of Major Subcontractors included in the Sample Task responses, which would limit who the prime contractor can use for Past Performance citations.  If prime contractors have to weigh the value of a subcontractor's past performance against the best technical solution for each sample task, the unintended consequence to the Government could result in responses that do not deliver the Best Value solution that is desired.<br><br>R47:  The Government Contracting Officer will take this recommendation under consideration. <br><br>Q48:  Draft L.2c (iv)(b), "Table entry row F"; p9<br>Question/Comment:<br>The emphasis on HBCU/MI subcontracting in Section L seems disconnected from the intent of the small business goals under the GTACS PWS/RFP.<br>Rationale:<br>College/University participation typically involves basic science research and technology development. The GTACS three task areas of system Development, Production & Deployment and Sustainment typically do not require College/University participation.   <br><br>R48: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration. <br><br>Q49: Question/Comment:<br>The ability of an Offeror's team (total composition) to adequately cover the breadth of tasking in the PWS does not appear to be a consideration.  Section M as currently written only evaluates the team composition on the Sample Tasks.  While the final team composition may have no direct bearing on the sample tasks, an Offeror needs to be responsive to the PWS elements.  It is suggested that a team assessment matrix similar to that below be considered as part of the offering.<br>Rationale:<br>The GTACS PWS paragraph 1.0 "Scope" emphasizes the requirement for the Prime and his Team to address all Hardware, Systems and Services aspects defined in PWS paragraphs 4.1 through 4.5.   <br><br>Table x.  PWS Capability Matrix<br>PWS Category - GTACS Prime - GTACS Partners<br><br>R49: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q50: Draft L.2c (iv)(b), "Small Business Participation Goals"; p7-9<br>Question/Comment:<br>On page 7 in 3rd paragraph under (b), the letter designations used in the narrative do not match the letter designations in the table. 	<br>Rationale:<br>Questions in the final RFP will be reduced if this minor clerical error is rectified. <br><br>R50: In the final RFP, the matrix will be deleted, and will be replaced with clear instructions on the Small Business Participation Plan.<br><br> Q51: Draft L.2c(iv)(d), "HBCU/MI Target Participation"; p11<br>Question/Comment:<br>NAICS Codes are only requested for HBCU/MI subcontractors and not the rest of the small business sub-categories.   NAICS Codes for all Team Partners should be of interest to the Government so that the proposal evaluators know that a Prime Offeror is working with small businesses with GTACS relevant NAICS Codes to perform work under this contract.<br><br>R51: In the final RFP, participation breakout by NAICS will be required for all Small Business Sub-Categories.<br><br>Q52: Draft L.2c(iii), VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR); p3, 12 & 14<br>Question/Comment:<br>Similar RFPs in the past have included a template for a cost file that had a defined template.  Will the government define a template for bidders to complete for the cost volume?  <br>Should there also be a filename entitled "Cost.xlsx" or even a series of filenames ending in .xlsx for the three separate cost spreadsheets referenced as (a), (b), and (c) above?<br>Rationale:<br>In iii VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR) in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (d), it is required to be submitted in Microsoft 2007 Excel files in the proposal.  However, in Proposal Files in Table 1 for the Volume IV Price, it states the file name is to be Cost.doc.<br><br> R52: A template will be provided.<br><br>Q53: Question/Comment:<br>A review of the suggested proposal volumes does not appear to adequately consider or evaluate an Offeror's ability to manage a diverse team and effectively deliver solutions on the Task Orders.  A  "Management" volume or section would allow discussion of Program Management activities, contract management, execution management and overall subcontract management and  provide the Government with additional insight and will reduce contract risk by eliminating "surprises"- i.e., execution impacts in cost and schedule that are otherwise unforeseen or unreported until they become issues.<br>Rationale:<br>Management of the contract and individual task orders including schedule and cost status are important aspects to consider when choosing a contractor.<br><br>R53: The contracting officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q54:  Draft L.2c(i)," Content Requirements, Tech Volume"; p3,4	<br>Question/Comment:<br>Draft Sections L&M do not appear to give relevance to, or generally track with, the Draft PWS.  In one example, the TEP Summaries under 3.14.3 of the Draft PWS suggest that bidders include price but the Draft L&M state that Vol I shall not include any price data.  Please clarify. <br><br>R54:  The exclusion of price/cost information from other parts of the Offeror's proposal is to maintain the integrity of the technical evaluation. Subsequent to the initial contract award, the TEPs will follow the general preparation instructions set forth in the PWS with detailed information contained in each RTEP.  Please refer to R44.  <br><br>Q55:  Draft L.2c(iv), "VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR)";  p7<br>Question/Comment:<br>The current descriptions and evaluation criteria only appear to give consideration to the Small Business partners identified and incorporated into the Sample Task responses (non-awarded).  It is suggested that insight into an Offer's team composition would benefit the Government by demonstrating the Offer's commitment to small businesses on their GTACS Team who are not participating in any of the three (3) Sample Tasks.<br>Rationale:<br>Full team composition for executing an IDIQ contract can be an important factor in determining who can offer the best solutions.<br><br>R55:  Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) will be evaluated separately from sample tasks.  SBPP must address team composition and the team make up to ensure full understanding of the total scope of the effort, to including enforceable commitment.  <br><br>Q56:  Draft L. (iv) VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN (FACTOR); p11 and SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS; C. EVALUATION APPROACH; 4.  SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN EVALUATION APPROACH.  P19<br>Question/Comment:<br>We request the government eliminate the term "enforceable commitment" and eliminate the additional weighting given to "enforceable commitment".  <br>Rationale:<br>As previously stated by the Government, each delivery order will be unique in nature.  As such, there is no way to know what requirements will be on future GTACS Task or Delivery Orders. Therefore, it is not possible to "commit" specific work share or scope to any sub-contractor.  If this was done, the prime contractor would be forced to propose Task or Delivery Order responses that might not provide the government with the best technical solution or the best value solution.  This also restricts fair competition within the prime contractor team.  The decision of which combination of small businesses will provide the best value solution to the government should be made based on the unique requirements of each Task or Delivery Order.<br><br>R56: The Government does not intend to eliminate the term "enforceable commitment, Enforceable commitment serves as a mean to ensure Small Business participation and as a deterrent from switching Small Business team members without the approval of the Contracting Officer and the Chief Associate Director of CECOM Small Business.<br><br>Q57: Please confirm that a winning prime will not be allowed to bring on additional sub-contractors following an award.<br><br>R57: The winning Prime will be allowed to bring additional Subcontractors on following the award. "The request for the replacement of a sub-contractor after contract award shall be formally made to the contracting officer in writing - along with accompanying rationale for replacement. <br><br>Q58: Will the Government accept MS Word 2007 (.docx) files?<br><br>R58: Yes<br><br>Q59: Please confirm that the pages required for the table of contents and summary section are excluded from the page limits provided for Volumes I and II.<br><br>R59: Table of contents is excluded however the Executive Summary section is included as part of the overall page count.<br><br>Q60:  Does the forty-five lines per page limitation apply to tables, for which the Government allows a reduced font size?<br><br>R60: Yes<br><br>Q61: Please confirm, for sections that are under the page limit but contain pages over 45 lines, that the sum of any additional lines will be moved to the back of the document and only removed if the document is then over the page limit.<br><br>R61: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q62: Page 6 Draft Sec L. (ii) VOLUME II (c) Section 3 - Subcontracts.  Offerors shall provide an outline of how the effort required by the solicitation will be assigned for performance within the Offeror's corporate entity and among the proposed subcontractors.  The information provided for the prime Offeror and each proposed major subcontractor must include the entire company name, company address, CAGE Code, DUNS Number and type of work to be performed by citing the applicable Government PWS paragraph number.  This includes all subcontractors who will be providing hardware or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price.<br>Comment: This requirement is written in the future tense.<br>Please confirm this requirement belongs in the past performance section.<br><br>R62: Confirmed<br><br>Q63: If this requirement does belong in the past performance section, can the Government confirm they will correct the tense so it properly addresses work already completed or ongoing?<br><br>R63: Yes<br><br>Q64: Please define the term "enforceable commitment."<br><br>R64:  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.  <br><br>Q65: Can the Government confirm that it expects a lack of competition on subsequent DO/TOs that will require certified cost or pricing data?<br><br>R65: The Government expects continued competition throughout the ordering period of this contract.<br><br>Q66: Will the system(s)/equipment within each of the three sample task areas will be the same or uniquely different?<br><br>R66: The Government does not intend to release details of the Sample Tasks prior to the final RFP.<br><br><br>Q67: This GTACS posting dated today, 5 April 2011, lists a response date of 5 May 2011.  Is this a valid response date for comments/ responses to the draft L&M or simply a "place holder" date?<br><br>R67: The date for responses closed 13 May 2011<br><br>Q68: Is GTACS scope limited to preclude work related to COTM/ BLOS Communications capabilities? <br><br>R68: No GTACS is designed to encompass all C3T communications requirements<br><br>Q69: Does the GTACS PMO not anticipate any future requirements for COTM/BLOS technology that is not already defined under an existing program? <br><br>R69: No, Sample task one in specific, is related to research and development of new communications systems.<br><br>Q70: Does the GTACS PMO not anticipate requirements for Airborne BLOS Communications under GTACS, where the technology is not currently scoped in whole or in part under another Army program? I.e.  COTM for Rotary wing aircraft? <br><br>R70: GTACS is broad enough in scope to encompass all C3T communications to include COTM and Rotary wing aircraft.<br><br>Q71: If an Army unit were to require new COTM/BLOS COMMS work performed under GTACS, would this be possible? <br><br>R71: Yes<br><br>Q72:  Has a time-frame for the Draft RFP release been determined yet?<br><br>R72: The date has not been established and a determination to release a draft RFP has not been made at this time.<br><br>Q73:  Reference Draft Section L, (ii) Volume II, (e) Past Performance:  Please confirm that the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires do not count toward the volume's page limit<br><br>R73: Refer to R22.<br><br>Q74: The government had earlier announced its intention to release a full Draft RFP (minus Sample Tasks) with the date as TBD.  Is it still the government's intention to release a full DRFP?<br><br>R74: Please refer to R72.<br> <br>Q75: Ref:   iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort -a listing of individual Subcontract/ Interdivisional Efforts (S/IE) identifying the company and its specific division or segment with its corresponding cost by Contractor Fiscal Year. Note: The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over.  In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data. <br><br>Question :  Current Draft Sections L and M do not appear to require the proposed prime to certify to cost or pricing data as this is a competitive procurement and 15.403-1(b)(4) would apply.  However, the language above appears to require subcontractors above $700,000 to provide certified cost or pricing data.  This appears to be an inconsistency.  Please clarify the Government's intent. <br><br>R75: Please refer to R40.  The following sentence will not be included in the final RFP, "In addition, current FAR guidance requires all sub/interdivisional work $700K and over to be certified cost or pricing data."<br><br>Q76:  If the Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort above should stand, please also consider the following:  The time required to obtain certified cost and pricing data will probably exceed the 30 day response time frame.  Pursuits that require the Offeror to obtain certified cost and pricing data often make that data due to the Government after proposal submission but before contract award to allow sufficient time for the effort involved.    Will the Government please consider revising the scope of this requirement or providing additional time for submission of this data?<br><br>R76: Please refer to R40.  This information will be reflected in the final RFP.<br><br>Q77:  Draft PWS Draft PWS Reference:  N/A<br><br>Question:  Will the government provide a Draft RFP prior to the release of the final RFP?<br><br>R77: See response to Q72<br><br>Q78:  Draft PWS Draft PWS Reference:  N/A<br><br>Question:  According to Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) the GTACS RFP is anticipated to be released 2QCY11.  Since we are half-way through the second quarter of this calendar year, does the Government anticipate the RFP release to be pushed into the third quarter of 2011?  If not will the RFP be issued in June?<br><br>R78:  See response to Q72<br><br>Q79:  The Draft Section L and M for the Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services Solicitation has been reviewed and we would like to request clarification on the following:  Since the contracting officer will take under consideration "...broaden the contract to allow TS-SCI efforts to be competed under the contract." (Q30 on 5/12/2011), will the Gov also consider receiving a classified submission as it relates to TS-SCI past Performance? <br><br>R79: The contracting office will take this under consideration<br><br>Q80:  The Gov response to Q/C's received as of 16 February 2011 responded to Q/C Q34, with A34 "Construction will not be part of this contract and all references will be removed from the PWS."  Recent response to industry for Q/C received as of 06 May 2011, Q27 Will IDIQ contract holders have the opportunity to make site visits prior to RTEP release, especially for efforts requiring construction?  The Gov response was A27. "Depending on the requirements for individual DO/TOs issued under the GTACS contract, the Offeror will have the ability to make site visits".  Does this mean construction will be part of the contract; therefore all references will not be removed from the PWS, as previously stated?<br><br>R80: Each delivery order will specify the requirements at the time of award.  There will be no Military construction under this contract however there may be a requirement to provide temporary facilities to support specific requirements. <br><br>Q81:  Comment: The Small Business Participation Plan requirement does not appear to be related to a multiple award contract with DO\TOs to follow but more akin to single award contracts and DO\TOs.<br>Recommendation: Consider reviewing as an example Sections L (Small Business Utilization) and M (Small Business Utilization Factor Evaluation Approach) related to of the DRFP for the Communications and Transmission Systems (CTS) solicitation.  Solicitation number W52P1J-11-R-0018. DRFP Can be found at http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/Sow.aspx.<br>Section L&M for CTS is a good example for a Small Business Participation Plan for a multiple award contract.<br><br>R81: The Contracting Officer will take this under consideration.<br><br>Q82:  There is no Management Volume.  Management risk is critical on this type of program. Suggest Government give offerors a 20 page volume to address organization structure, cost control, subcontractor management, hardware/software vendor management, EVM, reporting, Program Manager and key leads, production/manufacturing management processes, facilities, and ISO/CMMI status.  <br><br>R82: The Management information is contained in the Technical Volume.  <br><br>Q83: REF Page 3, Draft L.2.b May offerors provide a list of acronym definitions for each volume that is excluded from the page count limitations?<br><br>R83: Yes <br><br>Q84:  REF Page 3, Draft L.2.c Is there a page limit and any instructions for the "Summary Section" requested in each file per L.2.c? <br><br>R84:  Yes, Please refer to R21.  <br><br>Q85:  REF Page 4, Draft L.2.c (i) What is the page limit for the Technical Volume I Executive Summary?  Adequate space is required to provide an overview of the offeror's team structure, unique facilities, tools, and innovation that cannot be conveyed in 3 separate Sample Task responses.<br><br>R85:   Please refer to R21.<br>    <br>Q86:  Page 6, Draft L.2.c (ii)(c) Is the information in Paragraph (c) Section 3 - Subcontracts limited only to the prime contractor and major subcontractors whose subcontract is 20% more than the total proposed price?<br><br>R86: Total proposed price will be utilized<br><br>Q87:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(c) Page 6, Para (c) - Subcontracts -This section states  "This includes all subcontractors who will be providing hardware or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of the total proposed price."  Does this mean the total proposed price for the 3 Sample Tasks, OR for subcontractors that the prime envisions to have a minimum 20% participation across the life of the GTACS contract 5 year life?  The latter is recommended since key past performance should be tied to subcontractors' roles for total support; the Sample Tasks are not necessarily indicative of the prime contractor's overall team structure and subcontracting plan.  <br><br>R87: Please refer to R47. <br><br>Q88: REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(e) Paragraph (e) requests that offerors fill out part I of the PRAG questionnaire, give it to their reference points of contact, and have the points of contact return surveys back to the offeror for submission with the proposal. The PRAG form contradicts this instruction and requests that points of contact e-mail the survey directly to the GTACS contracting officer. Please clarify. Note - we recommend that points of contact e-mail surveys directly to the GTACS contracting officer.<br><br>R88: Please refer to R37<br><br>Q89:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c(ii)(e) PRAG Questionnaire If, as requested in paragraph (e), offerors will indeed be required to submit completed PRAG surveys with their proposals, we request that they be excluded from the page count. The PRAG form is 3 pages in length, and the Government has requested that the Contracting Activity and the Technical Representative for each referenced effort fill out a questionnaire. This will take up other valuable pages that will be important for the Government's evaluation. Please remove the questionnaires from page count considerations (if they are to be submitted with proposals).<br><br>R89: Please refer to R22<br><br>Q90:  REF Page 6, Draft L.2.c (iv) Is VOLUME III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN, to be listed as (iii)?<br><br>R90: Yes<br><br>Q91:  REF Page 7, Draft L.2.c(iv)(b) Subcontracting Goals (Para b, page 7) - is this profile based on the TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE?  If so, the Government needs to provide an estimated value for the total contract value.  If the total value is based on the 3 Sample Tasks, the total program subcontracting goals will be impossible to realistically calculate and portray (also reference Draft Section M, page 19, Para 4(f).<br><br>R91: The answer to this question will be posted at a later date. <br><br>Q92: REF Page 11, L.2.c(iv)(3)(a) Paragraph (3)(a) requires the Small Business Participation Plan to have  "Base your percentages on TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE."  Are we to use the grand total of the 3 Sample Tasks as TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE; or use the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) after the multipliers are applied as indicated on page 18 - Draft Section M.C.3.b.<br><br>R92: Total evaluated price<br><br>Q93:  REF Page 11, Draft L.2.c(iii) Page 11 states "The Offeror shall provide Cost, Cost Plus, and Firm-Fixed Prices for its proposed notional systems/equipment in response to the three Sample Tasks provided with the RFP".  Please advise if it is correct to assume only one of the procurement types indicated will be required for each task; and if the Government will specify the type of pricing desired for each separate task order?  <br><br>R93:  Only one contract type will be utilized per sample task.<br><br>Q94: REF Page 13, Draft L.2.c (iii)(a)iv VOLUME IV - COST PRICE - Section (iii)(a)iv: Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort:  Are we to include the interdivisional efforts as subcontracted dollars?]<br>	<br>R94: Yes, however, each prime shall propose IAW the Prime's disclosed practices.<br><br>Q95:  REF Page 16, Draft M.A  Paragraph M.A - Basis for Award, states, "Each RTEP will be competed amongst all Prime Contractors to the maximum extent practicable, and in accordance with the agreed upon Small Business Partial set-aside value of $3 Million threshold See section 4 below for additional detail." Section 4 provides no additional details of the $3 Million threshold. Please provide additional details.<br><br>R95: Section 4 reference will not be included in the final RFP.<br><br>Q96:  Para 3.14.12 - Small business - "All delivery/task orders below the $1 Million threshold that do not require development/ production/maintenance by an original equipment manufacturer or are otherwise restricted by proprietary requirements will be initially set-aside for small business awardees.  If after a three (3) day period two or more Small Business awardees indicate that they will not or cannot fulfill the requirement, it will then be solicited to all contract awardees regardless of size."  <br><br>Please clarify the Government's intent.  Are set-aside task orders only for efforts less than or equal to $1M, regardless of scope, i.e. the scope could address any aspect of the GTACS PWS?  Are all task orders valued over $1M, regardless of previous OEM involvement, to be solicited among all contract awardees?  <br><br>R96:  The partial set aside is $3M and could address any aspect of the GTACS PWS. Anything above that will be competed on a full and open competition.<br><br>Q97:  Does the Government intend to release a draft version of the full RFP, particularly Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria?<br><br>R97:  See response to Q72<br><br>Q98: In accordance with the statement included in the posting of April 21, 2011 please clarify if the Government is requesting and accepting early submission of proposals and information at this time; and in advance of the issuance of the final solicitation and task orders.  <br><br>The statement included in this posting "This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency when the final RFP is posted." implies the opportunity is available for the industry to submit proposals, capability statements, and information under this requirement which may be included and evaluated at the time of the final solicitation.  <br><br>Please advise if additional information is desired and requested at this time.<br><br>R98: No additional information is required<br><br>Q99:  In cases where a subcontractor on a GTACS Team is based out of Canada and has a subsidiary created for the purposes of conducting business with the U.S.  Government, where the subcontractor's rates and cost build-up formulas are typically audited by the Canadian Commercial Corp. (CCC) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), will the requirement for submission of that subcontractor's proprietary cost information "sealed data" through an Army web site be waived, and normal CCC submission of the proprietary data be acceptable.  <br><br>R99: No, the requirements for submission, under DOD policy and United States Law, by a foreign subsidiary will not be waived. <br><br>Q100:  If a GTACS task order requires a contractor to perform design trade-offs, develop and test a prototype system solution (e.g. an Engineering Development Model, or EDM), will the Government provide that contractor a fair opportunity to bid the low rate/full rate production work should a requirement exist for that production work?    It is recommended that the development of final drawings, specifications, and models that would form the basis of another GTACS task order which is production and sustainment of the approved final configuration/design be performed by PEO C3T's SETA contractor, which would avoid an OCI for the original EDM developer, which is in the best interest of the Army, since GTACS teams are being formulated to address the total set of PWS requirements, and that production of that EDM / prototype would be a natural continuation of life cycle support for the procurement of those system (s).  Does the Government envision that this process could be streamlined by including all facets of the life cycle support in a single task order, particularly for ACAT programs?<br><br>R100: Yes <br><br>Q101:  Please advise if the Government is planning to provide responses to all the questions submitted to date under this effort.<br><br>R101: Yes<br><br><br>All interested parties should continue to watch the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FEDBIZOPS) under the Solicitation # W15P7T-11-R-C001 for further information.  <br><br>Contracting Office: <br>U.S. ARMY CONTRACTING COMMAND<br>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND<br>6001Combat Drive, CCCE-CBC<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005-1846<br><br>Point(s) of Contact:<br>Mr. David Hansen, Contract Specialist                  Phone: 443-861-4988<br>E-mail: david.e.hansen1@us.army.mil<br>Mr. Stephen Jenniss, Contract Specialist               Phone: 443-861-4989<br>E-mail: stephen.jenniss@us.army.mil<br>Ms. Barbara Hansen, Contracting Officer/Group Chief    Phone: 443-861-5061<br>E-mail: barbara.ann.hansen@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>Response to Industry Questions for 06 July 2011 Draft Section L&M SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following are questions and responses 51 through 103 to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of 13 July 2011, 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q51.  Reference:  Page 8, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L Para iii 1 (e) List principal supplies/services to be subcontracted to. (e) Prior Performance Information:<br>Question:  "(e)" appears twice.  The first instance of (e) asks for a list of principal supplies/services. The second instance asks for "Prior Performance Information. Would the Government clarify whether both (e) paragraphs should be included?<br>R51.  This has been corrected<br><br>Q52.  Reference:  Page 10, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L (iv) VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR), iii. ODCs/Travel; -a priced summary of ODCs/Travel that includes a level of detail necessary for the Government to evaluate its components. <br> Question:  Is the price summary the bidder submits related to ODCs/Travel to be based on the Sample Task Orders or will the Government provide an estimated value for ODCs and travel?<br>R52. The price summary is based on the sample tasks.<br><br>Q53.  Reference:  Page 10 & 12, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L (iv) Volume IV-Cost-Price (Factors) Subsection iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort; Page 10 states "The prime contractor must provide  the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all S/IE costs $700K and over. However, subsection vii. Fee/Profit (d) (page 12) states that "The prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all sub/interdivisional costs $700K and over to include the selection and activities of your subcontractor(s)."  <br>Question:  Would the government clarify if the Prime contractor must provide or must have available the cost/price analysis for all costs over the FAR threshold of $700K?<br>R53.  The prime contractor must provide the cost/price analysis for all costs over the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) threshold, currently all S/IE costs $700K and over.<br><br>Q54.  Reference:  Page 11, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section L (iv) VOLUME IV - COST-PRICE (FACTOR); vii. Fee/Profit Provide the mathematical calculation of the proposed fixed fee/profit.  (b) Cost/Price Proposal (PRICING METHODOLOGY)  (c) Cost/Price Proposal (Sanitized Cost/Price Submission). The Offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the excel files detailed in paragraphs a, and b and C.<br>Question:  Section vii. Fee/Profit does not have a paragraph "(a)" although it appears paragraph "(c)" references it. Is "(a)" missing from the Draft L&M?<br>R54.  This correction has been made.<br><br>Q55.  Reference:  Page 17 and 18, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section M Para 4 b; On page 17,the  last paragraph before Table 1 CLIN List states "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract ... "  On page 18, Table 1 CLIN List, lines 3 and 4 state "CLIN 0001 (Fixed Price CLIN ) and "0002 (Cost Reimbursement CLIN)" are "For use on future Delivery/Task Orders."<br>Question:  Would the Government state which of two references to CLINs 0001 and 0002 the Offeror should use? Currently, definitions contradict each other.<br>R55. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q56.  Reference:  Page16, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section M Section 3 para. G; Note:  Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements.<br>Question:  What is the definition of the term "aggressive?" How will the term be measured?  What is the weight given to "additional credit?"<br>R56. This reference has been removed.<br><br>Q57.  Reference:  Section L Page 10 references Enclosure 05.<br>Question:  When will the government be providing the referenced enclosure? <br>R57. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q58.  Does the government anticipate requiring offers to submit labor rates for all labor categories at the IDIQ level? <br>R58. It is not necessary to submit labor rated for all labor categories.  However all Offeror labor categories must be mapped into the provided Government labor categories in accordance with Section L, Volume IV - Cost-Price factor.  <br><br>Q59.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 AND Section L, Section 2.c.(i) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." AND "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3. " Sample Task 1 allows an additional 5 pages in the response and typically an Executive Summary provides an overview of the Offeror's complete submission. Question:  Does the Government desire an Executive Summary (overview of the entire submission) in Volume 1 and an abstract (overview of the solution presented in the volume) in each Volume?" <br>R59. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q60.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(i), Page 4 "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3. "<br>Question:  Can the Government clarify what is meant by "above an executive summary?"<br>R60. A comma has been added between the word "above" and "an".<br><br>Q61.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." Typically an Executive Summary provides a high level overview of the Offeror's complete solution. <br>Question:  Can the Government please clarify the submission files that shall include an Executive Summary?<br>R61. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q62.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv), Page 9 The government makes reference to various workbooks and worksheets in Excel format within the section, linking and/or tying to other worksheets and workbooks. <br>Question:  Is the government providing these workbooks and worksheets fully formatted for the information that is being requested? Will the bidder be required to develop and create Excel files that meet all the requirements that the government has stated? Recommendation: A government provided base spreadsheet will provide a uniform format to simplify evaluation and provide a consistent basis of evaluation across Offeror submissions. <br>R62. The Government will provide the worksheet with the final RFP <br><br>Q63. Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv).(i) Direct Labor, Page 10 "The Labor rates shall be included on the "Rate" worksheet, the labor hours proposed per Government provided labor category shall correspond to the labor hours as detailed on the BOE worksheets" <br>Question:  Is the Government requiring the Basis of Estimates to be developed using the Governments' Labor Categories. Will the BOE format be provided by the government, or will each Offeror be allowed to submit their own format?<br>R63. The Government will provide a sample BOE template, but Offerors are permitted to utilize their own format as long as all of the required information is provided. Offerors will be required to map their labor category descriptions to the Government labor category description. <br><br>Q64.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv).(ii) Direct Material, Page 10 "The BOE worksheets shall reference all materials listed in the Materials summary worksheet applicable to the lowest WBS level" <br>Question:  Does the government require that the total estimated material be listed in detail in the Basis of Estimate (BOE), and the WBS Worksheets? Would the government consider having the material detail located in one place in the workbooks being provided and have the other required schedules tie out to it by summary in other required worksheets? <br>R64. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q65.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP." <br>Question:  Is it the Government's intention to limit past performance submissions by requiring relevancy to the Sample Tasks instead of relevancy to the broad PWS requirements? <br>R65.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q66. Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "Sections 1 & 2 of this file shall contain the Offeror's description of all Government and commercial contracts (prime contracts and subcontracts awarded or ongoing within three years prior to the date of issuance of this solicitation) that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation." Many IDIQ contracts allow up to five (5) years for relevant past performance contracts. <br>Question:  Would the Government consider extending the 'three (3) years' to 'five (5) years' for relevant past performance under this solicitation? <br>R66. No<br><br>Q67.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included major equipment suppliers in this category if the supplier's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task Price or the Total Proposed Price. Vendors of hardware and software are not typically under a teaming agreement because these manufacturers want as many prime bidders using their solutions as possible. Several of the C4 industry major equipment manufacturers (vendors) are also bidding prime. Since these vendors will also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. Question:  How will the Government handle this potential conflict of interest for prime bidders who are also potential major equipment suppliers (vendors) under the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor'? Recommendation: Remove 'vendor (both hardware & software)' from the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor.' <br>R67.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q68.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included vendor relationships in this category if the vendor's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task or the Total Proposed Price. <br>Question:  If a vendor is unwilling to provide past performance information due to a potential conflict of interest, what is the consequence to the prime bidder? <br>R68. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q69.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.e and 1.f, Page 8<br>Comment:  Under this section reference, (e) and (f) are repeated. <br>R69. Corrected<br><br>Q70.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.f (second (f) at the bottom of Page 8) "(f) Extent of Commitment: Provide documentation regarding enforceable commitments to utilize any Small Business category, as defined by FAR 19, as subcontractors. Enforceable commitments for this effort including teaming agreements. Copies of such agreements should be provided as part of your small business participation plan." <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the sentence fragment "Enforceable commitments for this effort including teaming agreements." <br>R70. This sentence has been deleted. <br><br>Q71.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Page 9 "For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed." The Government describes multiple tiers of spreadsheets rolling up into other spreadsheets and it is very difficult to evaluate the need for questions without looking at what is being described. <br>Question:  Does the Government intend to release the following documents prior to final RFP release? ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2_Cost Detail.xls, ST3_Cost Detail.xls, ST_Cost Detail.xls <br>R71. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q72.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.d, Page 7 "Additionally an Offeror who qualifies as a small business should include its prime contractor dollars in calculating its proposed percentage goals in all of the small business categories that it qualifies for example, an Offeror contractor who is a small woman owned business gets credit in the prime category, the small category, and the women owned small business category. " <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the meaning of this paragraph with regard to the statement 'prime category?' <br>R72. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q73.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Page 9 "For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed." <br>Question:  Does the Government intend to include a WBS in the pricing spreadsheets with the final RFP release that contains the WBS level of detail at which the Cost Plus Fixed Fee sample task pricing will be evaluated? <br>R73. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q74.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv).i & ii, Page 10/11 "-for S/IE efforts greater than $700k the subcontractor shall provide support in the same level of detail as the prime for each sample task. -each S/IE cost by contractor shall be detailed sufficiently to distinguish effort applicable by WBS and CLIN. The BOE worksheets shall detail the S/IE agencies proposed at the lowest WBS level. Detail S/IE hours applicable to Government provided labor categories as applicable." This section seems to indicate the Government is requiring 'major subcontractors', that are not 'interdivisional' to the prime, disclose the same level of pricing detail as the prime through references to Sections (iv) i and ii (direct labor and material) at the lowest WBS level. Since these subcontractors may also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. <br>Question:  What is the consequence to the prime if the major subcontractor (vendor) refuses to provide its proprietary information to the prime for inclusion in the WBS pricing buildup worksheet? <br>R74. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q75.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Pages 9 and 11 There is no section 'a' on Page 9 but there is a section 'b' on Page 11. <br>Question: Is this a typographical error?<br>R75. Yes - Corrected.<br><br>Q76.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv).(c), Page 11/12 "The Offeror shall submit a sanitized version of the excel files detailed in paragraphs a, and b and C. NO PRICE DATA (RATES/SUMMARY DOLLARS) shall be included in the SANITIZED Files." <br>Question:  What is the Government's instruction for the naming of the sanitized version of the file? <br>R76. SANITIZED_COST<br><br>Q77.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "As a result of the Cost Realism analysis, the proposed cost for the Cost Reimbursement Sample Task may be adjusted only for purposes of determining the probable cost. " In the prior version of the Draft RFP, Section M regarding the Price/Cost evaluation approach, the approach stated that it would only adjust proposed CLIN prices upward for the purposes of evaluation. The current Draft RFP Section M, Price/Cost Evaluation Approach noted above omits this statement and states it will adjust for purposes of Probable cost. <br>Question:  Is the Government planning to adjust the proposals both up and down? <br>R77. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q78.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12 "To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for the Technical Factor and all Technical Subfactor Sample Tasks, and the SBPP factor." <br>Question:  Given the small business past performance must achieve an 'acceptable' rating to be eligible for award, can the Government clarify what is required to achieve an 'acceptable' rating? <br>R78. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines (4 March 2011) for source selection as a guide for all ratings and evaluation factors will be specified in Section M of the RFP. <br><br>Q79.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract whereas CLINs (ST0001- ST0003) are notional only and will be used for source selection evaluation purposes only and will not become part of the contract" <br>Question:  What is the basis of award and what is to be awarded under CLIN's 0001-0002? <br>R79. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q80.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(i), page 4 AND Section M, Section C.1.b, page 14 "...Prices shall not appear in Volume I. Prices for the Sample Task TEPs shall only be provided in response to the Price/Cost Proposal submission requirements." AND "The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and to which the proposed end results are achievable. The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful performance and completion. The evaluation shall consider realism of the proposed hours, material and labor mix. The evaluation will also assess the performance risk associated with the difference between the proposed price and the probable price developed as a result of the Cost Realism analysis of the Fixed Price Sample Tasks." These statements seem to conflict. Instructions are clear that 'prices shall not appear in Volume I,' yet the Technical Evaluation Criteria includes a reference to pricing. Question:  Will the Government please clarify the seemingly contradictory statements referenced above? <br>R80. The statements above are not contradictory.  Offerors are to provide a Cost Proposal IAW Section L (iv) VOLUME IV - PRICE-COST (FACTOR). This cost proposal will contain prices. In addition, in order to determine realism, Offerors are to provide a sanitized version (a copy of the cost proposal with the dollar amounts removed) of any materials requested in the technical volume so that realism of approach can be determined.  <br><br>Q81.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12/13 In the draft Section L&M dated June 24, the government removed the following statement that was included in the draft dated March 24: "With regards to Past Performance a risk rating of: Low Risk, Moderate Risk or Unknown Risk can be considered "Acceptable" while a rating of "High Risk" is considered "Unacceptable" and not eligible for award." <br>Question:  Was this section explaining the past performance evaluation rationale intentionally removed in the June 24 draft? <br>R81. This was removed intentionally. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines for source selection as a guide for all ratings.<br><br>Q82.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12/13 In the draft Section L&M dated June 24, the government removed the following statement that was included in the draft dated March 24: "With regards to Past Performance a risk rating of: Low Risk, Moderate Risk or Unknown Risk can be considered "Acceptable" while a rating of "High Risk" is considered "Unacceptable" and not eligible for award." <br>Question:  Will an unacceptable risk rating for Past Performance make the bidder ineligible for an award? <br>R82.Yes<br><br>Q83.  Reference:  Section M, Section A, Page 12/13 In the draft Section L&M dated June 24, the government removed the following statement that was included in the draft dated March 24: "With regards to Past Performance a risk rating of: Low Risk, Moderate Risk or Unknown Risk can be considered "Acceptable" while a rating of "High Risk" is considered "Unacceptable" and not eligible for award." <br>Question:  What are the evaluation criteria relative to Past Performance? <br>R83. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines (4 March 2011) for source selection as a guide for all ratings. <br><br>Q84.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the threshold above which 'additional credit' will be given? <br>R84. This reference has been removed<br><br>Q85.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Given that the Small Business Past Performance is either acceptable or unacceptable in the evaluation criteria, can the Government clarify how 'additional credit' is computed (given) and incorporated into the evaluation process for the Small Business Past Performance? <br>R85. This reference has been removed<br><br>Q86.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the tiers and structure of the 'additional credit' above the threshold? <br>R86. The above reference has been removed. <br><br>Q87.  Reference:  March 24, 2011 Section M, Section C.1.a Adequacy of Response, Page 17 "The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the sample task. The proposals will be evaluated to determine the Offerors understanding of applicable government processes and compliance requirements necessary to achieve success. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the sample tasks have been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the following criteria: (1) proposal submission instruction section of the solicitation, (2) Adequacy of the Offeror and its subcontractor's with regard to facilities, equipment, processes and personnel to perform the sample tasks will be assessed, (3) The Offeror's capability to design, develop, produce, deploy, sustain and manage complex C3T programs, as set forth in the Sample Tasks which are part of this Section L requirement. (4) The Offeror's production capability, facilities, processes and equipment necessary to manufacture quality C3T systems and equipment." <br>Question:  The wording above was removed from the most recent draft of Section L&M. This section contained clearly defined criteria (specifically items 2, 3, and 4) for evaluating sample task responses. What was the rational for removing these criteria? <br>R87. The Government will be utilizing the DOD guidelines (4 March 2011) for this source selection. <br><br>Q88.  Reference:  Section M, C.1.a Understanding of the problem, Page 14 "The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it presents a clear understanding of all techniques involved in solving the problems and meeting the requirements; and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed." As written, the Government will be evaluating the Offeror's understanding of the techniques involved in solving the problems rather than evaluating the Offeror's understanding of the problems. <br>Question:  Can the Government please clarify if they are evaluating the Offeror's understanding of the techniques or the Offeror's understanding of the problem? <br>R88. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q89.  As part of the prime's proposal, will the prime be required to submit rate schedules for itself and separate rate schedules for its subcontractors? <br>R89.  Ref to R28<br><br>Q90.  Are the Table of Contents and Executive Summary included in the page counts of Volumes I and II as defined in Table 2 of the Draft Section L & M? <br>R90. No<br><br>Q91.  Reference:  Per page 4, 1st paragraph, the current Draft Section L and M says the following: The TEP shall address the information indicated in parenthesis and italics in the applicable Sample Task. <br>Question:  Would you please clarify what is meant by information indicated in parenthesis and italics? <br>R91. This has been removed.<br><br>Q92.  Reference:  In Section L, 2 c on page 3, it states that "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion." It continues to describe on the next page the "Narrative discussion" as consisting of the information for each separate task which we know from Table 2 on page 3 to be limited to 80 pages. <br>Question:  It is then assumed that the Table of Contents and Executive Summary Section do not count in this page limit. Is our understanding correct? <br>R92. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q93.  Reference:  In Section L, 2 c on page 3, it clearly states that "All price data shall only be contained in the PRICE-COST.xls file." Yet in the response to the Small Business Participation Plan (particularly on pages 6 to 8), it requires us to enter dollar amounts for the total bid and small business participation.<br>Question:  May we omit the dollar value in each of these entries and provide the percentage of total contract value? <br>R93. No<br><br>Q94.  Reference:  Concerning Sample Task Orders (STO): Small businesses could struggle to respond to STOs that are scoped identical to the Large Business STOs. This is also true of STOs that are written and scoped as large business STOs and then reduced in quantity in a manner that still requires a disproportionate response that covers all the same work activities. <br>Comment:  It is recommended that specific, tailored SB STOs be used that are representative of the scope of contemplated SB Task Orders under the awarded IDIQ. <br>R94. Sample Task Orders have been written with the intent to request that Offerors propose a feasible approach to fulfilling a realistic requirement suitable for either small or large business offerors. <br><br>Q95.  Reference:  Price evaluation: Part 2.c.(iv) page 9 explicitly states that "Offerors prices proposed for the Sample Tasks will only be used for evaluation purposes." Some offerors will interpret this to mean that proposed sample Task Order pricing is not binding, and will propose unrealistically low STO pricing in order to be more favorably evaluated. While these unrealistic prices may result in a more favorable evaluation, this offeror could not possibly use this pricing to successfully perform the STO. The draft section L&M pricing (part 4.(b) page 17) evaluation scheme outlined to determine Cost Realism will serve to mitigate this to some degree.<br>Comment:  It is recommend that STO pricing be binding in order to ensure that the government receives reasonable and realistic pricing to evaluate. <br>R95. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q96.  Reference:  Page 17, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section <br>Question:  Please explain the purpose of the following calculations in evaluating the offeror's proposal. Are the numbers supposed to add up to the contract value of $10.2 B? The Government will calculate the 'Projected Number of DOs/TOs' for each of the three Sample Tasks as follows: ($1.5 Billion)/(Sample Task #1 average) = anticipated # of DOs/TOs under Sample Task #1 ($6.5 Billion)/(Sample Task #2 average) = anticipated # of DOs/TOs under Sample Task #2 ($1,984,902,500)/(Sample Task #3 average) = anticipated # of DOs/TOs under Sample Task #3 <br>R96. The purpose of this calculation is to evaluate the cost of an Offeror's solutions to the sample tasks over the entire lifecycle of the contract.<br><br>Q97.  Reference:  Page 3, Section L.2.C, Content Requirements.<br>Question:  Does the Executive Summary have a page count? <br>R97. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count however this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal.  <br><br>Q98.  Reference:  Page 17, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, Page 19, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, last table <br>Question:  The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) formula does not seem to be the same as the last table on page 19. The description of the TEP on page 17 states that the proposed price of each Sample task will be multiplied by the anticipated # of Dos/TOs and summed to equal the Total Evaluated Price. The final table on page 19 indicates that the sum of the three Sample Tasks will be the Total Evaluated Price. Will the government please clarify which is correct? <br>R98.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q99.  Reference:  L.2.c.ii states "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP." <br>Question:  Please clarify if a greater degree of subcontract/teaming would be evaluated more favorably than a lesser degree of subcontract/teaming. In other words, would the government prefer past performance references with larger teams or smaller teams? <br>R99. The government has no preference. <br><br>Q100.  Reference:  L.2.c.ii states "(a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" <br>Question:  Please clarify if, based on the definition above, a hardware or software supplier accounting for 20% or more of a sample task would be considered either a vendor or a major subcontractor?  Please note that the industry standard is to consider such hardware/software suppliers as vendors only, whereas only companies who are integral to the delivery and performance of the task would be considered a subcontractor or a major subcontractor. <br>R100. The definition in L.2.c.ii is the definition that will be used for this contract and the offeror's response must comply with the RFP.  Additionally any vendor/subcontractor providing 20% or more of a sample task would be considered a major subcontractor.   <br><br>Q101.  Reference:  Page 3, para 2c and Page 4, para 2c(i).  <br>Question:  Are the Executive summaries for Volumes I and II included within the volume's page limit?<br>R101. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count however this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal.<br><br>Q102.  Reference:  Page 3, para 2c and Page 4, para 2c(i).<br>Question:  Will be there a page limit for each Executive Summary?<br>R102. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count however this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal.<br><br>Q103.  Reference:  Page 3, para 2c and Page 4, para 2c(i).<br>Question:  Will the Government provide further guidance as to their expectation of the content of each Executive Summary, e.g., an outline?<br>R103. The Executive Summary does not count as part of the overall page count.  However this is a summary section and should only include information presented in the overall proposal. <br><br>Q104.

The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q106.  Reference:  Page 9, para 2c(iv).  <br>Question:  A summary worksheet for the proposed Sample Task is provided on Attachment 04 ST Cost Detail.  Is the Attachment 04 available?  If not, will the attachment be available prior to RFP release?<br>R106.  All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q107.  Reference:  Page 9, para 2c(iv) (first and second paras regarding instructions for WBS). <br>Question:  Will WBS be Government furnished?  If yes when will it be available?<br>R107.

<DESC>Response to Industry Questions for 06 July 2011 Draft Section L&M SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following are questions and responses 1 through 50 to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of 13 July 2011, 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1.  There are contracts in which a company is performing as a subcontractor to another company on a similar and relevant program as defined by the GTACS Draft PWS, and these two companies are also known direct competitors for the GTACS opportunity.  This is a possible Organizational Conflict of Interest (FAR part 9.5) to directly solicit a Past Performance Survey from these companies, as these GTACS competitors may have "impaired objectivity" in their responses.  Therefore, please confirm that a Past Performance Survey is not required for a company which is a subcontractor to a known and direct GTACS competitor, due to an OCI concern.  If these subject Past Performance Surveys are required in this situation, please advise if these requests can be submitted directly to the government customer (not competitor), due to the aforementioned rationale.<br>R1.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q2.  As it appears that 60% or more of the contract value will be met through the purchase of material goods (hardware), will the RFP allow for fee to be applied on all material purchases?<br>R2. Fixed price contracts are described in FAR 16.201 and there is no separation of cost elements in such contracts.   FAR Part 16.3 describes in detail the various types of Cost Reimbursement contracts and how fee is approached in such contracts.  <br><br>Q3.  Reference:  Page 3 - The table has been renamed to Table 2<br>Question:  Is there a Table 1 or is this an error?<br>R3. This should be Table 1<br><br>Q4.  Reference:  Page 3 - L2(c) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section and the Narrative discussion."  <br>Question:  Is there a page limit for the required Executive Summary per volume? If so please advise page limit of executive summary per volume.<br>R4.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q5.  Reference:  Page 3 - Regarding the Executive Summary for Technical Volume. <br>Question:  Since the technical volume will likely be evaluated by three separate teams for each sample task, will the government distribute the Executive Summary for this volume to each of the same task evaluation teams?<br>R5. Yes<br><br>Q6.  Reference:  Page 4 - L 2 (i) - first sentence refers to Table 1 <br>Question:  Should this be Table 2 on page 3?<br>R6. Yes, Section L&M have been revised for the final RFP<br><br>Q7.  Reference:  Page 6 - Section 3 Subcontracts <br>Question:  Should this section be "Subcontractors"?<br>R7. Subcontracts<br><br>Q8.  Reference:  Page 6 - Section 3 <br>Question:  Does the Government want the information of all proposed subcontractors or only the major subcontractors?<br>R8. Major subcontractors only<br><br>Q9.  Reference:  Page 9 <br>Question:  Will Instructions for WBS Cost Elements worksheets be released prior to the final RFP?<br>R9. No<br><br>Q10.  Reference:  Page 9 - "Instructions for Cost Elements are identified in following subparagraphs of this section and an example of the submission workbook is provided at Attachment04, ST Cost Detail.xls." <br>Question:  Will Attachment 4 be released prior to the final RFP?<br>R10.  Attachment 4 will not be released prior to RFP.<br><br>Q11.  Reference:  Page 10 - (i) <br>Question:   Will Enclosure 5 be released prior to the final RFP? <br>R11. All enclosures will not be released prior to the RFP <br><br>Q12.  Reference:  Page 12 - section (e) <br>Question:  Should this be section (g)?<br>R12. The above reference cannot be found   <br><br>Q13.  Reference:  Page 12 - Section (f) <br>Question:  Should this be section (h)?<br>R13. The above reference cannot be found   <br><br>Q14.  Does the government intend to provide additional information regarding the weighting of evaluation criteria within each volume?<br>R14. The weighting is defined section M<br><br>Q15.  Reference:  Page 15 - (c) - "Adequacy of Approach: The Sample Task will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach demonstrate adequate and complete consideration of and satisfaction of the requirements specified in the solicitation. The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation."  Question:  When referring to "in the solicitation" is the Government referring to requirements in sample task, section L and PWS? <br>R15. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q16.  Reference:  On page 4, section (ii) opening paragraph, the government removed relevancy of PWS for Past Performance but left Sample Tasks in the new draft, but on page 6 of the same section, (ii)(c), "citing the applicable Government PWS paragraph number" is still requested. Question:  Could the government provide more insight into what references to the PWS are required and if a new PWS will be issued prior to the final RFP?<br>R16. The Offeror shall utilize the solicitation PWS as a reference when providing examples of relevant work their Major Subcontractors have completed.<br><br>Q17.  Reference: General<br>Question: To avoid repetition in the 3 Sample Tasks (ST), and to maximize technical content in the ST page counts, will the Government please consider a concise 10 page Management and Risk Control Plan which describes the overall team construct, management controls and tools, and unique facilities that would be applicable to all 3 ST responses?<br>R17. The Contracting Officer has taken this under consideration and has decided that the current methodology is sufficient enough in detail to ascertain an Offeror's ability to manage the Risk associated with this effort.    <br> <br>Q18. Reference: L.2.c - Content Requirements, Page 3.  "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion."<br>Question:  Please provide a summary of what is desired in the Narrative Discussion for Volume V, Solicitation, Offer and Award Documents and Certifications/Representations; and if Narrative Discussions for Volume V will be evaluated.<br>R18.  Section L 'Instructions to Offerors' of Volume V - Solicitation, Offer and Award Documents and Certifications/Representations as listed in the draft L&M which was posted provides the answer to this question.  Additional clarification can be found in FAR Part 15 and clause FAR clause 52.212-2.  <br><br>Q19. Reference:  L.2.c(ii) - Volume II  - Past Performance (FACTOR), page 4.  "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP. <br>Question:  The referenced phrase has been modified from the previous draft to require relevancy against the sample tasks in lieu of the overall contract PWS. Would the government prefer to see references for work that are specifically relevant to the sample tasks (however focused they may be) as well as references that show relevance against the contract-level PWS? Additionally, should relevant work cited be limited to the specific system types discussed in the sample tasks, or would the Government prefer to see a range of relevant system types covered across the referenced work?  Please give additional guidance in this area; it is currently unclear whether offerors should focus only on the sample tasks to show relevancy or whether we should focus on both the sample tasks and the contract-level PWS.<br>R19.  The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q20.  Reference:  L.2.c(iii)(b) Volume III, SBPP, page 6, para iii (b).  "Total Contract Value (including options)":  L.2.c(iii)(d), page 7, under NOTE - "All percentages should use TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE as a baseline." :  SB Subcontracting Plan, para 3(a), page 9 - "base your percentages on TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE".<br>Question:  How is "Total Contract Value" calculated?  Is the Total Contract Value simply the sum of the offeror's proposed prices for the three sample tasks?  Does Total Contract Value = Total Evaluated Price?  Please clarify.<br>R20.  "Total Contract Value" (TCV)<br><br>For the purposes of the Small Business PARTICIPATION plan - the TCV will be $10B.  <br>Offerors are required to propose a percentage of the total acquisition value dollars to be awarded to small business subcontractors or teaming partners. The dollars proposed must correlate to the dollars and percentages identified in the SB subcontracting plan. <br>For how to determine Total Evaluated Price, see Section M:  'Price/Cost Evaluation Approach'. <br><br><br>Q21.  Reference:  L.2.c(iii)(f)(2), Page 9<br>Question:  In accordance with the Draft Section L, Volume III, # (2) on Page 9; Each large Business Offeror shall provide a small business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9.  In accordance with this clause, goals are to be stated as a percentage of subcontracting dollars.  What are the specific goals to be achieved by Large Businesses on the Subcontracting Plan?<br>R21. Refer to Draft Section L & M page 16; 3, g.<br><br>Q22.  Reference:  M.A, Basis for Award, page 13.  "Offerors remaining within the competitive range..."<br>Question:  What specific criteria will be used to establish a competitive range?<br>R22. The Contracting Officer will establish the competitive range once all proposals have been received and evaluated in accordance with Section M. <br><br>Q23.  Reference:  M.A, Basis for Award, page 13.  "Offerors remaining within the competitive range..."<br>Question:  If a bidder is in the competitive range, how will the Government assess best value to make/not make an award?<br>R23. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q24.  Reference:  M.B.1, Factor 1 - Technical, page 13.  "Each subfactor will be evaluated and adjectivally rated individually."<br>Question:  What adjectival ratings will be used to distinguish proposal section evaluation from another? The RFP mentions an "acceptable" rating, but no scale or range of ratings is provided. Recommend that section M include this rating scale, along with the specific criteria that would be evaluated to determine a given rating. Also recommend that a similar rating scale and criteria be provided for the past performance and small business participation plan evaluations.<br>R24. The source selection process will be following DOD source selection guidelines (4 March 2011) of which the adjectival ratings are described.  The Government will not be releasing them separately. <br><br>Q25.  Reference:  M.C - Evaluation Approach, Page 14. "Any Offeror that is already affiliated with or is contemplating any contractual relationship with any of the above companies shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, but no later than ten (10) days after issuance of the solicitation."<br>Question:  Is the contractual relationship intended to be related specifically to this effort; or does it pertain to any other relationship the parties may have beyond this solicitation?<br>R25. This reference pertains to any and all relationships to the parties mentioned both with this solicitation and beyond it.<br><br>Q26.  Reference:  M.C.1 - Past Performance Evaluation Approach. Page 15<br>Question:  Please confirm that the Past Performance Evaluation Approach should be re-numbered with a "2."<br>R26. Correct<br><br>Q27.  Reference:  PWS Section 1.0 - Scope.  The PWS specifically states "The GTACS program and contract will provide the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support the mission of PEO C3T, its PMs, PdMs and PDs."  <br>Question:  Throughout the PWS all work and Task Areas 1, 2, and 3 focus on providing services and solutions for tactical C3 systems.  The PEO C3T systems provide the tactical communications infrastructure which enable voice, data and video communications on the battlefield not only for Army communications elements but for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems as well.   <br>Interoperability requirements need to be understood by the potential bidders to propose services and solutions that are seamlessly integrated into the overall tactical battlefield.   Will the PWS and Task Areas 1, 2 and 3 specifically define the C3 systems interoperability requirements for all external hardware, software and communications systems that PEO C3T is required to interface within CONUS and OCONUS locations?  Will the respective Interface Control Documents and Systems Architecture Information Exchange Requirements be provided for Task Areas 1 through 3 (and the respective Sample Tasks if applicable) that require solutions to be integrated into the overall PEO C3T System of Systems Enterprise?<br>R27. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q28.  As part of the prime's proposal, will the prime be required to submit rate schedules for itself and separate rate schedules for its subcontractors?<br>R28. Prime offerors will be required to submit an excel file that contains the Prime's direct and indirect rates applicable to performance of the three sample tasks. Additionally, the prime contractors will be required to provide Cost and Price Analysis (CAPA) documentation for all subcontractor and interorganizational transfers' costs proposed in the three sample tasks that exceed $700K. This CAPA documentation shall address the following (which will be included in the cost and pricing spread sheet to be released with the final RFP):<br><br>1. Was adequate price competition obtained or its absence properly justified?<br>2. Did the Prime contractor adequately assess and dispose of subcontractors' alternate proposals, if offered?<br>3. Does the Prime contractor have a sound basis for selecting and determining the responsibility of the particular subcontractor?<br>4. Has the Prime contractor performed adequate cost or price analysis or price comparisons and obtained certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data if no exception applies?<br>5. Does the Prime offeror have a DCAA approved purchasing system? <br><br><br>Q29.  Are the Table of Contents and Executive Summary included in the page counts of Volumes I and II as defined in Table 2 of the Draft Section L & M?<br>R29.  No<br><br>Q30.  Reference:  Per page 4, 1st paragraph, the current Draft Section L and M says the following: The TEP shall address the information indicated in parenthesis and italics in the applicable Sample Task. <br>Question:  Would you please clarify what is meant by information indicated in parenthesis and italics?   <br> R30. Reference will be removed.<br><br>Q31.   Reference:  section L, 2, c, pg 3<br>Question:  Request that the Government consider not requiring an Executive Summary for each of the five (5) files listed in Table 2. Recommend that the Executive Summary be included only with the first file (Volume 1, Technical).<br>R31. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q32.  Reference:  section L, iii, Volume II, pg 4<br>Question:  In accordance with Section L and M, past performance reporting is required for subcontractors who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task. Please advise how many days will industry have to provide past performance to the Government for these 20% subcontracts. If industry is allowed the full 30 day proposal response periods to submit past performance assessment questionnaires by their past performance program customers, it will allow industry an opportunity to internally compete the requirements, thus providing the best partnering solution with regard to technical, price, and small business considerations.<br>R32. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q33. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, b, pg 6<br>Question:  "Total Contract Value" is no longer equal to "Total Evaluated Price" as was originally stated in a previous Q&A. It appears that the current definition of "Total Contract Value" is the sum of bidder's prices for ST1 + ST2 + ST3 including options. Please confirm this assumption.<br>R33.  "Total Contract Value" (TCV) <br><br>For the purposes of the Small Business PARTICIPATION plan - the TCV will be $10B.  References to the Small Business SUBCONTRACTING Plan normally request either the dollars or percentages intended to be subcontracted.  Each offeror will only be held to the percentages proposed not the dollars as an offeror may not reach the ceiling."<br><br>For how to determine Total Evaluated Price, see Section M:  'Price/Cost Evaluation Approach'. <br><br><br>Q34. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, pg 7<br>Question:  Draft Section L and M state that Offerors are to provide a list of small business's within Volume III, and that small and large subcontractors performing on any one of the three sample tasks are to be referenced in the Technical Proposal. Because GTACS is a broad Contract to support all of PEO C3T Program Management Offices and Programs, it is highly possible that not all team members products and services will be utilized in the 3 evaluated sample tasks, but may be utilized on future GTACS efforts. The inclusion and discussion of all team members and subcontractors at contract award is recommended to avoid time consuming requests and modifications in future Task Order awards, and will ensure PEO C3T has broad technology-based teams to perform all work necessary as defined by the PWS. Therefore, it is suggested that the Government add a teammate matrix that is matched to the PWS, as part of the RFP and provide ample space for a complete team identification and role/capability-based response.<br>R34. The government has taken this under consideration and will not be requiring a team mate matrix.  The team should be discussed within the proposal in accordance with section L. <br><br>Q35. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  Regarding the section starting, "(e) List principal supplies/services to be subcontracted to. Be specific as possible (i.e. references to statement of work, etc) that will demonstrate a variety and complexity of work: Please define "principal" in this context, since there may be very differing perceptions of this.<br>R35. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q36. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  The HBCU/MI category appears in the underlined structure on the bottom of page 7, but does not appear in the structure on the top of page 7. Please advise if bidders will be required to meet any specific Government defined HBCU/MI goals. It had been understood that the HBCU reference had been removed in a previous question response.<br>R36. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q37. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, p 9<br>Question:  Request the Government provide an example of the draft attachment 04, ST_Cost Detail.xls and the instructions for WBS cost element and cost elements worksheets, as soon as possible. The Pre-solicitation Draft Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire for SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-RC001 GTACS and previous responses R1, R31, R32 and R52 all indicated the Government would provide the workbook. Please advise when this important document can be provided. Early release of this document will be beneficial in reduction of industry questions and possible resulting delays.<br>R37. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted unless otherwise notified.   <br><br>Q38. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, p 9<br>Question:  Suggest that the Government consider providing the WBS and cost worksheets formats. Also, we suggest the cost worksheet format utilize the Government fiscal year versus the contractor fiscal year, for clarity and consistency across all proposal responses.<br>R38. The Government has taken this under consideration and is remaining with contractor fiscal year.<br><br>Q39. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, p 9<br>Question:  Section L under Volume IV - Cost Price states, "Each WBS Cost Summary Worksheet will have for each Cost Element, a reference to a worksheet (single tab within workbook) containing the supporting calculations, formulas, and line item details necessary for the Government to evaluate the individual components of the Cost Element by WBS by Contractor Fiscal Year." It was mentioned in the previous industry responses (R1, R2, R3, R31, R32, R52) that this workbook will be government defined and provided. Please confirm that it is still the plan for this workbook to be Government defined and provided.<br>R39. Correct<br><br>Q40. Reference:  section L, iv, Volume IV, I, pg 10<br>Question:  Regarding the section starting "..each Offeror proposed labor category shall also map to a government provided labor category (see Enclosure 05)". Please advise when the Government will provide Enclosure 05 and how many labor categories are included. Early release of this document would be beneficial in reduction of industry questions and possible resulting delays.<br>R40. All solicitation attachments will be released when the RFP is posted<br><br>Q41. Reference:  section L., iv, Volume IV, pg's 10 & 12<br>Question:  The previous Responses to Draft Sections L&M Questions from Industry, dated June 15, 2011 state (R40, R43, R75 and R76) that certified cost or pricing data will not be required, but that other than cost or pricing data may be requested for the evaluation of sample tasks. In revised Draft Section L& M section (iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Efforts), it states that the prime contractor must provide the cost/price analysis for all S/IE costs over $700K. However, the later section (d, Cost/Price Proposal Supporting documents), states that the prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis and source selection data for all S/IE costs over $700K. Please advise which of these conflicting sections should be followed.  <br>R41. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q42. Reference:  section L., iv, Volume IV, pg 11<br>Question:  Section IV - Cost-Price (Factor), vii. Fee/Profit states that FPRA or FPRA can be used in lieu of indirect cost pool components. However, Section IV - Cost-Price (Factor), v. Indirect Costs requests a detailed breakdown of Indirect Costs. Please advise if the FPRA or FPRA data can also be used in lieu of the Indirect Costs detail.<br>R42. If an offeror provides a valid FPRA for a specific cost element (direct or indirect), a breakdown for that specific direct or indirect cost will not be required.     <br><br>Q43. Reference:  section M, 4, pg 18<br>Question:  It is stated in the section that CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract. Please define these CLINS. Please advise if these CLINS will be contractually incorporated at the IDIQ vehicle award or at future task order awards.<br>R43. The answer to this question will be posted at a later date.<br><br>Q44. Reference:   General<br>Question:  Please advise estimated schedule for Draft RFP and RFP. An estimated schedule would be of great benefit to Industry for planning and resource allocation purposes.<br>R44. Estimate fourth quarter FY11<br><br>Q45. Reference:   General<br>Question:  This Draft release appears to rescind or ignore some of the previously released answers to Industry questions as posted. Please advise if the current Draft Section L&M dated 6/24/2011supersedes previous answers which would now appear in conflict.<br>R45. The draft Section L&M supersedes previous versions, and is consistent with previous Government responses.<br><br>Q46. Reference:  Jun 15, 2011 Government Answers to Questions and Comments.  Q57: Please confirm that a winning prime will not be allowed to bring on additional sub-contractors following an award.  R57: The winning Prime will be allowed to bring additional Subcontractors on following the award. "The request for the replacement of a sub-contractor after contract award shall be formally made to the contracting officer in writing - along with accompanying rationale for replacement.  R56: The Government does not intend to eliminate the term "enforceable commitment, Enforceable commitment serves as a mean to ensure Small Business participation and as a deterrent from switching Small Business team members without the approval of the Contracting Officer and the Chief Associate Director of CECOM Small Business.<br>Comment:  The Government's 15 June, 2011 response addressed the addition of a subcontractor.  However, the response relates it to the "replacement" of a subcontractor. The addition of a subcontractor is not the same as the replacement of a subcontractor.  The term "replacement" alludes to dropping a subcontractor and substituting with another subcontractor.  The term "addition" refers to bringing on a new subcontractor but not switching the new subcontractor for another from the Prime's list of subcontractors.<br>Question:  Can the Government confirm that a winning prime will be allowed to bring on additional subcontractors following an award without having to remove an existing subcontractor from the Prime's team?<br>R46.

<DESC>Response to Un-answered Industry Questions for 06 July 2011 Draft Section L&M SOLICITATION W15P7T-11-R-C001 Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems (GTACS) and Services<br><br>The following are questions and responses not previously answered to Draft Section L & M questions from industry received as of 13 July 2011, 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time.<br><br>Q1.  There are contracts in which a company is performing as a subcontractor to another company on a similar and relevant program as defined by the GTACS Draft PWS, and these two companies are also known direct competitors for the GTACS opportunity.  This is a possible Organizational Conflict of Interest (FAR part 9.5) to directly solicit a Past Performance Survey from these companies, as these GTACS competitors may have "impaired objectivity" in their responses.  Therefore, please confirm that a Past Performance Survey is not required for a company which is a subcontractor to a known and direct GTACS competitor, due to an OCI concern.  If these subject Past Performance Surveys are required in this situation, please advise if these requests can be submitted directly to the government customer (not competitor), due to the aforementioned rationale.<br>R1.  The Offerors Past Performance Factor Proposal shall be submitted in accordance with Section L Volume II - Past Performance (Factor).  Any negative feedback will be carefully scrutinized and in accordance with FAR 15.306 the Offeror will be given the opportunity through clarifications and or discussions (if held) to clarify adverse past performance information. <br><br>Q4.  Reference:  Page 3 - L2(c) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section and the Narrative discussion."  <br>Question:  Is there a page limit for the required Executive Summary per volume? If so please advise page limit of executive summary per volume.<br>R4.  Section L1 will be updated to read:  The Offerors proposal shall consist of five volumes and a single Executive Summary (2 pages only). Section L 2 (c) will be updated to read: Each Offerors proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and each of the above volumes contained therein shall provide a Narrative discussion where appropriate<br><br>Q15.  Reference:  Page 15 - (c) - "Adequacy of Approach: The Sample Task will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach demonstrate adequate and complete consideration of and satisfaction of the requirements specified in the solicitation. The Sample Tasks will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation."  Question:  When referring to "in the solicitation" is the Government referring to requirements in sample task, section L and PWS? <br>R15. The Government is referring to Section L and related solicitation documents which include the Sample Tasks.  <br><br>Q19. Reference:  L.2.c(ii) - Volume II  - Past Performance (FACTOR), page 4.  "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP. <br>Question:  The referenced phrase has been modified from the previous draft to require relevancy against the sample tasks in lieu of the overall contract PWS. Would the government prefer to see references for work that are specifically relevant to the sample tasks (however focused they may be) as well as references that show relevance against the contract-level PWS? Additionally, should relevant work cited be limited to the specific system types discussed in the sample tasks, or would the Government prefer to see a range of relevant system types covered across the referenced work?  Please give additional guidance in this area; it is currently unclear whether offerors should focus only on the sample tasks to show relevancy or whether we should focus on both the sample tasks and the contract-level PWS.<br>R19.  The Sample Tasks only, as instructed in Section L.<br><br>Q23.  Reference:  M.A, Basis for Award, page 13.  "Offerors remaining within the competitive range..."<br>Question:  If a bidder is in the competitive range, how will the Government assess best value to make/not make an award?<br>R23. The determination will be made on the basis of Best Value Tradeoff in accordance with Section M - Evaluation Factors, A - Basis for Award. <br><br>Q27.  Reference:  PWS Section 1.0 - Scope.  The PWS specifically states "The GTACS program and contract will provide the flexibility and responsiveness needed to support the mission of PEO C3T, its PMs, PdMs and PDs."  <br>Question:  Throughout the PWS all work and Task Areas 1, 2, and 3 focus on providing services and solutions for tactical C3 systems.  The PEO C3T systems provide the tactical communications infrastructure which enable voice, data and video communications on the battlefield not only for Army communications elements but for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems as well.   <br>Interoperability requirements need to be understood by the potential bidders to propose services and solutions that are seamlessly integrated into the overall tactical battlefield.   Will the PWS and Task Areas 1, 2 and 3 specifically define the C3 systems interoperability requirements for all external hardware, software and communications systems that PEO C3T is required to interface within CONUS and OCONUS locations?  Will the respective Interface Control Documents and Systems Architecture Information Exchange Requirements be provided for Task Areas 1 through 3 (and the respective Sample Tasks if applicable) that require solutions to be integrated into the overall PEO C3T System of Systems Enterprise?<br>R27. No, the interoperability and interface control document requirements will not be specifically defined in the sample tasks.  However, there will be certain mission requirements where the Offeror is expected to understand the necessary interfaces and present a solution that meets the mission. The Sample Tasks are intended to provide the bidders a consistent equitable opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to satisfy the contract requirements. Specific DO/TO projects' RTEPs may require interoperability and as such will provide the information necessary for their award and execution.<br><br>Q31.   Reference:  section L, 2, c, pg 3<br>Question:  Request that the Government consider not requiring an Executive Summary for each of the five (5) files listed in Table 2. Recommend that the Executive Summary be included only with the first file (Volume 1, Technical).<br>R31. See Question/Response #4 above. <br><br>Q32.  Reference:  section L, iii, Volume II, pg 4<br>Question:  In accordance with Section L and M, past performance reporting is required for subcontractors who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task. Please advise how many days will industry have to provide past performance to the Government for these 20% subcontracts. If industry is allowed the full 30 day proposal response periods to submit past performance assessment questionnaires by their past performance program customers, it will allow industry an opportunity to internally compete the requirements, thus providing the best partnering solution with regard to technical, price, and small business considerations.<br>R32. The RFP will require all questionnaires to be sent directly to the government and are no longer the Offeror's responsibility<br><br>Q35. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  Regarding the section starting, "(e) List principal supplies/services to be subcontracted to. Be specific as possible (i.e. references to statement of work, etc) that will demonstrate a variety and complexity of work: Please define "principal" in this context, since there may be very differing perceptions of this.<br>R35. "Principal": Is defined as the most significant supplies or services the Offeror plans to subcontract out.<br><br>Q36. Reference:  section L, iii, Volume III, e, pg 7<br>Question:  The HBCU/MI category appears in the underlined structure on the bottom of page 7, but does not appear in the structure on the top of page 7. Please advise if bidders will be required to meet any specific Government defined HBCU/MI goals. It had been understood that the HBCU reference had been removed in a previous question response.<br>R36.  There are currently no goals associated with HBCU/MI for the Small Business Participation Plan however Section L, requires the bidders to provide/list proposed goals for all small business sub-categories deemed applicable by the offeror.<br><br>Q41. Reference:  section L., iv, Volume IV, pg's 10 & 12<br>Question:  The previous Responses to Draft Sections L&M Questions from Industry, dated June 15, 2011 state (R40, R43, R75 and R76) that certified cost or pricing data will not be required, but that other than cost or pricing data may be requested for the evaluation of sample tasks. In revised Draft Section L& M section (iv. Subcontracts/Interdivisional Efforts), it states that the prime contractor must provide the cost/price analysis for all S/IE costs over $700K. However, the later section (d, Cost/Price Proposal Supporting documents), states that the prime contractor must have available the cost/price analysis and source selection data for all S/IE costs over $700K. Please advise which of these conflicting sections should be followed.  <br>R41. The Government will revise the reference under Section L, Volume IV Price Cost (Factor), subparagraph (d) Cost/Price Proposal (Supporting Documents) to be consistent with the language referenced under Subcontracts/Interdivisional efforts.<br><br>Q43. Reference:  section M, 4, pg 18<br>Question:  It is stated in the section that CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract. Please define these CLINS. Please advise if these CLINS will be contractually incorporated at the IDIQ vehicle award or at future task order awards.<br>R43. The Fixed price (0001) and cost re-imbursement (0002) CLINs will become part of the contract for post-award efforts that are ultimately defined at the DO/TO level.. <br><br>Q55.  Reference:  Page 17 and 18, 24 June 2011Draft Section L&M Section M Para 4 b; On page 17,the  last paragraph before Table 1 CLIN List states "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract ... "  On page 18, Table 1 CLIN List, lines 3 and 4 state "CLIN 0001 (Fixed Price CLIN ) and "0002 (Cost Reimbursement CLIN)" are "For use on future Delivery/Task Orders."<br>Question:  Would the Government state which of two references to CLINs 0001 and 0002 the Offeror should use? Currently, definitions contradict each other.<br>R55. See Question/Response #43 above. <br><br>Q59.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 AND Section L, Section 2.c.(i) "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." AND "The Offeror shall provide its Technical Proposal (Volume I) in a separate file as specified in Table 1 above an executive summary as well as addressing the information below separately for each Sample Task 1, 2, & 3. " Sample Task 1 allows an additional 5 pages in the response and typically an Executive Summary provides an overview of the Offeror's complete submission. Question:  Does the Government desire an Executive Summary (overview of the entire submission) in Volume 1 and an abstract (overview of the solution presented in the volume) in each Volume?" <br>R59. See Question/Response #31 above.<br><br>Q61.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c, Page 3 "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion. The Executive Summary Section shall contain a brief abstract of the file." Typically an Executive Summary provides a high level overview of the Offeror's complete solution. <br>Question:  Can the Government please clarify the submission files that shall include an Executive Summary?<br>R61. See Question/Response #31 above..<br><br>Q64.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.(c).(iv).(ii) Direct Material, Page 10 "The BOE worksheets shall reference all materials listed in the Materials summary worksheet applicable to the lowest WBS level" <br>Question:  Does the government require that the total estimated material be listed in detail in the Basis of Estimate (BOE), and the WBS Worksheets? Would the government consider having the material detail located in one place in the workbooks being provided and have the other required schedules tie out to it by summary in other required worksheets? <br>R64. The Government will provide a sample BOE template, but Offerors are permitted to utilize their own format as long as all of the required information is provided. For evaluation purposes, the Government will require material proposed at the lowest level of WBS to facilitate Government evaluation. <br><br>Q65.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "Aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming for those development, production and sustainment sample tasks attached to the RFP." <br>Question:  Is it the Government's intention to limit past performance submissions by requiring relevancy to the Sample Tasks instead of relevancy to the broad PWS requirements? <br>R65.  It is not the Governments intention to limit past performance submissions; relevant past performance shall be based on the sample tasks only.<br><br>Q67.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included major equipment suppliers in this category if the supplier's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task Price or the Total Proposed Price. Vendors of hardware and software are not typically under a teaming agreement because these manufacturers want as many prime bidders using their solutions as possible. Several of the C4 industry major equipment manufacturers (vendors) are also bidding prime. Since these vendors will also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. Question:  How will the Government handle this potential conflict of interest for prime bidders who are also potential major equipment suppliers (vendors) under the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor'? Recommendation: Remove 'vendor (both hardware & software)' from the Government's definition of 'major subcontractor.' <br>R67  See Question/Response # 1 above.<br><br>Q68.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(ii), Page 4 "The Offeror shall include the same contract information for each major subcontractor proposed (a major subcontractor is a subcontractor who will be providing hardware, software or services whose subcontract is for more than 20% of any sample task or 20% of the sum of the all three sample tasks proposed prices.)" The Government is requiring prime bidders to submit past performance information for major subcontractors and has included vendor relationships in this category if the vendor's contribution is 20% of the total price of either a Sample Task or the Total Proposed Price. <br>Question:  If a vendor is unwilling to provide past performance information due to a potential conflict of interest, what is the consequence to the prime bidder? <br> R68. Offerors will not be penalized for lack of past performance they will instead be rated a neutral.  In addition all past performance questionnaires will be sent directly to the Government and are no longer the responsibility of the Offeror. See Question/Response # 1 above.<br><br>Q72.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iii) 1.d, Page 7 "Additionally an Offeror who qualifies as a small business should include its prime contractor dollars in calculating its proposed percentage goals in all of the small business categories that it qualifies for example, an Offeror contractor who is a small woman owned business gets credit in the prime category, the small category, and the women owned small business category. " <br>Question:  Can the Government clarify the meaning of this paragraph with regard to the statement 'prime category?' <br>R72. This reference to 'Prime Category' references the 'Total Small' category on page 7 of the draft RFP posted (vol. III SB Participation Plan).   When Calculating Small Business Participation percentages, if the prime company is a small business, it can include the percentage of work that it will perform in house; as a part of total small business category and any socio-economic category that is applicable as well as any work that is subcontracted to another small business..  <br><br>Q73.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv), Page 9 "For each Sample Task, a Cost Detail workbook that contains price summaries by lowest proposed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) level detailing the Cost Elements by Contractor Fiscal Year (ST1_Cost Detail.xls, ST2-Cost Detail.xls, and ST3_Cost Detail.xls) shall be proposed." <br>Question:  Does the Government intend to include a WBS in the pricing spreadsheets with the final RFP release that contains the WBS level of detail at which the Cost Plus Fixed Fee sample task pricing will be evaluated? <br>R73. A high level WBS will be provided to the Offeror. The Offeror should complete the lower levels of the WBS based on their specific business practices. <br><br>Q74.  Reference:  Section L, Section 2.c.(iv).i & ii, Page 10/11 "-for S/IE efforts greater than $700k the subcontractor shall provide support in the same level of detail as the prime for each sample task. -each S/IE cost by contractor shall be detailed sufficiently to distinguish effort applicable by WBS and CLIN. The BOE worksheets shall detail the S/IE agencies proposed at the lowest WBS level. Detail S/IE hours applicable to Government provided labor categories as applicable." This section seems to indicate the Government is requiring 'major subcontractors', that are not 'interdivisional' to the prime, disclose the same level of pricing detail as the prime through references to Sections (iv) i and ii (direct labor and material) at the lowest WBS level. Since these subcontractors may also be competing for a prime position on GTACS, they will have a conflict of interest in sharing past performance and pricing information with other primes with whom they are competing. <br>Question:  What is the consequence to the prime if the major subcontractor (vendor) refuses to provide its proprietary information to the prime for inclusion in the WBS pricing buildup worksheet? <br>R74.  Section L will be revised to provide instructions for subcontractors and interdivisional efforts to submit proprietary information directly to the Government. . <br><br>Q77.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "As a result of the Cost Realism analysis, the proposed cost for the Cost Reimbursement Sample Task may be adjusted only for purposes of determining the probable cost. " In the prior version of the Draft RFP, Section M regarding the Price/Cost evaluation approach, the approach stated that it would only adjust proposed CLIN prices upward for the purposes of evaluation. The current Draft RFP Section M, Price/Cost Evaluation Approach noted above omits this statement and states it will adjust for purposes of Probable cost. <br>Question:  Is the Government planning to adjust the proposals both up and down? <br>R77. Cost Realism analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 (d) will be used to derive the probable cost for each sample task.  <br><br>Q79.  Reference:  Section M, Section 4.a, Page 17 "CLINs (0001-0002) will become part of the contract whereas CLINs (ST0001- ST0003) are notional only and will be used for source selection evaluation purposes only and will not become part of the contract" <br>Question:  What is the basis of award and what is to be awarded under CLIN's 0001-0002? <br>R79. Awards will be made in accordance with Section M - Evaluation Factors, A - Basis for Award.  Also see Question/Response # 43 and 55 above.<br><br>Q85.  Reference:  Section M, Section C.3.g, Page 16 (last paragraph) "Offerors may receive additional credit for more aggressive Small Business requirements." <br>Question:  Given that the Small Business Past Performance is either acceptable or unacceptable in the evaluation criteria, can the Government clarify how 'additional credit' is computed (given) and incorporated into the evaluation process for the Small Business Past Performance? <br>R85. This reference has been removed   Additional response: In accordance with Section M 3 (b) "enforceable commitments will be weighed more heavily than non-enforceable ones" <br><br>Q92.  Reference:  In Section L, 2 c on page 3, it states that "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Executive Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion." It continues to describe on the next page the "Narrative discussion" as consisting of the information for each separate task which we know from Table 2 on page 3 to be limited to 80 pages. <br>Question:  It is then assumed that the Table of Contents and Executive Summary Section do not count in this page limit. Is our understanding correct? <br>R92. Correct, the executive Summary and Table of Contents do not count as part of the overall page count.  Also see Question/Response #4 above.<br><br>Q95.  Reference:  Price evaluation: Part 2.c.(iv) page 9 explicitly states that "Offerors prices proposed for the Sample Tasks will only be used for evaluation purposes." Some offerors will interpret this to mean that proposed sample Task Order pricing is not binding, and will propose unrealistically low STO pricing in order to be more favorably evaluated. While these unrealistic prices may result in a more favorable evaluation, this offeror could not possibly use this pricing to successfully perform the STO. The draft section L&M pricing (part 4.(b) page 17) evaluation scheme outlined to determine Cost Realism will serve to mitigate this to some degree.<br>Comment:  It is recommend that STO pricing be binding in order to ensure that the government receives reasonable and realistic pricing to evaluate. <br>R95. The pricing will not be binding . <br><br>Q98.  Reference:  Page 17, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, Page 19, Section M.C.4.b Price/Cost Evaluation Approach Section, last table <br>Question:  The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) formula does not seem to be the same as the last table on page 19. The description of the TEP on page 17 states that the proposed price of each Sample task will be multiplied by the anticipated # of Dos/TOs and summed to equal the Total Evaluated Price. The final table on page 19 indicates that the sum of the three Sample Tasks will be the Total Evaluated Price. Will the government please clarify which is correct? <br>R98.  The table at the end of section M has been removed. <br><br><br>Q105.  Reference:  Pages 6 and 7, para 2c(iii). <br>Question:  In subparagraph e, do we list the data for all of our teammates, or only those utilized in the three sample tasks?<br>R105. The Government expects teammates listed as part of the proposal submission to include all possible teammates.  As such the Government expects the same teammates will be utilized to bid on future DO/TOs under this contract vehicle. <br><br>Q111.  Reference:  Page10, para 2c(iv)iv, Subcontracts/Interdivisional Effort.<br>Question:  Will the Government reconsider the requirement to perform CAPA on Interdivisional pricing data?  Regulatory requirements are not currently present in the FAR to conduct CAPA on Interdivisional efforts nor are Interdivisional efforts characterized as subcontracts in the FAR.  The FAR requires prime contractors to perform cost or price analyses on subcontracts but doesn't extend these regulatory requirements to interdivisional efforts.<br>R111.

<DESC>Date: 28 Feb 2012 - Mod solicitation site from FedBid to e-buy.	
This is a pre-solicitation notice for Foam Insulation Installation Services in accordance with FAR Part 5.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Birmingham Veteran Affairs Medical Center (BVAMC), 700 S. 19th Street, Birmingham, AL 35233 is seeking sources for  a potential contract to provide injected foam insulation services at the Tuscaloosa Medical Centers located at 3701 Loop Road, East, Tuscaloosa, AL 35404.   The finished installation restores thermal efficiency; prolongs the life of piping systems; prevents ground water intrusion; and eliminates visible steam vapor on campus.  The process shall create minimal disruption during application and the steam system shall remain in service during application.  The intended contract is anticipated for a one time buy of services required.
Anticipated Award date is 2 April 2012.  Field Investigations, demolition, and installation shall generally begin within 45 days of contract award and substantial/final completion shall be accomplished within 175 days after start of work.
Transmittal. Transmissions to the GPE must be in accordance with the interface description available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.
Contract Line Item Number:  
CLIN 0001 Installation by injection approx 1,452 LF of foam insulation into steam trenches and rickwil system.  Quantity of 1 job.

The successful offeror must provide all labor, trained technicians, supervision, warehousing, materials, travel, mobilization, subsistence, consumable supplies, pumping/metering equipment and chemicals to inject a high-temperature, rigid polyisocyanurate foam into the concrete trenches that currently house steam and condensate piping.  Such foam insulation shall be capable of withstanding 400F in continuous service and 450F in intermittent/peak service.

The injected formulation (Condufill or equal) must be non-hazardous and shall expand to a volumetric ratio of not less than 30 to 1, filling all voids between the surface of the interior conduit surface and the insulated (or hot surface) of its internal piping.  The formulation shall have a nominal density of 3.5 lbs/ft, a K-Factor of .18 btu/inch/hr-ft-degree F, a water absorption rate of < 2%, a closed-cell content of >95%, a compressive strength no greater than 17.5 psi and a dimensional stability of not less than -0.20%.  The successful offeror shall furnish certified laboratory test data verifying that the proposed product meets these requirements.

The process of injecting the flowable rigid insulation into the steam trenches shall be conducted while the steam piping is operating and at standard steam system operating temperatures. Access ports necessary for the injection of the chemical components shall be provided by means of air-vacuum excavation equipment in order to minimize disruption to the surfaces above the steam trenches.  

Entry through the surface of the metal/concrete conduits, and cutting of such conduits to access the target voids shall be made by torches, grinders or diamond core drill bits.  Injection shall be made through tubing that is capable of withstanding standard steam system operating temperatures and the voids shall be completely filled with the expanding high-temperature foam insulation.  All street, sidewalk and other ground surfaces penetrated to gain access to the steam trenches shall be fully restored to their original condition following the injection process.

The following four tasks are required:

1. Thermally repair the following sections of concrete steam trenches that currently house steam or condensate piping on the Tuscaloosa VAMC campus (the standard trench configuration is 24 inches by 36 inches): 
	
Between Bldg#18 and Bldg #3 (approx. 150 LF of 4 HPS and 2 CR)
Between Bldg #3 and Bldg #5 (approx. 460 LF of 6 HPS and 2 CR)
Between Bldg #12 and Bldg #17 (approx. 80 LF of 2 LPS and 1.5 DCR)
Between Bldg #39 and Bldg #40 (approx.125 LF of 4 MPS, 2.5 CR and 1.5 DCR)
Between Bldg #40 and Bldg #33 (approx. 170 LF of 6 MPS and 2 CR)
Between MH#41 (north) to Bldg #12 (approx. 320 LF of 6 MPS and 2 CR)
Bldg #41 to MH#41 (approx. 85 LF of 2.5 MPS and 1.25 CR)
Bldg #33 to MH#41 (approx. 60 LF of 6 MPS, 2 CR and 1 DCR)

2. Thermally repair insulation with conduit from Bldg #3 to MH#1 Ricwil (approximately 520 LF of 6HPS in 14diameter steel casing).  Access the Ricwil system from MH#1 and from non-intrusive vacuum digs above the line. All access points to the concrete conduit will be by air-vacuum excavation equipment and each dig will be temporarily shored with 12 schedule 40 PVC pipe.  Accessing Ricwil piping from above ground is labor intensive and requires an excavation every 10 feet along the line.  

3. The successful offeror shall measure, design, manufacture, and install custom-made Removable Insulation Covers (RIC) for all applicable steam piping in MH#1, MH#3, MH#5 and MH#41. This will include stripping of existing and disposing of insulation in MH#3, MH#5 and MH#4.  Asbestos remediation is not included and shall be the VAs responsibility.  These RICs will be specially fabricated with a grey LFP 2109 PTFE-coated outer jacketing and a hydrophobic 20 mm Pyrogel XT insulation mat that is designed to repel water in flood-prone manhole environments. 

4. The successful offeror shall install (via cold tap method) three (3) steam driven Sump Ejector Pumps for Tuscaloosa VA in 3 vaults (MH#1, MH#3, and MH#41).  Asbestos remediation is not included and will be the VAs responsibility.  
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency and posted on e-buy under VA247-12-R-0024 on 15 March 2012.

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Response Date for the RFI is changed to June 30, 2012 at 4:00pm EST.</strong><br /></span><br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not at this time seeking proposals. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov). Interested parties are advised to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>This RFI seeks to obtain information from industry that will provide CBP with insight into existing technology that can be fielded now as well as technological advances that might be expected in the near future (3-8 years out). RFI responses will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for technology solutions required to address all CBP mission areas. These mission areas include: screening of passengers and conveyances for contraband at ports of entry; intelligence collection and analysis; and supporting functions such as officer safety and training. This is a partial listing. A more complete listing is provided as Potential User Needs in Appendix A, Definitions in Appendix B.</p>
<p>To address this planning, CBP is creating a Technology Development Roadmap (Tech Roadmap) that captures the Potential User Needs of all CBP operational components, assesses the capability of existing and near term technology to meet those Potential User Needs, and identifies all gaps between them.</p>
<p>Once established, this Tech Roadmap will help guide CBP's future acquisitions and support new product development. It will identify which Potential User Needs can be met immediately with Off-the-Shelf products, which solutions would have the greatest impact on the mission once implemented, and which projects require further development.</p>
<p>In order to effectively populate the Tech Roadmap, information is needed from industry that allows us to assess the state of the technology readiness level of products that may be able to fulfill the Potential User Needs of CBP.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is <br />541712- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology) Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background<br />Human infections with avian influenza A (H5N1) are associated with high mortality. As of July 5, 2010 there had been 500 cases and 296 fatalities. The influenza virus readily undergoes mutation and re-assortment, and there are concerns that an H5N1 variant could be responsible for a future pandemic. The influenza neuraminidase inhibitors Zanamivir and Oseltamivir are approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is being used to treat H5N1 infections and a case has been made supporting the use of Zanamivir also; however, there are no reports for the latter. Despite treatments with early use of oseltamivir combined with supportive care as suggested by WHO, 30% to 80% of hospitalized patients with H5N1 influenza have died, and an oseltamivir-resistant virus has developed in some patients.</p>
<p>Although the majority of patients infected by pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus had a mild illness, severe diseases and mortality occurred in those with extremes of age, immunosuppression, obesity, pregnancy, and other underlying illnesses. Patients with mild illness fared well with the early use of neuraminidase inhibitors. However, the usefulness of these antiviral agents in treating patients with severe illness is uncertain. Despite the use of double-dose oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, patients with severe illness had delayed clearance of viral load in respiratory secretions, associated with persistent elevation of cytokines in their serum samples. Thus, there is an urgent need to find alternative therapeutic regimens for managing this subgroup of patients. Robust protection from lethality for at least 72 hours after infection was demonstrated for monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing activity produced by immortalized B lymphocytes of convalescent patients recovering from influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in a murine model challenged by the hypervirulent influenza A (H5N1) virus. Furthermore, meta-analysis on studies using convalescent blood products in the 1918 influenza pandemic suggested that such an approach could reduce the mortality rate of severe cases by &gt; 50%.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The study deals with measuring the neutralizing ability of neutralized antibody in plasma. Based on published reports, plasma from patients can neutralize influenza.<br />LMV plans to verify this using ferrets infected with influenza virus, H5N1 and H1N1. To understand the duration of viremia and whether / how convalescent plasma treatment reduces mortality and improve the recovery of patients infected with H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, LMV plans to study viremia and disease pathogenesis of H5N1 virus and pandemic H1N1 virus infection in the susceptible ferret animal model.</p>
<p>To examine blood safety and virus neutralization by convalescent plasma, ferrets will be inoculated intranasally with one ml of H5N1 virus containing 500 &micro;l to each nare with one times of EID50. Plasma, which will be collected from the ferrets by the contractor on day0, day30, day60, day120, or day180 post-infection, will be given to ferrets separately, on day 2 post-infection. Clinical signs of infection, weight, and temperatures are to be recorded daily by the contractor. In addition, virus load in lung, brain, ileum, nasal turbinate, nasal wash and blood, and cytokines in blood will be tested that at the contractor's BSL3 facility. The contractor will also measure viral RNA in blood one or two days before death.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>

<SUBJECT>The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Regional Vendor Model
<SOLNBR>AG-3198-S-12-0504
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>031412
<CONTACT>RICHARD  HICKS, Contracting Officer, Phone 7033052261, Fax 7033052071, Email richard.hicks@fns.usda.gov - PAMELA MARTIN , Contract Specialist, Phone 7036051568, Fax 7033052071, Email pamela.martin@fns.usda.gov
<DESC><p>Request for Information for FDPIR Pilot Project<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for Request for Proposals but instead a Request for Information to solicit constructive feedback from Industry on the government's draft solicitation documents for a new Pilot project for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This valuable information will assist the government in finalizing a comprehensive solicitation package scheduled for FBO release late March 2012. <br /><br />Project Background: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS) mission is to reduce hunger and food insecurity, in partnership with cooperating organizations, by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture. FNS achieves this mission by administering USDA's 15 domestic nutrition assistance programs. <br /><br />Among those programs is FDPIR, which provides food to low income households living on Indian reservations and Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations. FDPIR was established as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) because such areas often do not have easy access to grocery stores. <br /><br />Under FDPIR's current food distribution model, USDA buys food, which is sent to two USDA-contracted warehouses, both in Missouri. From there, food is distributed to ITOs and State agencies that administer FDPIR. This is known as the National Warehouse Model. The National Warehouse Model is not ideal because it does not provide sufficient opportunities to incorporate local and traditional foods into the FDPIR food package and has high costs associated with the centralized storage and trans-national transportation of food.<br /><br />Additionally, sites also receive fresh fruits and vegetables delivered by the Department of Defense. However, this Program will not be part of the Pilot and will continue as currently operated.<br /><br />FNS intends to pilot a Regional Distribution Model, starting in calendar year 2012. FNS will select a limited number of ITOs to participate in this Pilot, which will be "grouped" in one geographic area. There are several natural "Groupings" of ITOs throughout the nation.<br /><br />Under the proposed Pilot, USDA would contract with a vendor, which would service the Grouping selected to participate in the Pilot. Specifically, the vendor would buy USDA-approved items and distribute them directly to the ITOs, which would then prepare and distribute FDPIR food packages to program participants. This would be known as the Regional Vendor Pilot (RVP), or the Pilot.<br /><br />To be successful, the vendor selected for the Pilot must (at minimum) successfully and consistently (1) accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs and Tribes, (2) deliver those foods to those organizations, (3) according to a negotiated schedule, (4) in good condition and (5) be cost-effective. <br /><br />Other anticipated benefits of the Pilot include (1) incorporation of traditional foods into the FDPIR food package, (2) greater opportunity to purchase foods from Native American producers, and (3) improved customer service for FDPIR organizations and program participants.<br /><br />FNS has drafted the following Performance-based acquisition documents meeting the government's objectives for the Pilot as follows: (1) Statement of Objectives (SOO) by which offerors will respond and from which offerors will develop their Statement of Work and Quality Assurance Plan including Performance Metrics, (2) Evaluation factors, and (3) Pricing structure. <br /><br />The government anticipates awarding one 5-year firm fixed price contract with economic price adjustments in food and fuel costs. Year one of the contract will deploy the Pilot and, if deemed successful in comparison to the performance and costs of the current Warehouse Model, including food costs, continue to increase deployment in option years 1 through 4. The expectation is to have a Nation-wide FDPIR food delivery contract by Year 5. Additionally, the government intends to make award based on best value with technical having paramount consideration over cost. Large businesses will be required to submit a negotiated subcontracting plan that will meet, to the extent practicable, the government's minimum 2012 small business goals.<br /><br />Purpose of Notice: The purpose of this notice is to receive constructive feedback from Industry on the government's Performance-based acquisition documents to determine if the structure is (1) feasible for Industry to prepare a comprehensive proposal, and (2) consistent with Industry best practices for pricing food and transportation costs, including bi-annual EPAs based on price indices.<br /><br />It is not the government's intent to completely modify its current performance-based acquisition model but to ensure that sufficient and accurate information is captured in order for the government to receive comprehensive proposals containing accurate pricing information. Vendors are asked to read the attached documents carefully to fully understand the government's requirements and respond accordingly. Your insight and feedback is valuable to FNS to ensure release of a Request for Proposals ensures competition to the maximum extent practicable.<br /><br />Vendor Responses: Interested firms shall respond by providing answers or recommended changes to the following documents:<br /><br />1) Does the draft SOO contain sufficient information for offerors to respond in years 1 through 5? If not, what other data do you recommend should be included? <br /><br />2) Are the evaluation factors clear and concise for offerors to respond? If not, what other factors do you recommend should be included?<br /><br />3) Does the pricing structure contain sufficient information for offerors to provide fixed unit food prices, overhead/administrative fees/profit and a total fixed unit price? Is it feasible for transportation costs to be a separate line item? If not, how should transportation cost be priced? Provide a thorough rationale to support recommended structure for transportation costs.<br /><br />4) Is it feasible for EPAs to be implemented every 6 months? If not, recommend the frequency and provide a thorough rationale to support the recommendation. <br /><br />5) Is it feasible for unit food prices to remain constant in option years 2 - 5 with the EPA dictating unit prices upwards or downwards? If not, provide a thorough rationale to support the recommended structure.<br /><br />6) Can the government expect quantity discounts as food commodities increase across the 5 year contract life? What other discounts, if any, can the government assume?<br /><br />7) Is the number of pages, for each evaluation factor, sufficient to prepare a comprehensive response? If not, what are the minimum number of pages would you recommend for each factor, keeping in mind a streamlined not voluminous proposal? <br /><br />8) Others?<br /><br />This is a request for information only. The government will not pay for the information prepared or submitted in response to this notice. Vendors interested in this procurement are advised to peruse FBOs for the solicitation's release. Further, the government is not interested in voluminous or marketing data in response to this request. Vendors are asked to respond only to the questions and other information relevant to this notice.<br /><br />Responses are due NLT 2 p.m. March 14, 2012 via e-mail to Richard Hicks, Contracting Officer, at Richard.hicks@fns.usda.gov. FNS is not soliciting questions as part of this Request for Information. However, the Contracting Officer is interested in any other questions, comments or concerns potential offerors may have on this effort for the government's consideration.</p>

<DESC>The North Idaho/Montana Acquisition Team anticipates awarding&nbsp;the South Township Integrated Resource Stewardship Contract (IRSC)&nbsp;for work on the Red River Ranger District of the Nez Perce National Forest and on lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, Cottonwood Field Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal law that authorizes&nbsp;the Forest Service to enter into "Stewardship" contracts is unique in that it allows to Forest Service to apply the value of timber removed as an offset against the cost of services received.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract area includes the American River and Red River drainages just south of the town of Elk City, Idaho. The South Township project is primarily a hazardous fuels reduction project with sawtimber and non-sawtimber removal from approximately 169 acres with approximately 1.1 mile of temporary road construction and obliteration in order to facilitate timber removal. Estimated sawtimber volume is 4948 tons. Estimated non-sawtimber is 5560 tons.&nbsp;Complete details regarding volume and timber sale roadwork specifications&nbsp;are available&nbsp;in the solicitation. The service work for this stewardship project requires reconstruction of approximately 2.79 miles of access road. Estimated price range for the construction work is $25,000-$100,000.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<p>The complete solicitation was posted on this website March 6, 2012 along with all attachments referenced in Section J as well as a letter to interested vendors describing the Stewardship contracting process.&nbsp; This letter also&nbsp;provides general project information and instructions for&nbsp;vendors&nbsp;who may be unfamiliar with the procurement process. A pre-proposal conference will be held at the&nbsp;Nez Perce National Forest Supervisor's&nbsp;Office at&nbsp;104 Airport Road&nbsp;in Grangeville, Idaho.

A contract may not be awarded as a result of this announcement. <br><br>The purpose of this 'Sources Sought/Market Survey' is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and to develop additional knowledge of the existing market for the required services. Feedback on individual submissions will not be provided. <br><br>Capability Packages:<br><br>Small businesses are encouraged to submit capability packages; however, the size of this acquisition is anticipated to exceed the established small business size threshold for the NAICS codes determined to be appropriate for this requirement.  Interested small business concerns that are qualified as a HUBZone, or other small business categories in NAICS code 541611 with a size standard of $7,000,000.00 are encouraged to submit their capability packages.  The Government reserves the right to reserve any portion of this requirement for Small Business Concerns and will maintain a list of interested and qualified entities.<br><br>Businesses having the ability to provide the services listed in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement shall provide clear and comprehensive information supporting their experience, expertise, and current company profile to include the number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE code, small business designation/status claimed and annual revenue. Furthermore, responses should identify the specific task areas in Section 5.0 that the organization is capable of performing. The capability packages for this 'sources sought/market survey' are not expected to be proposals, but rather statements regarding the company's existing experience in relation to the areas specified in the PWS.   <br><br><br>Capability Packages should clearly address the following areas:<br><br>1. Technical understanding of the work: The National Guard Bureau (NGB), the representative agency for the National Guard (NG), a reserve component of the U.S Department of Defense (DOD) has the urgent need to provide mental health support services per provision 10 U.S.C., Chapter 55; Section 723, National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007, Pub. L. 109-163 and the Report of the DOD Task Force on Mental Health (TFMH), June 2007, specifically behavioral health and support services for NG Service Members as part of pre-deployment resiliency training and post deployment reintegration to civilian life.10 U.S.C., Chapter 55 establishes: federal responsibility for Prevention, Mitigation, and Treatment of Blast Injuries (Pub. L. 109-163 (1) (D); Access to Health Care Services for Beneficiaries Eligible for TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care (Pub. L. 107-314, (A), (C); Health Care Management Demonstration Program (Pub. L. 106-398, (a), (b, 1-2),  specifically to improve, develop and maintain intervention and rehabilitation programs for returning troops who have developed post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), experienced traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and/or other behavioral health problems associated with an individual's inability to reintegrate into civilian life. Some states and local communities currently lack access, coordination and/or professional intervention services of mental health providers and related support systems. The NG faces unique challenges to provide mental health support to its Service Members. NG Armories and Wings are community based and are seldom within the catchment area of a military treatment facility; and have varying degrees of capabilities between communities and states. Since the NG does not provide treatment, all treatment is received externally through the Military Health System, TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration (VA), health insurance provided through a NG Service Member's or civilian spouse's civilian employer, and personal finances.  Additionally, psychological health is not a standardized program of the NG, resulting in an inconsistency between psychological health needs and a state's/territory's ability to design and implement a psychological health program.  This contract also addresses the recommendations: 5.4.1.6, 5.4.1.10, 5.4.1.11, 5.4.1.12, 5.4.1.14 of the DOD Plan to Achieve the Vision of the DOD Task Force on Mental Health, September 2007 Report to Congress; "to place a Director of Psychological Health at each of the 54 Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ)", for Army National Guard (ARNG) and Air National Guard (ANG), under direction of the state Adjutant General (TAG) who may appoint a Joint Director for oversight.  Based on a NG underlying principle that no Service Member will be left behind, the PH services to be delivered under this contract are NG Service Member based psychological health services designed to help achieve and maintain NG Service Members' readiness for deployment, and to help members address the full range of behavioral and mental health problems developed during deployment as a means of facilitating reentry to civilian life.  Services are to be part of a comprehensive overall effort to support Service Member readiness and better cope with the sequelae of TBI and/or PTSD. They are to decrease the stigma associated with seeking mental health services as well as improve access to qualified mental health providers at the critical point, when a NG Service Member or dependent recognizes the need for mental health intervention.  PWS sections 1.8 and 5.<br><br>2.  Key Personnel: Do the key staff members have the analytical, functional and technical knowledge/ experience directly related to tasks outlined in the PWS; have sufficient resources on hand and available to begin work on the effort; have or have the ability to obtain a minimum of a secret clearance? Demonstrate technical knowledge, experience, and understanding of behavioral health relevant to accomplish the required service. PWS sections 1.8-1.8.6.<br><br>3.  Past Performance:  Do you have specific past performance and experience with staffing behavioral health personnel or similar work equivalent to PWS tasks? The Contractor is to be knowledgeable of the range and scope of other NG, DOD, Army, and Air Force programs and services appropriate for meeting client needs, including the additional military eligibilities available when Service Members are activated.  The Contractor also will assure that the DPH within a State, territory or Wing is connecting with other federal, state, local and community based programs to assure that all possible resources are leveraged and that all Service Members' needs are met.  The Contractor will refer and connect clients with military resources when eligible for them and with other resources as clinically and financially appropriate. PWS sections 1.4-1.5 and PWS section 5.<br><br>4.  Knowledge of Specific Technical Requirements: The purpose of this contract is to deliver PH support services, designed for effective delivery within the National Guard structure and culture. The Contractor will identify and provide Directors of Psychological Health (DPHs) in the states/territories and at additional locations as to be outlined in the future. DPHs will be responsible for design and delivery of PH services tailored to local unique needs.  At the discretion of the Command at each location and with approval by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), they also will administratively manage various NG programs and directives related to PH services to ensure effective integrated comprehensive services meeting Service Members' needs.  Services will be delivered throughout the United States including the District of Columbia, Pacific Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wherever Army or Air National Guard Service Members and their dependents are located. As part of their proposals, offerors are requested to consider the services to be delivered and to describe the offeror's recent experience both at the corporate and the state level in: working with customer organizations to understand and meet their needs; demonstrating value relative to psychological health core competencies; demonstrating outcomes from the services delivered; and in demonstrating overall Return On Investment for the National Guard.  Offerors also are requested to describe as part of their proposal how the offeror, if awarded this contract, at both the corporate, Wing and State level, would work with NGB, the wings, states and territories, to accomplish the four functions listed in the above paragraph. PWS section 5, specific tasks.<br><br>A draft PWS is attached for your information.  This document is not in final form and is subject to change.<br><br>In addition, the following questions must be answered and elaborated on as part of the package:  <br><br>(1) Financial Capability- Does your firm have the financial capability to withstand a negative cash flow of at least ($30,000.00) per month? <br><br>(2) Past Performance- Does your firm have relevant past performance experience within the last three years? <br><br>(3) Corporate Experience- Does your firm have the work experience similar in nature, scope, complexity, value and difficulty of work in the PWS? <br>Interested parties should submit the information requested above by 29 March 2012, 12:00 pm EDT to michael.s.wade@us.army.mil. Please include company name, address, telephone number, and technical point of contact, brochures/literature. Capability packages must not exceed 30 pages (12 point font with one-inch borders, not including pictures, brochures and Market Survey), must be submitted electronically and should clearly indicate whether the organization is able to provide the services listed in the Draft Performance Work Statement. All contractor questions must be submitted no later than 12:00 PM EDT on Thursday, 15 March 2012 to the contract specialist, CPT Michael S. Wade at e-mail: michael.s.wade@us.army.mil. Telephone calls regarding this notice will not be accepted. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether there are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, sponsors, and directs national and international extramural research programs involving the testing of vaccines, therapeutics, and prevention modalities. Through these programs, clinical trials in over 28 countries at more than 300 clinical research sites are supported.</p>
<p>NIAID places a very high priority on ensuring the integrity of study endpoint and safety data. The quality and integrity of clinical study products is a cornerstone of patient safety and study data. The purpose of this contract is to continue to provide a broad range of pharmaceutical and study product management services to the current and evolving NIAID/DAIDS supported clinical research portfolio. This includes the clinical trials networks of DAIDS, as well as some non-network studies. In addition, this contract will support the clinical site pharmacy oversight responsibilities of the Division of AIDS.</p>
<p>The Clinical Research Products Management Center (CRPMC) contract was initially awarded in 1988 and has been renewed at the expiration of each contract period (the current contract number is HHSN266200600002C with Fisher Bioservices, Inc., Rockville, Maryland).</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />This contract will support the continuation of cognitive pharmaceutical services including evaluating draft protocols; reviewing site pharmacy monitoring reports, and maintaining a site audit pharmacy report database; providing study product storage and stability information, guidance in research pharmacy practice and study product management activities to clinical site pharmacists; and conducting Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) audits of manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the CRPMC will provide technical expertise for the receipt of study products; storage under cGMP; validate containers for the shipment of study products; evaluate orders, and distribute study products; design and labeling of study products and product kits; packaging and repackaging of study products under GMP; monitor product inventories and expiration dates; recall and process of study product returns, and maintain a database to track study product activities. The CRPMC will train staff in critical procedures and under limited circumstances, purchase drugs. Options are included to accommodate additional work in support of pharmacy oversight responsibilities, as well as for the provision of limited study product management functions for the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) in the areas of drug acquisition/sourcing, study product storage, and shipment/distribution</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The CRPMC must have the capabilities to carry out the scope of work both domestically within the United States (U.S.) and internationally, including countries in Africa, Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and Europe. All functions must be conducted in accordance with federal, local and international regulations governing study products. For the purposes of determining your related capabilities, you may assume that this contract will be required per year to repackage 25 different study products consisting of 50,000 individual units, label 200 different study products consisting of 150,000 individual units, and process approximately 12,000 shipments within the U.S. and internationally.</p>

The option periods may extend the term of the contract beyond the base period for up to 7 years. In addition to the services outlined above to be provided in the base requirement, options for additional services under the contract may be exercised at the discretion of the Government as follows: 1) increased level of effort to accommodate significant increases in work in the amount of 2.25 FTEs per option that may be exercised up to two times in a performance year; 2) increased level of effort to support pharmacy oversight responsibilities in the amount of 2.25 FTEs per option that may be exercised up to two times in a performance year; and 3) increased level of effort to provide limited study product management functions to the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) in the amount of 2 FTEs per option that may be exercised one time per performance year. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources as stated above.</p>

Question: Page 4 of the cost instructions (Attachment 11), requests labor rates for On&#8208;site and Off&#8208;site responses; however, the cost tables in Section B do not include a request for two sets of rates. In 2006, RFP Mod 2 removed this requirement, so we assume the government would like only a single rate for each labor category. Please clarify.
Answer: The offeror shall submit one (1) fully burdened set of rates for all response.
Question: Page 5 of Section B references a Section H clause entitled ?Performance Based Task Orders?; however, there is no Section H clause with that specific title.TAnswer: The language in section B which refers to ?Performance Based Task Orders? has been removed.
Question: Regarding, Page 6 of the cost instructions (Attachment 11) Table&#8208;3 Equipment Rates, would thegovernment consider removing this requirement because it will be difficult to evaluate offerors withdiffering equipment lists? In 2006, RFP Mod 2 removed this requirement.
Answer: Table&#8208; 3 Equipment Rate has been removed.
Question: Regarding the cost instructions, the previous DATS RFP included an instruction to include a 50% additional capacity of labor and ODCs to allow for costs associated with emergency response. This was added during the questions and answers with offerors. Will the government consider adding this typeof instruction to this solicitation?
Amswer: The new DATS contract will not have any additional capacity.

<DESC><br />CARBAMATE INSECTICIDES FOR INDOOR RESIDUAL SPRAYING (IRS) IN ETHIOPIA<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NUMBER RFI-663-12-00001<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The United States Agency for International Development in Ethiopia (USAID/Ethiopia), is seeking information from the market to identify potential offerors with demonstrated capability to fulfill the agency's requirement. This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. <br />Under the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), USAID/Ethiopia has plans for award of a new contract in an amount of $3 to $4 million for purchase between 120,000kg to 150,000kg of insecticide for indoor residual spraying of household activities and packed in 250g/pack. Since 2007, the U.S. Government has supported malaria prevention and control activities in Ethiopia through PMI [http://www.pmi.gov]. IRS represents one of the main prevention and control activities supported by PMI. For the 2012 IRS activities, USAID/Ethiopia has planned to procure one or more of WHOPES approved carbamate class insecticides for indoor residual insecticide spray activities namely: propoxur or bendiocarb. This is to support specifically IRS activities in Oromia Regional State of Ethiopia. The insecticide is required to be in country ready for use by June 30, 2012. However, USAID/Ethiopia is experiencing unforeseen delays in commencing the procurement process which may lead to imposition of restrictive lead times for acquiring the insecticides. If a decision to proceed with the procurement is made, currently USAID/Ethiopia anticipates awarding the contract by April 30, 2012. This RFI is being issued to determine whether or not there are qualified sources that will be able to meet this requirement (i.e. product availability and supply with very short delivery schedules).<br />The information obtained from this RFI will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the acquisition plan for this requirement, which may eventually result in a Government contractual action.<br />Interested parties are invited to submit a capability statement along with their company profile to include:<br />1) Information demonstrating that their company has the capability to successfully delivery this project. The offeror should be familiar with this type of work and should have done it before.<br />2) Type of carbamate insecticide and formulation that the offeror can supply<br />3) Least lead time the offeror requires to deliver the insecticide to Ethiopia.<br />4) Company name, company mail address, point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, DUNS number.<br />5) Information indicating similar contracts your firm has successfully completed as a prime contractor. The government is looking for Prime Contractor experience only.<br />6) Provide information of your firm's ability to execute projects in geographical, political, cultural and political context similar to Ethiopia. <br />The capability statement should not exceed 5 pages and should be submitted as e-mail attachment to Snagwere@usaid.gov with a copy to Gtaitt@usaid.gov not later than March 12, 2012. No telephonic submissions will be honored.<br />This RFI is a market research tool only, and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. No Solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. Responses to this RFI notice will be treated as information only; they do not constitute offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. RFI responses will not be returned; neither will Respondents be notified of the Government's consideration of the information received. Respondents are advised that USAID is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.

<DESC><br />1. Contracting Activity: DMEA/ MEE (Contracting)
<p>2. Description of Action: DMEA works cooperatively with industry, academia, and other laboratories to leverage technology developments from all sectors for advancement of both the domestic economy and DMEA's technological capabilities. A mainstay in that approach is the use of partnership intermediary (PI) services for assisting the DMEA T2 activities, in accordance with DoD Instruction 5535.8 (Domestic Technology Program) and 15 USC 3715 (Use of Partnership Intermediaries). A Cost Type (no fee) contract, using R&amp;D funds (0400), is anticipated for this requirement.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: The contractor shall perform the actions as defined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and provide requisite technical and managerial reports detailing strategies, plans, actions and outcomes of technology transfer as defined in the SOW.<br />A. The contractor shall provide the deliverables identified in the SOW.<br />B. Total estimated cost of a contract with one base year and four one year options is $2,142,851.</p>
<p>4. Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6-302-3 (a)(2)(ii) Industrial Mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services.</p>
<p>5. Reason for Authority Cited:</p>
<p>A. The Federal Technology Center (FTC), Inc. is the only regional, nonprofit institution that has the expertise to provide development capabilities for productive Technology Transfer Partnerships. Furthermore, the contractor shall assist DMEA with the implementation and exchange of transfer mechanisms, e.g. CRADAs, CTAs, EPAs, in order to maintain our domestic, microelectronics capabilities.</p>
<p><br />B. The FTC was established under the guidelines of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. This includes 15 USC 3715 (Use of partnership intermediaries), which identifies partnership intermediaries (PI) as entities that are operated on behalf of a State or local government. In this case, the FTC, as a non-profit entity, which works with the Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD). LRCCD provides the only Small Business Development Center (SBDC) established for the greater Sacramento region to assist the establishment and development of regional small businesses, the Golden State SBDC. The FTC operates the only Northern California Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) program to assist California small business with Federal, State and Local Government contracting, including technology transfer opportunities. The FTC conducts Federal, State and Local Government contracting training and consulting for small business at the Golden State SBDC and other SBDCs throughout the state. This provides the FTC unequalled exposure to small businesses that may be suitable technology partners or contractors for DMEA.</p>

<DESC>1. Contracting Activity: DMEA/MEE(Contracting) 2. Description of Action: The purpose of this J&amp;A is to provide software upgrades and software support for the existing DMEA Mentor Graphics Design Environment at other than full and open competition procedures. This SW design tool suite is in support of the DMEA mission and advanced microelectronics technology application programs.3. Description of Supplies/Services: a. The contractor shall provide software upgrades and software support for the DMEA Mentor Graphics Design Environment residing in Building 620, Room 134. Mentor Graphics is an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) company that integrates various applications and tools in a single framework to support all the stages of IC design and verification. These tools support different fabrication technologies within DMEA and external to DMEA. Additionally, the Mentor Graphics toolset is the primary software tool that is used to support various process design kit (PDK) development and design verification in nanometer technologies. b. Estimated Cost: $161,225.00 per year for Software (SW) Maintenance Renewal with an option for Year 2. The primary increase in the cost of the software maintenance is due to the purchase of new tools such as the Mentor Graphics's Calibre DRC, LVS and Parasitic Extraction toolset. FFP contract. Year 1 $161,462.00 Year 2 option $161,462.00.4. Authority Cited: This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.5. Reason for Authority Cited: This requirement cannot be competed because the DMEA Mentor Graphics Design Environment, an existing system, is proprietary, one-of-a-kind design and simulation tools suite, and it would take an exorbitant amount of expense and time to completely change to another vendor design environment. Conversion of existing designs to a different tool suite would incur a minimum schedule slip of 36 months at best and the engineering labor costs of 4 software engineers (2087 hrs per year * $120 per hour * 4PE * 3Years = $3,005,280). The magnitude of this schedule slip will result in the failure of the DMEA mission and meeting the needs of customers. The cost of the toolset would exceed $3M. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: This acquisition will be advertised on the Federal Business Opportunities (FebBizOpps) website. At this time, no other sources have been identified who have the capabilities required to meet the requirements identified in the Performance Specification.8. Market Research: The market research that was conducted used the following elements to make our determination: a. Contacted knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry regarding market capabilities to meet requirements. b. Reviewed catalogs and other generally available product literature published by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers or available on-line. 9. Other Facts: To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. The notice required by FAR 5.201 shall be published and any proposals received shall be considered. A contract was previously awarded to Mentor Graphics under DMEA H94003-08-C-0801.
