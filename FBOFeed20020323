<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative forensic science research and development projects.  There are six broad forensic areas:  explosives and arson, computer forensics, DNA, toolmarks, fingerprints, and trace evidence.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-914497.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set-aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102 (d) (2) (i).

<DESC>USDA, ARS, SAA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Industrial Microwave Systems, Inc, to provide one small scale industrial microwave planar dryer for heating and drying of foodstuffs.  Equipment is needed to continue studies of microwave drying using microwave technology resulting in uniform application of microwave energy evenly across materials on a moving belt.  The equipment must duplicate characteristics and conditions of equipment previously used in microwave studies conducted by unit personnel at Industrial Microwave Systems, Inc.  Extensive studies conducted over two years require exacting equipment to guarantee duplication of previous conditions in the conduct of future studies.  The industrial microwave required must generate uniform microwave energy for heating of foodstuffs.  The microwave system must have a continuous planar belt applicator and air handling system to control duration of exposure of samples to microwave energy and removal of moisture lost from samples.  Microwave energy output must be controllable so that temperatures and drying times may be controlled to within a few degrees.  Additional required controls include: system must be compatible with a 5 KW 915 MHz generator and control system that is currently used in the NCSU Food Science Department Aseptic Processing Laboratory.  Configuration of the dryer is critical and must be such that the generator may be bolted on without modification. System must be a portable 5KW based system and must meet at least the following criteria: feed rate up to 2,000 #/hr, belt speed up to 10 feet/minute by variable speed drive. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice.  It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available.  If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Industrial Microwave Systems, Inc. without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is April 12, 2002.
