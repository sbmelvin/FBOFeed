<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a final design and flight capable version of a Flight Electronics Unit (FEU).  The FEU will be used to control and acquire data from two (2) Quartz Crystal Microbalances placed on the Shuttle Orbiter Remote Manipulator System (RMS) as part of a Development Test Objective (DTO) on a future Space Shuttle flight. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in: (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  Under a previous contract (Purchase Order T-9340W), NASA JSC procured a preliminary design and prototype version of the FEU from Applied Physics Laboratory.  As such, employing any other vendor would require a significant schedule and cost impact to JSC as the other vendor worked to interpret and analyze the existing preliminary design.	The schedule impact is particularly critical as this DTO is targeted to fly on STS-118 in November 2003., and it has been determined that no other vendor can provide an FEU and meet the schedule for STS-118.  Given the above reasons, competition is impractical in that employing a vendor other than the Applied Physics Laboratory, would put the success of this DTO at extreme high risk in terms of schedule and cost. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Jaunary 8, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting information and descriptions (white papers) for cost-shared activities to address research that will complement and enhance pipeline safety.  White papers are not to exceed five pages per project and must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address.  Separate white papers must be submitted for each proposed project and multiple projects cannot be combined into a single white paper.

On April 23 and April 25, 2002, RSPA's Office of Pipeline Safety (RSPA/OPS) held two (2) briefings to provide additional information on the BAA process.  Interested parties may obtain more details on these briefings via the Pipeline Safety Research and Development (R&D) Internet Web site http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  The Internet Web site contains the presentation from the briefings, questions and answers from the briefings, and a list of potential bidders and others who requested that their contact information be made public.  

SPECIAL NOTE:  This announcement will be open through January 31, 2003, unless otherwise amended.  The purpose of the BAA is to solicit research projects to assure the long-term integrity and security of the nation's gas and hazardous liquid pipeline network.  A team of experts will review white papers submitted in response to this announcement and offerors will be advised accordingly, as the evaluation is completed.

SCOPE:  In November 2001, a RSPA/OPS Research & Development workshop brought together government agencies (Federal, State, local and international), research institutions, pipeline companies and their associations, standards organizations, and public representatives to begin development of a national pipeline safety research agenda.  The workshop description, speaker notes, and other documents of interest are on the Pipeline Safety R&D Internet Web site: http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  On March 28, 2002, RSPA issued the first of three BAAs aimed to address the major research areas highlighted by the November workshop.  The first BAA solicited white papers for Damage Prevention and Leak Detection research and development.  RSPA has awarded $1.6 million for seven research contracts focused on damage prevention and leak detection.  Additional information on these contracts can be found on the Pipeline Safety R&D Internet Web site.  RSPA issued a second BAA on June 5,2002, to solicit white papers for Enhanced Pipeline Operations, Controls, and Monitoring.  RSPA expects to award contracts in this research area in the near future and will post information on each award on our Pipeline Safety R&D Internet Web site.  This BAA solicits white papers for the final research area highlighted by the November 2001 workshop and several areas identified in the first and second BAA:

Improved Material Performance and Other Pipeline Safety Improvements:  Research in this area should focus on improving pipeline materials to extend the integrity and lifetime of installed pipelines and their various components.  Other areas of interest include research that will improve pipeline safety or reduce the cost of state-of-the-art pipeline safety activities.  Topics of interest include the following:

?	Damage and defect resistant materials - Advanced pipeline materials that will prevent corrosion, mitigate 3rd party damage, or are resistant to environmental factors like soil movement and moisture and will extend pipeline life and lower maintenance costs.  Examples of projects of interest include materials that will avoid or mitigate environmentally assisted damage, improved non-metallic liners for pipelines that have defects that threaten the structural integrity of the pipeline, and technical and economic justification methodologies for alternative pipe designs, including composite pipe. 

?	Higher grade/strength steel - Installation of thicker and higher strength steels may add to pipeline damage and defect resistance, but may be offset by complications in joint welding and pipe flexibility. Examples of projects of interest include decision-making protocols to optimize the use of higher grade/strength steels; technical basis for the use of higher grade/strength steels; improved assessment and inspection techniques for higher grade/strength steels; fracture considerations for higher grade/strength steels; and strength, ductility and toughness characteristics of higher grade/strength steels.

?	Higher pipe design pressure - Pipe designed to allow higher pressure would allow greater volumes of gas or liquid to be moved through a given diameter of pipe without adversely affecting safety or integrity.  Examples of projects of interest include guidelines for the use of higher design factors, the technical basis for the use of higher pressure designs, and design approaches to allow design pressures of 2800 psig and above. 

?	Welding and joining - Welds and joints, particularly in replacement or repair situation, have different performance characteristics and failure factors than the pipe itself.  Examples of projects of interest include improved weld defect detection and assessment methods, weldability and weld metal requirements of higher grade/strength steels, weldability and weld metal requirements for welding in-service pipes, welding techniques to avoid hydrogen cracking, alternative repair and remediation methods for in-service pipelines, and improved welding processes.

?	Composite pipe - Pipe made of, or layered with, materials other than steel may exceed current performance standards or allow greater flexibility or lower cost in challenging installation conditions.  Examples of projects of interest include flexible composite or non-metallic pipe for moderate or low pressure systems, composite reinforced line pipe and pipes making extensive structural use of thermoplastic resins.

?	Pipe coatings - Properly applied coatings, whether applied in the factory or in the field, can be one of the most significant factors in insuring pipeline integrity.  Examples of projects of interest include test methodologies to predict long-term performance, development of decision methodologies to improve coating choices, developing field-applied coatings with the cost and performance of factory-applied coatings, and intelligent coatings that monitor their conditions.

?	Mathematical pipeline modeling enhancements or computational pipeline modeling enhancements - Examples of projects of interest include better modeling of growth defects, mathematical algorithms that will improve pipeline modeling and improved pipeline operating data to better detect small leaks.

?	Improved directional drilling - Directional drilling can safely and effectively place an underground utility beneath roads, rivers, and other difficult areas but recent accidents have shown problems may occur during the process.  Examples of projects of interest include new drilling techniques that can prevent accidental damage to existing underground utilities or the utility being installed, and technologies that will detect underground utilities in the path of the directional drill.

?	Airborne chemical mapping and encroachment monitoring - Approaches using aerial surveillance with technologies for right-of way and leak detection monitoring.  Examples of projects of interest include the use of unmanned or other aerial vehicles to monitor pipeline conditions, encroachment, and small leaks, and innovative approaches to preempt third party damage to pipelines by detecting encroachment of pipelines and their rights-of-ways.

?	Small leak detection - Ecological and drinking water resources can be severally impacted by small pipeline leaks that are not quickly detected.   Examples of projects of interest include monitoring technologies that can quickly detect the release of a small portion of the total product being transported, leak detection equipment for very small leaks, and research that will reduce the cost of current leak detection equipment.

?	Human factors - Rotating pipeline controller shifts, human fatigue, and the interaction between operator personnel and pipeline machinery can contribute to pipeline accidents.  Topics of interest include technologies and procedures designed or modified to minimize operator error, research on the effects of rotating pipeline controller shifts and potential solutions for minimizing those effects, human interface in database management and other portions of the pipeline operating system.  


WHITE PAPERS: RSPA is soliciting white papers on proposed research activities dealing with improved material performance and other pipeline safety improvements.  Proposals must include a cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost in order to be considered.  Each white paper, not to exceed five pages including appendices and backup materials, must include sufficient information to evaluate the following areas:

1.	Offeror's understanding, and description, of the "state of the art" in the research area the offeror is proposing to address;
2.	The scientific and technical merit of the proposal to advance pipeline safety;
3.	The adequacy and feasibility of the technical approach and realism of cost estimate;
4.	Technical experience and capabilities of the offeror in federal research programs, and
5.	Time line to implement the proposed technologies and concepts into practice in the pipeline industry (one to three years preferable)
All evaluation factors are of equal importance.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Gamma camera imaging systems are essential tools in nuclear medicine clinics.  These systems are routinely checked for quality performance using sealed ?flood? sources that present a uniform gamma field as a uniform gray-scale image in the camera field-of-view.  Using a flood source, potential imaging system defects appear as lighter or darker regions to indicate locations of camera detectors that are not properly tuned.  The absolute uniformity of the flood source is highly important.  The flood source technology developed at the DOE?s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory involves a flood source device and method for making the device that provides a uniform radionuclide source distribution with highly uniform gamma levels across the surface of the flood source.  This technology involves an improved design for flood shells featuring a strong ABS plastic outer shell and a durable and uniform epoxy resin filler of uniform thickness that contains a uniform distribution of cobalt-57.

The upgrade of the scan head requires knowledge of the original design, which is proprietary.  The current amplifier must physically integrate with the geometry of the scan head.  The current amplifier, additional box of controller electronics, and control software must be compatible with the current AFM controller electronics, which designs are proprietary.  Compatibility of the new and existing components is also necessary to ensure the safety of the instrument during the exchange of high voltage signals.   No competitive solicitation is planned.  Any information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest.  This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  FAR provisions are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The anticipated award date is January 15, 2003.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Below are additional questions submitted and the answers on RFQ N00600-03-Q-0618

Q1: What specific deliverables are expected at the end of the 30 day performance period? 

A1: A list of candidates that meet or exceed the technical and executive qualifications of the position.  The deliverable should include each candidate's resume and a summary of their executive core qualifications.

Q2: The solicitation speaks of a list of all candidates along with the contractor's comments and recommendations, but this deliverable does not seem consistent with other executive search contracts.  

A2: All candidates (those identified by the firm and those that choose to apply directly to the DON) will be certified by an executive resources board (government personnel).  The final selection certificate could have candidate(s) from the firm and candidates that applied directly to the DON.  We expect a campaign to include direct telephone contact with high potential candidates (a result of targeted advertising).  Your search process should include a screening process based on the qualifications articulated in the statement of work.  Your list of candidates could potentially include government and non-government candidates. We hope to reach a wide and diverse
candidate pool to include senior HR executives within and outside federal government.

Q3: In the first phase, the contractor normally provides a highly screened list of the best qualified candidates at approximately 30 days as an interim step, not a final step.  In a normal executive search the contractor would meet with the client to discuss this "30-day list" of the best qualified candidates, approximately 6-8 individuals, at 30 days.  Together the client
and the contractor would narrow the list down to a "long list" of 3-6 potential candidates for personal interviews by the contractor. 

A3: The Vacancy Announcement for this position will close in early February (which may be extended) We'd like to have the firm's list of best qualified candidates 2-3 weeks after the closing date of the announcement.  The selecting official (ASN(M&RA)) will appoint an executive evaluation panel to narrow the list.  This panel will review the "non-firm" candidates as well as those presented by the firm.

Q4: In the second phase of the contract,the client and contractor would collectively narrow the list down to a "short list" of final candidates, normally 3 individuals.  The client would then normally only conduct personal interviews with the final candidates. The performance time to complete this type of activity with two phases is approximately 60 days.
A4: See required timeline stated in RFQ and answer to question 3 above. 
Q5:  Does the DON expect the contractor to have conducted personal interviews with candidates at the 30 day performance period?
A5: Yes
Q6: Does the DON anticipate a meeting between the contractor and the client prior to initiating the executive search? 
A6:  Yes

<DESC>The United States Postal Service will pre-qualify suppliers capable of repairing damaged A, A2, AMJ, LD-7, and Lexan air cargo containers described in the Statement of Work. Pre-qualification is a process where a supplier's ability to meet specific Postal Service requirements is evaluated. After a review of the Supplier Requirements for Pre-qualification statements have been completed, those deemed most qualified (pre-qualified) to perform the work will be awarded ordering agreements. Not all qualified suppliers may be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others thereby precluding contract opportunities for the less qualified. The USPS decision to pre-qualify suppliers is a business decision of the Contracting Officer. Pre-qualification does not constitute an award of the work or a promise of any work in the future. No solicitation exists.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate with McKesson BioServices, for a modification to its Contract N01-AI-05413.  The contract currently provides regulatory support services for the operations of the Office of Regulatory Affairs, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.  The Contractor is responsible for data and document collection and compilation for regulatory filing for Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) with the US Food and Drug Administration; technical review and report preparation; clinical site monitoring activities; final container packaging; labels, storage, distribution and tracking of investigational products; implementing and maintaining computer information systems; providing administrative coordination and general logistical support for regulatory activities and other services as required.  The planned negotiated modification will provide for a level of increased effort over a period of five (5) years (within the contract's current period) to expand the DMID's capability to conduct Phase I, II and III evaluations of candidate vaccines and treatments for the Congressionally mandated development of medical counter measures against biological agents and toxins that may be involved in bio-defense emergencies.  This will require expansion of all aspects of the infrastructure that McKesson and their subcontractors already have in place to meet this requirement for rapid response in the development and testing of these products.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by the closing date noted above.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>99--PARTNERING FOR VISITOR CENTER
<DESC>REQUEST FOR OFFERS for Space Act Agreement For Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Visitor Center BACKGROUND: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to collaborate with prospective partners specifically to seek creative and innovative approaches aimed at satisfying the Agency's objectives related to its Visitor Center functions, to be described in a Space Act Agreement.  Your attention is directed to Sections 203(c) (5) and (11) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, which may serve as authority for a resulting agreement.  This effort is aimed at more adequately serving as a vehicle for inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.  The costs of maintaining the Visitor Center, as well as those of operating a quality program have escalated to the level that it is no longer feasible for the Center to operate in the traditional manner.  Therefore, we are seeking to establish a public/private venture that is inclusive of GSFC, namely, to incorporate the GSFC Visitor Center functions within an aerospace context larger than NASA alone.  The location of GSFC in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area makes this an attractive solution since the area is replete with attractions, many of which have aerospace ties. As the operator of the GSFC official Visitor Center, the successful vendor will provide intensive and extensive outreach and education programs to both formal and informal education communities, space related business endeavors, as well as to a tourist audience, with special attention focused on stimulating interest in science, mathematics and technology/engineering related to NASA enterprises.  GSFC will play an active part in this effort.  Visitor Center functions may or may not be located solely within the immediate GSFC campus.  Therefore, the focus of the resulting agreement should be to provide visitor functions. ANNOUNCEMENT OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the Visitor Center effort are: 1) to develop a creative approach to implementing Visitor Center functions independent of, or in combination with operations at the current building; 2) to provide a venue for development and validation of exciting NASA enterprise-related education products and programs for students and adults;  3) to provide a venue for improving local economic potential by stimulating new collaborations with formal and informal education organizations; and 4) to promote high visibility and understanding of NASA's role. COMPONENTS NASA sees the creative effort as having the following components: a. A partnership with a consortium of aerospace education interests that creates a magnet causing other organizations to come together to provide an integrated approach to aerospace, Earth and space science education and visitor services.
