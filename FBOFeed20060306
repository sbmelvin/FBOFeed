<DESC>CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES Title:	Develop Ground Observer Requirements that Provide Acceptable Collision Avoidance Service to the Unmanned Aerial Pilot while Operating in the National Airspace System Procurement Method: Market Survey The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a contract to a very small business with a NAISC code of 541330 (Very small business is a business whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the North American Industry System Classification Codes assigned to a contracting opportunity.) for research and development of products that will be used to determine whether the recommended ground observer standard of one mile horizontal and 3000 vertical feet is adequate to detect and recognize non-cooperative (no transponder) and cooperative aircraft in the national airspace system.  The FAA needs support to determine whether the ground observer distance standards are acceptable in providing collision avoidance service to the unmanned aerial pilot.  Specific support will include suggested ground observer vision requirements, medical and physiological requirements, maximum distance that a ground observer can detect and recognize airborne objects, and ground observer performance measurements estimating whether two distant airborne targets are on a collision or non-collision path. The contract performance period of three years, including options, is planned.  The estimated contract value will be $500,000 over the life of the contract. The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market for available sources with the capabilities, resources and qualifications to provide the research and development services required.  Vendors interested in this requirement are requested to address the following qualification of resources that would be made available: 1.	At a minimum, technical expertise will include a Ph.D. in Psychology with a special emphasis in visual perception. 2.	Demonstrated experience as a vision science aviation expert who has participated in or served as an expert witness in aircraft midair accident investigations. 3.	Demonstrated publication record that demonstrates a consistent record of scholarly activity. A minimum of 1.5 peer-reviewed scientific journal articles for every year since their Ph.D. was awarded.  4.	Demonstrated aviation flight experience.  Minimum qualifications should be a rated Certified Instrument Flight Instructor. 5.	Demonstrated experience in scientific program management (preferably within the Federal system). 6.	Demonstrate knowledge of the FAA flight standards and certification research process. 7.	Demonstrate previous research experience related to See and avoid topics (PART 91).   8.	Demonstrated experience in writing flight test plans and evaluating pilot performance. 9.	Demonstrated experience in conducting flight tests to evaluate pilots' ability to avoid an airborne collision. 10.	Demonstrated ability to conduct experimental tests.  Ability to write an introduction, methods, results and conclusion for evaluating pilot behavior. 11.	Demonstrate ability to conduct experimental tests to evaluate ground observers' ability to detect, recognize, and identify airborne targets. 12.	Demonstrated knowledge of FAA national airspace air traffic control requirements. Interested entities should provide a written qualification statement (not to exceed 10 pages) documenting each of the requirements listed above including references.  The qualification statements will be evaluated to determine if the vendors are able to provide the level of expertise needed to fulfill this requirement.   All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. Parties that can meet this requirement should send a reply to Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C.20591.

<DESC>Contractor to conduct an evaluation of the current version of the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) program release, determine the required changes to meet the stated objectives, and implement those changes.  This action includes completing interfaces, revising the data model, confirming capability to meet the system requirements and documenting all actions.  The effort will include completing the requisite reports for basic financial analysis for all three Transportation Component Commands (TCCs), as well as, USTRANSCOM and the Defense Courier Service (DCS). The completion of this effort will result in a Financial Data Warehouse and reporting capability that meets all stated objectives for the system.  The overall development objective is to build on the successes accomplished during the previous periods with the implementation of USTRANSCOM financial interfaces and related financial applications. The financial application provides both financial and operational data in a format that enables USTRANSCOM managers to make more informed financial decisions.  The application solution leverages existing systems, interfaces and infrastructure including the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  This allows operational users a better understanding of transportation financial impacts relative to operations.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for developing and testing technologies that will enable comprehensive measurements of the long wavelength emission spectrum of the Earth and the Planets. NASA is particularly interested in measurements of the "far-infrared" emission spectrum, defined as wavelengths between 10 and 100 micrometers.  NASA requires detectors that offer  background- limited-performance when operated at temperatures at 10 kelvin or above.  The Government's budget for this procurement is $200,000 and it is anticipated that DRS will provide matching funds. DRS was the only respondent to a Sources Sought Synopsis posted on January 20, 2006.  NASA/LaRC intends to negotiate with DRS on a sole source basis.  Based on the market research conducted, DRS is the only known source that can meet our requirements for detector technology development within the available funding as augmented by matching funds. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 30 March 2006; FY 07 by 31 January 2007; FY 08 by 31 October 2007; FY 09 by 31 October 2008 and, FY 10 by 31 October 2009.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 March 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:
It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity.  Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers' ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non–military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.

Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.

Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised.  Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve.  A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.

Objective:

This program will be acquired in two Phases.  Phase I will be the definition phase and will consist of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and Defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.  Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures will be presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia and therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with this requirement.  Phase I is the area that we are soliciting white papers for now.  

Phase II will be the environmental development and operations phase.  Additional information will be issued around the January 2007 timeframe concerning Phase II and white papers for Phase II will be solicited at that time.

The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative.  The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.

The environment should be open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators.  This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools.  Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available.  Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested in the loop allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment.  This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.

The Systems and Software Test Track should also provide a place (possibly virtual and not a single physical location) for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories.  The experimental platforms should incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms should be made accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research should include subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications.  This environment should provide a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations.  A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment.  The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.

Research Concentration Areas:
The goal of the Phase 1 research is to A) Define, develop, and document the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and B) Define, develop and document the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.

The CONOPS document should be written to communicate overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to the user, buyer, developer, and other organizational elements.  It should describe the system, operational policies, classes of users, interactions among users, and organizational objectives from an integrated systems point of view.

Areas to consider when developing the CONOPS include, but are not limited to:

Intellectual property issues;

International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export control issues; 

Tool Evaluation; 

Features and methods to promote and monitor practitioner and researcher interaction as well as providing academic researchers access to large complex software systems; 

Technology Transition/Transfer of improved embedded software component integration tools and techniques into military system development programs; 

Supporting facilities and staffing, location(s), networking, firewall and policy related issues.

The Architecture definition should provide the ability to understand and control those elements of system design that capture the system's utility, cost, and risk.  These elements could be the physical components of the system and their relationships, the logical components or enduring principles or patterns that create enduring structures.  The definition shall provide a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions and interfaces.

Areas to consider when developing the Architecture include, but are not limited to:

The environment, virtual or not, to host, execute and test technology, both hardware environment (run time platform) and software environment (run time platform); 

Interfaces and collaborations; 

Mechanisms to support research and analysis of DoD problems including, but not limited to: software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools; 

Data repositories for results, success stories, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results, software disaster studies defining problems and basic research areas, ability to upload/download artifacts; 

Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics; 

Metrics including reduced development time; ease in which domain experts and software engineers can interact; ease in which different domain experts can specify and design code independently of one another; usability, i.e., the 'naturalness' of the modeling language from which code is generated; ability of test engineers to modify and tune code in the field; accurate automated documentation in design
Mechanism for studying innovative systems and dynamic processes, not static snapshots

Anticipated Schedule:  Phase 1 – The Definition Phase will begin with a kickoff workshop and proceed with a several month CONOPS and Architecture development for the Systems and Software Test Track.  A review workshop will be held mid-way through the phase I effort where the initial concepts can be briefed to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.  The final months should be devoted to completing the initial concepts and incorporating comments from the review workshop.  A final review workshop should be held in the final month where the final CONOPS and Architectures can be presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia invited to review the ideas and provide feedback.  Phase 1 awardees will have to present the full extent of their work at a mid-term and final workshop, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.  Also, the Phase 1 work will provide the basis for the phase 2 solicitation, and be used both by the Government for definition of the Phase 2 addendum, and as a repository available for phase 2 offerors use.  Therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with these requirements.

Phase 2 –Additional information will be provided as a modification to this BAA to initiate the phase 2 which will consist of the Development and Operations phase.  This modification is anticipated to be issued in January 2007.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development of the CONOPS and architecture, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

A phase 1 awardee will have to present the full extent of their work at a mid-term and final workshop, attendance at which will not be limited to only the Government and awardees.  Also, the Phase 1 work will provide the basis for the phase 2 solicitation, and be used both by the Government for definition of the Phase 2 addendum, and as a repository available for phase 2 offerors use.  Therefore, the technical data rights proposed need to be consistent with these requirements.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>Law School Administrative Expert to Provide Technical Assistance to Law Faculties in the Arabian Gulf Region.

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region’s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  

As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have an ever-greater familiarity with commercial law.  The objective of this particular technical assistance activity is to increase the capacity of law faculties in the region to cultivate future lawyers, judges, policy makers and business people who have an adept understanding of international commercial law practices and standards. As part of an ongoing program to this end, CLDP anticipates awarding a contract to two qualified experts to provide advice regarding the administration of commercial law curricula in law schools in the Middle East.  The experts will advise on the human resource and organizational requirements for the best administration of a commercial law curriculum.

General Description of Work 

Based on in-country consultations with the deans and administrators of the participating institutions, the Contractor will provide specifically tailored advice on all issues of commercial law curriculum administration.  Specifically, but not exclusively, the experts will provide information on appropriate faculty qualifications for the relevant courses, faculty sourcing, capacity building procedures for such faculty, as well as input on crafting course descriptions and syllabus formation.  The Contractor will provide the following services to accomplish this transfer of expertise:

a.	Achieve, in cooperation with CLDP and the appropriate law faculties in the Middle East, an awareness of the latest state of development of the commercial law curricula in the institutions designated by CLDP.

b.	Based on this understanding, and prior to initial consultations in country, draft a preliminary memo on projected areas of need for designated law faculties, challenges to achieving more successful administration, and other points of interest. 

c.	Conduct meetings, in country, with appropriate law school deans and law professors of designated institutions in the Middle East in order to consult on areas of needed input and identify areas of future consultative support.

d.	Submit progress reports for each trip to the region.

e.	Participate in US based consultative visits for law school deans and professors from the designated institutions as they may arise in continuation of the technical assistance program.

The duration of the contract is from date of award through September 30, 2006, with one one-year option period.  The government reserves the right to exercise the option. The contract is expected to commence on or about January 23, 2006.  Award will be a Fixed Price contract and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Quote (RFQ).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 1. This is a special notice requesting information to help the U.S. Air  Force examine potential capabilities and military uses of an emerging  aircraft class called Very Light Jet (VLJ). This class is generally  defined  by a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) no greater than 10,000 lb,  powered by one or two gas turbine engines (turbofan or turbojet), and a  commercial list price of much less than $5M per aircraft. 2. The Air Force is requesting information from appropriate companies or  parties currently developing VLJ aircraft on a) the capabilities of their  VLJ aircraft and b) the companies’ interest in supporting limited  qualitative evaluations of their VLJ aircraft by fully qualified Air Force  test pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) to be conducted  preferably by the end of CY2006. These qualitative flight evaluations or  ‘qual evals’ will assist the Air Force in examining military missions this  class of aircraft may be suited to perform. The Air Force desires to  perform these qual evals at either Edwards AFB, CA or at a location of the  interested party’s selection. The intent of the qual evals is to  investigate VLJ aircraft characteristics for potential AF missions and  will not require any permanent modification or change to the aircraft.  Broad industry participation in the VLJ RFI is encouraged, and VLJ designs  that are not mature enough for qual evals in 2006 are still acceptable.  During the initial information gathering of this VLJ RFI, request  companies planning to provide a capability response identify, to the Air  Force point of contact (POC) named below, the name of your company,  address, telephone number, and name and position in the company of the  individual to contact for future dialog. 3.  The Air Force is interested in assessing military utility for specific  missions that the VLJ class may be suited to perform including  passenger/cargo transport, navigation training, transition training,  Homeland Defense, surveillance, and target tow. Industry responses should  rank order the missions their VLJ may be best suited to perform, with  strengths and weaknesses of each mission discussed in two pages or less  per mission. However, as this is probably not an exhaustive list, the Air  Force requests identification of any additional missions that industry  believes this class of aircraft could perform. 4.  Finally, the Air Force is interested in obtaining current and accurate  information for each VLJ vehicle to include the characteristic data noted  in the Table below (this table is also posted to the PIXS library located  at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/default.asp).  Technical parameters,  likely concepts-of-operation, mission performance assessment results, and  price will all be considered during this AF VLJ capability assessment.  Responses are limited to:  a) a cover page, (including a name and telephone number of a technical  point of contact (if different from the contact information identified  above) having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses to  government representatives, a statement indicating if the company would  support a qualitative flight evaluation (either at Edwards AFB, CA or at  the location of the company’s choice), and a brief discussion of any costs  and/or liabilities that need addressed by the parties; b) up to ten pages for aircraft description, including technical and  general data summarized in the table below and descriptive text to provide  additional detail; and c) up to two pages for each viable mission. Participants will be provided the Air Force assessment of the capability  of their respective aircraft. 5.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For  Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to  award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any  information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does  not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to  otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost  under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent  Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation.  No responses received will be used as a proposal. 6. Further AF interest in VLJ will be dependent on the results of the RFI  capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and Air  Force operational requirements analyses and determinations. Potentially,  future leasing or purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain aircraft  in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or  instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation. These more  comprehensive flight evaluations would most likely be conducted following  FAA type certification of the specific aircraft under evaluation;  consequently, timing will also be dependent on certification status. 7. Companies are not limited to a single aircraft configuration for this  RFI; however, each VLJ aircraft configuration must be clearly identified  in a separate narrative summary.  Request that the narrative summaries  discuss specific aircraft information delineated above in paragraph 2.  Submissions are requested within 30 days of this announcement and may be  made by e-mail or mailing your response on a floppy disk (or compact disk)  to:             Ms. Noelle Spalding, (937) 255-7210 ext 3108             Contract Negotiator             Noelle.spalding@wpafb.af.mil             ASC/AASS/PK (Bldg 28, Rm 219, 2145 Monahan Way)             Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7017 With a notice of delivery to:   Mrs. Pat Krabacher, (937) 904-4501                                                 Contracting Officer                                                 patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil                                                 ASC/XRS (Capability  Planning Div, 2275 D St., Bldg 16, RM 053)                                                 Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7217 Personnel hand-carrying responses should contact the Contract Negotiator  to arrange a likely arrival time. 8.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   This is an Updated Notice for EPA'S RFQ for Quality Management System Enterprise Software that corrects the website link found at the bottom of the RFQ: The Environmental Protection Agency National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor Michigan is  the operating standard in the United States for measuring the gaseous emission generated by both gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles and engines.  The Laboratory Operations Division (LOD) is currently implementing a quality management system (QMS) based on the principles and requirements contained  in ISO 17025.  ISO 17025 is a quality management standard equivalent to ISO 9000:2000, but with specific laboratory focus. Because a QMS shoud be an integral part of the daily business processes, NVFEL is seeking a software tool that shall allow for increased efficiency and improved communication  channels.  The software tool shall contain modules (or databases) based on an ISO quality system, have email capability, and be utilized to assist workflow and follow-up.  Workflow is defined both within and between modules.  The software package shall contain (at a minimum) the following key  modules: document control, change control/notification, training, and corrective/preventive action. Software packages shall be commerical off-the-shelf (COTS) with the ability to modify the software with the addition/deletion of modules.  Software packages which also contain modules that allows for  audits, planning, risk assessment, deviations/non-conformances, customer concerns(complaints) and calibration tracking will receive preference by the EPA.  The option to incorporate modules based on ISO 14000 Environmental System requirements and or OHSAS-1800 Safety and Health Management  requirements is desirable.   The modules contained within the package shall be easily configurable by non-Information Technology personnel and should be supplied with existing industry (or ISO accepted) forms and templates.  Delivery of this software package and selected option to NVFEL is expected  within approximately 6 months or less.  Contractor may be requested to demostrate the functionality of software package.  Contractor must have all approved licenses and agreements to modify the software if not owned by contractor.  Government will expected "unrestricted data rights " to the  software purchased. This text is the pre-solicitation notice for this requirement.  The Request for Quote will be made available on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's website on/or about March 6, 2006.  The EPA web site is <http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adp_placement/qmssoftware/index.htm>.   Contractor's interested in this requirement should monitor this website for posting of information.

<DESC>This is a request for information purposes only.  AT THIS TIME, NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, and as such any request for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is seeking sources capable of providing services to implement a centralized, online system for the management of Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) pledges and their distribution and to provide customer support to Federal employee donors. Due to delays associated with irradiating mail at Government facilities, it is suggested that your package be sent by commercial delivery service.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to ask interested business and non-profit concerns to submit capability statements to evaluate the feasibility of maintaining an online workplace donation system designed to promote electronic CFC donations from Federal donors, provide those donors with central access to all CFC participating charities, and eliminate current CFC geographic restrictions to donating only to national and local charities eligible in the donor’s local campaign.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this notice, however, a separate synopsis will be released prior to any such solicitation.  

Potential contractors should provide information concerning: (1)  software applications and support services for assigning unique identification codes for the estimated 15,000+  participating CFC charities; (2) software applications and support services to maintain a National CFC Charity Registry/Database and profile of all CFC charities; (3) software applications and support services that will allow over 1 million potential users to access the system during peak hours and to pledge electronically to charities located outside of the campaign corresponding to their official duty station; (4) software applications and support services that allow interface with local campaign fiscal agents (Principal Combined Federal Organizations (PCFOs)), Federal payroll offices and CFC charities; (5)  telephone-based voice recognition system for employees without internet access; (6) software applications and fiscal management services to support accountability on multiple levels (i.e. between contractor and donors, contractor and charities and contractor and PCFOs, and contractor and OPM); and, (7) information as to how a proposed contractor would respond to CFC regulatory and reporting compliance issues. 
Potential contractors would not be required to provide both the software and operations support, but must have the infrastructure and capacity to manage the entire system.   

The CFC program allows contributions from September 1 to December 15 of each year, therefore the software requirements for receiving on-line pledges is cyclical.  It is anticipated that information about the participating charities could be accessed year-round.  The overall system must comply with the regulatory requirements of the CFC found at www.opm.gov/cfc.  
 
OPM requests business and non-profit concerns to submit capability statements that include a description of the organization’s ability to meet the above requirements.  It is important that submitted capability statements include complete information addressing each of the above information requirements and should include:  estimated price for development and implementation (including pricing per transaction), and estimated product development cycle for implementation.  Interested businesses should also submit information concerning the size, type, structure, and governance of the organization, and information and regarding experience with similar programs.  Capability statements will be reviewed to determine capacity to handle the scope of services required and pricing alternatives.  Responses to this synopsis must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. on April 3, 2006.  Please submit two copies of your response to: Sharon Phillips, Contracting Officer, Contracting Group, MS-CCFAS, U.S Office of Personnel Management, Room 1342, 1900 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20415. Due to delays associated with irradiating mail at Government facilities, it is suggested that your package be sent by a commercial delivery service.

All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to this solicitation incorporates the Questions and Answers.  The closing date for quotes remains unchanged.  End Amendment 1.

Law School Administrative Expert to Provide Technical Assistance to Law Faculties in the Arabian Gulf Region.

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region’s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  

As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have an ever-greater familiarity with commercial law.  The objective of this particular technical assistance activity is to increase the capacity of law faculties in the region to cultivate future lawyers, judges, policy makers and business people who have an adept understanding of international commercial law practices and standards. As part of an ongoing program to this end, CLDP anticipates awarding a contract to two qualified experts to provide advice regarding the administration of commercial law curricula in law schools in the Middle East.  The experts will advise on the human resource and organizational requirements for the best administration of a commercial law curriculum.

General Description of Work 

Based on in-country consultations with the deans and administrators of the participating institutions, the Contractor will provide specifically tailored advice on all issues of commercial law curriculum administration.  Specifically, but not exclusively, the experts will provide information on appropriate faculty qualifications for the relevant courses, faculty sourcing, capacity building procedures for such faculty, as well as input on crafting course descriptions and syllabus formation.  The Contractor will provide the following services to accomplish this transfer of expertise:

a.	Achieve, in cooperation with CLDP and the appropriate law faculties in the Middle East, an awareness of the latest state of development of the commercial law curricula in the institutions designated by CLDP.

b.	Based on this understanding, and prior to initial consultations in country, draft a preliminary memo on projected areas of need for designated law faculties, challenges to achieving more successful administration, and other points of interest. 

c.	Conduct meetings, in country, with appropriate law school deans and law professors of designated institutions in the Middle East in order to consult on areas of needed input and identify areas of future consultative support.

d.	Submit progress reports for each trip to the region.

e.	Participate in US based consultative visits for law school deans and professors from the designated institutions as they may arise in continuation of the technical assistance program.

The duration of the contract is from date of award through September 30, 2006, with one one-year option period.  The government reserves the right to exercise the option. The contract is expected to commence on or about January 23, 2006.  Award will be a Fixed Price contract and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Quote (RFQ).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, shall be utilized in the selection of the offer that is most advantageous to the to the Government based on the factors contained in the solicitation. The solicitation notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (FedBizOpps) site www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a response which if timely received, must be considered by the Agency. No paper copies of solicitations or amendments will be issued.

<SUBJECT>R--Criteria and Procedures for Indian Water Right Settlements
<SOLNBR>06SQ1U0550
<RESPDATE>031606
<ARCHDATE>03062007
<CONTACT>Connie Morgan Purchasing Agent 5095755848241  ;
<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Upper Columbia Area  Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory and assistance services with  formulating a settlement position and determining the value of a settlement, as required by the DOI "Criteria and Procedures for Indian Water Right Settlements." The tasks identified below are designed to address specific information needs for the DOI assessment report and the Federal Negotiating Team in addressing settlement options.  A primary requirement of the economist for this team is to analyze the existing information developed by the Tribe for credibility, and to assist in determining the value of settlement.  To that end, a certain degree of latitude in tasks and data needs is appropriate, and will be provided by the Cascade Economics team, given the nature of settlement discussions. Statement of Work:   1. Analysis of Economic Data Developed by the Tribal Consultant The data to be provided in this task relates to the economic components and feasibility of a future irrigation plan in support of Practicably Irrigable Acreage (PIA).  Cascade Economics will analyze the plan and its elements for realism and correctness by considering the data used, modeling approach, reasoning, and results as presented by Tribe's consultant. 2.  Conduct Analysis of Future Water Plans In the course of preparing information in support of the settlement, the Tribe has identified a number of water related projects that it may be contemplating.  These projects are intended to be future options that could be put into practice at some point in the future should the associated quantity of water required ultimately be decreed.  The task will be accomplished by conducting a reconnaissance level market analysis of the various projects identified in order to determine their degree of reasonableness.  3. Value of Settlement Analysis The "Criteria and Procedures" were designed to provide guidance to the Federal Negotiating Team in negotiating settlements.  A primary component of the "Assessment and Recommendations" phase is to (1) measure all costs presuming no settlement, and (2) measure complete settlement costs to all the parties.   An important requirement within the "Criteria and Procedures" is the determination of the value associated with the benefits of settlement.  The value of settlement must be measured in various ways, and measured in terms of benefits to the United States and each of the parties involved.  4. A final component that may be necessary is the value of settlement to other parties, including the State of California and other non-Indian entities.  This is often accomplished by considering the value of water in its forecasted use and the so-called multiplier effect in terms of economic commerce and secondary impacts for the regional or state economy.  5. Interaction with the Federal Negotiating Team and Participation in Negotiation Meetings: As noted above in Tasks 1 through 3, interaction with members of the Federal Negotiating Team will be necessary to ensure consistency with the vision of the team, and in response to settlement discussions.   Reclamation has determined that Cascade Economics LLC is the only reasonable source based upon the following criteria:  The specialized nature of the field has a limited number of individuals qualified.  Cascade Economics LLC is a research and consulting firm specializing in natural resource economics.  Cascade Economics includes experienced professionals with specialties in economic analysis, water resources and water rights, litigation and negotiation support, agricultural production, regional economics, commercial fisheries, and environmental economics.  Additional expertise in socioeconomic analysis, EA/EIS preparation, and impacts analysis are represented at Cascade Economics, as well as research project management, technical writing, editing, and exhibit preparation.  Dr. Michael Taylor is the Managing Partner for Cascade Economics LLC, and will be the lead researcher for this project.  Dr. Taylor was the lead research economist for studies in support of federal reserved water rights on ten Indian reservations, and he has completed studies for nine others.  He serves or served as lead agricultural economist and designated expert witness for the United States for each of the following water rights cases:  Duck Valley Indian Reservation, Idaho and Nevada, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Northwest Region.  Lummi Indian Reservation, Washington, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Northwest Region. Hopi and Navajo Indian Reservations, Arizona, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Southwest Region. Nez Perce Indian Reservation, Idaho, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Northwest Region. Flathead Indian Reservation, Montana, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Northwest Region. Crow Indian Reservation, Montana, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Rocky Mountain Region. Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Montana, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Rocky Mountain Region. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.

Information Technology Services In 2005, the NBC was certified by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management as one of five Federal Shared Service Centers (SSC) for the Federal-wide Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB).  The vision of the HR LOB is to provide government-wide, modern, cost effective, standardized, and interoperable human resources solutions providing common core functionality to support the strategic management of Human Capital and addressing duplicative and redundant human resources systems and process across the Federal Government.   As a SSC, the NBC provides human resources operational support to a number of Federal agencies.  This support is provided across a broad spectrum of activities across the human resources life cycle phase.  The NBC currently provides support in most of the following sub-functions of the HR LOB Business Reference Model: 1.  Human Resources Strategy - Develop effective human capital management strategies to ensure Federal organizations are able to recruit, select, develop, train and manage a high quality, productive workforce in accordance with merit system principles. 2.  Organization and Position Management -Design, develop and implement organization and position structures that create a high-performance, competency-driven framework that both advances the agency mission and serves agency human capital needs. 3.  Staff Acquisition - Establish procedures for recruiting and selecting high quality, productive employees with the right skills and competencies, in accordance with merit system principles. 4.  Performance Management - Design, develop and implement a comprehensive employee performance management approach to ensure agency employees are demonstrating competencies required of their work assignments. 5.  Compensation Management - Design, develop and implement compensation programs that attract, retain and fairly compensate agency employees. 6.  Benefits Management - Design, develop and implement benefit programs that attract, retain and support current and former agency employees. 7.  Human Resources Development - Design, develop and implement a comprehensive employee development approach to ensure agency employees have the right competencies and skills for current and future work assignments. 8.  Employee Relations - Design, develop and implement programs that strive to maintain an effective employer-employee relationship that balances the agency's needs against its employees' rights. 9.  Labor Relations - Manage the relationship between the agency and its unions and bargaining units. 10.  Separations Management - Conduct efficient and effective employee separation programs that assist employees in transitioning to non-Federal employment, facilitate the removal of unproductive, non-performing employees; and assist employees in transitioning to retirement.

This Federal Business Opportunities, (FedBizOpps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed award of a follow-on task order through Government Services Administration (GSA) contract GS23F0246L to The Boeing Company.  ISRSG/PK intends to award a contract to provide for the Multimedia Message Manager (M3) software maintenance. <br> <br> The task order will have a period of performance of one year from date of award. <br> <br> The task order ceiling will be in the amount of $5,000,000. <br> <br> M3 software maintenance includes all labor, material, equipment and services to perform the following software engineering tasks: 1) Install M3 world wide (including hardware, software, network, CSP/AUTODIN connectivity, DA/CP-XP/DMS connectivity, etc.) at new and existing customer sites. 2) Provide M3 training for System Administrators (SA), Information System Security Managers (ISSM), Profile Administrators (PA), Operators and Users at new and existing customer sites. 3) Support M3 Security Accreditation Testing (SAT) at new customer sites. 4) Transition old message traffic to M3 at new customer sites. 5) Create initial M3 profile set and accounts at new customer sites. 6) Implement new functional enhancements and bug fixes in M3 for new version releases as required. 7) Update all M3 documentation for new version releases as required. 8) Upgrade existing customer sites to latest M3 version releases with little or no disruption of operational services. 9) Maintain and troubleshoot the current M3 software and documentation baseline as required. 10) Operate and manage the M3 8x5 Code 2 help desk. 11) Operate and manage the M3 24x7 Code 1 help desk.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6-302-1 entitled "Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:" Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-A9(1).  A Sources Sought was released to industry on 13 May 2005 with responses required to be submitted by 28 May 2005.  Based on the responses to this Sources Sought, the Government considers that an award to any source other than The Boeing Company would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in filling the Government's requirements.  Current M3 functionality must continue to maintain continuity of vital message handling services supporting national-level intelligence requirements. <br> The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation for the M3 would incur substantial duplication of costs in relation to technical and configuration knowledge of the M3, which would not be recovered through competition as well as the loss of critical uninterrupted software maintenance. <br> <br> Please direct any questions regarding this Notice to Patricia J. Forest, Contracting Officer, 781-266-1048.  The following Clause applies to this contract action. <br> <br> AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101  OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) <br> <br> (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br> <br> (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). <br> <br> (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [ESC Director, Commander' s Staff, Tel. (781) 377-5106, ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. <br> (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br> (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br> (End of clause) <br> See Note 26.

<DESC>Reference Sources Sought Synopsis for IT Application/Server Support, 19 Oct 2005.

We appreciate the interest expressed in the WR-ALC/IT effort to consolidate desktop support and application/server support contracts for WR-ALC.  Market research indicates a large number of capable companies, such that a great number of resources (both Government and Contractor) would be required to accomplish both competitive efforts in parallel.  Accordingly, the decision has been made to first focus on the desktop support effort.  We intend to pursue a partnership agreement with IT through an 8(a) set-aside competition.  Contractors meeting 8(a) criteria will be allowed to form teams including non-8(a) contractors.  An Industry Day is being planned for March 2006, with dates and details to be announced soon on the FedBizOpps website.  The Industry Day will provide an opportunity for clarification of the requirement, as well as industry input.  WR-ALC/IT plans to proceed with the application/server support effort following award of the desktop support effort.  We anticipate extending current software application/server support contracts by approximately 12 to 15 months to provide interim coverage.  For the application support consolidation effort, market research indicates a large number of capable companies.  Based on responses to the market research, we anticipate that this effort will also be conducted as an 8(a) set-aside competition.  Because of resource constraints, this effort will be delayed approximately 12 months.

SSA is planning to offer a new service to any interested parties.  As long as the party first obtains the required written consent of the number holder, we will, for a fee, verify a name and Social Security number combination as being correct (or incorrect) for any party registered to use the service.

Currently, we anticipate a May or June 2006 start date for the service.  There will be a limited time for parties to enroll in this service.  Once the enrollment period ends, there could be as much as a 3- year wait before additional companies will be permitted to enroll.

Please see Federal Register Notice Social Security Administration:  Agency Information Collection Activities:  Proposed Request, dated December 30, 2005, for more information about this service and to request documents such as the User Agreement that the party would sign with SSA and the consent form that must be completed by the Social Security number holder prior to you being permitted to send a request for Social Security number verification to SSA for processing.

Once the enrollment period ends, there could be as much as a 3- year wait before additional companies will be permitted to enroll.

Please see Federal Register Notice Social Security Administration:  Agency Information Collection Activities:  Proposed Request, dated December 30, 2005, for more information about this service and to request documents such as the User Agreement that the party would sign with SSA and the consent form that must be completed by the Social Security number holder prior to you being permitted to send a request for Social Security number verification to SSA for processing.  The direct link to the Federal Register Notice is: http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/E5-8095.pdf

<SUBJECT>25 -- Intent to Increase Maximum and Extend
<DESC>It is our intent to increase the maximum of contract SP0700-01-D-9704 by $3,000,000.00 based on the significant surge in demands and the urgent and compelling nature of the products included on this contract.  Increasing the contract maximum would allow the government to extend this contract to the end of 2006 until a successor contract is put in place.  Extension of this contract will prevent a lapse in coverage for subject NSNs and continue to fill the pipeline with supplies necessary to support combat operations for our military customer.  The NSN listing covered by SP0700-01-D-9704 are included below.  A new solicitation (SP0750-06-R-3984)is already available for a portion of the items on this contract and additional contracts, as of March 1, 2006.  If you should have any questions or concerns about the increase in the contract maximum or the new solicitation, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

HTTP://WWW.ARNET.GOV/FAR/FARQUERYFRAME.HTML. 52.204-7. Central Contractor Registration. (Oct 2003) Alternate I (Oct 2003). (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. Alternate I (Oct 2003).  As prescribed in 4.1104(a), substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause: (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR database by December 31, 2003.  The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of the SF 30, Amendment of solicitation/Modification of Contract, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in this contract. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Contractor is registered in the CCR database. Quotes shall include a total price for each of the two items.

This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the tasks required of the contractor to support 412 TW/ENR with the production of base plates and frames and the mounting and calibration of the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU’s) on said base plates.

	1.1  Background

The 412th Range Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB) is developing a Time Space Position Information (TSPI) sensor set for use in aircraft undergoing flight testing at EAFB and other Department of Defense test ranges.  As part of this, EAFB requires the integration and production of PC-104 base modules with a mounted Honeywell HG-1700 IMU’s and a custom digital interface.  This task request is for the required engineering effort to produce the necessary components of 7 combination base/frame units in the same manner of the three previous prototypes and 2 frames.

The Contractor shall produce 7 IMU fixtures that include a specific PC-104 base plate and stackable frame and a PC-104 compliant Interface Unit (IU) mounted in a separate stackable PC-104 frame, Microbee Part Number IMU-1700-104, and 2 empty frames, Microbee Part Number IMU-1700-BASE.  The Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) items are 7 Honeywell HG1700-AG58 Inertial Measurement Units (IMU).
 

2.2  Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Fixture Requirements

The Contractor shall mount an HG1700-AG58 unit on this base unit within a PC-104 frame of minimum height.  The Contractor shall mount the IMU to the base plate with the IMU axes aligned with the base plate axes.  If alignment cannot be performed to within 0.01 degrees, the alignment error must be measured and reported for each unit.

2.3  Interface Unit (IU) Requirements

The IU shall be designed to perform without failure under a normal industrial temperate range.  The IU shall include conformal coating, shall accept a TTL-level-1 Hz timing signal which it shall use for timing purposes and also feed to a selectable IRQ on the PC-104 bus.  The IU shall include an interface to the HG1700-AG58 IMU for the purposes of providing unit power and collecting measurements, shall include a general-use RS-422 asynchronous serial port that is accessible through the PC-104 bus and able to share an interrupt line with other ports, shall accept Type 1 and Type 2 messages from the IMU, shall time-tag the measurements with fractions of second to an accuracy of 1 microsecond and shall include a bus-level interface to provide measurement and timing information to a GFE computer in the PC-104 stack.  This can be either I/O mapped or memory mapped and shall be selectable.  The IU shall provide a bus interrupt when a complete IMU data message is available and  the interrupt shall be selectable by jumpers.  The Contractor shall provide the cable between the IU and the IMU.

2.4  Deliverables

The Contractor shall deliver 7 fully functional units, Microbee part number IMU-1700-104, including the base plate  with the IMU mounted, the IMU frame, the IU and frame, and IU-to-IMU cable.

No other communications equipment is compatible for use with NASA's systems and requirements.  This equipment being procured will be used for Launch Vehicle and Spacecraft Telemetry Data transport.  Launch Vehicle and Spacecraft Telemetry Data transport is a very specialized communications application.  This type of telemetry data does not conform to common telecommunications standards, and therefore, there are a very limited number of vendors who offer equipment for this application. The particular requirement, for which this equipment is being procured, is even more specialized.  It will be used to transport two types of telemetry: 1.	High speed variable rate synchronous telemetry without external clocking. 2.	High speed analog telemetry NASA KSC has performed extensive research into possible vendor sources for this application, and  has determined that Video Products Group Inc., Camarillo CA is the only vendor that offers equipment which meets these requirements.  Therefore this procurement must be sole-sourced to Video Products Group Inc.  The acquisition of any other communications equipment would entail unacceptable technical risk to KSC missions.    The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-07  This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334220, 750 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery to KSC, FL 32899  is required within 30 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.

SYSLOG (RFC 3153) alarm reporting
Description:   
Source telemetry signal, as clock & data, is input to the TSIM where it is converted to ATM cells using standard circuit emulation techniques. The TSIM has two modes of operation: standard & low delay.  In standard mode it generates AAL1 cells compliant with I363.1. In low delay mode, streams of less than 8 Kb/s are encoded as partially filled ATM cells to minimize delay.  TSIM supports synchronous clock mode on the input ports.  Upon receipt of the ATM cells, the telemetry source is reconstructed. The TSIM supports adaptive clock mode on the output ports.  In the adaptive clock mode, the TSIM uses adaptive clock techniques to regenerate the source clock.  An adaptive algorithm makes use of a deep jitter buffer to mediate the effects of CDV on data stability.  The depth of the jitter buffer is programmable to allow the user to optimize for CDV tolerance and delay.  The synchronous clock mode allows the transport of telemetry streams to be synchronized to the network.  All relevant alarms and statistics for proper operation and maintenance of the TTL TSIM are available remotely via a web-based browser interface.  The TMS provides remote management, complete service provisioning, fault & performance management and software administration capabilities for the TTL TSIM.

SYSLOG (RFC 3153) alarm reporting
Description:   
Source telemetry signal, as clock & data, is input to the TSIM where it is converted to ATM cells using standard circuit emulation techniques. The TSIM has two modes of operation: standard & low delay.  In standard mode it generates AAL1 cells compliant with I363.1. In low delay mode, streams of less than 8 Kb/s are encoded as partially filled ATM cells to minimize delay.  TSIM supports synchronous clock mode on the input ports.  Upon receipt of the ATM cells, the telemetry source is reconstructed. The TSIM supports adaptive clock mode on the output ports.  In the adaptive clock mode, the TSIM uses adaptive clock techniques to regenerate the source clock.  An adaptive algorithm makes use of a deep jitter buffer to mediate the effects of CDV on data stability.  The depth of the jitter buffer is programmable to allow the user to optimize for CDV tolerance and delay.  The synchronous clock mode allows the transport of telemetry streams to be synchronized to the network.  All relevant alarms and statistics for proper operation and maintenance of the TTL TSIM are available remotely via a web-based browser interface.  The TMS provides remote management, complete service provisioning, fault & performance management and software administration capabilities for the TTL TSIM.

SYSLOG (RFC 3153) alarm reporting
Description:   
Source telemetry signal, as clock & data, is input to the TSIM where it is converted to ATM cells using standard circuit emulation techniques. The TSIM has two modes of operation: standard & low delay.  In standard mode it generates AAL1 cells compliant with I363.1. In low delay mode, streams of less than 8 Kb/s are encoded as partially filled ATM cells to minimize delay.  TSIM supports synchronous clock mode on the input ports.  Upon receipt of the ATM cells, the telemetry source is reconstructed. The TSIM supports adaptive clock mode on the output ports.  In the adaptive clock mode, the TSIM uses adaptive clock techniques to regenerate the source clock.  An adaptive algorithm makes use of a deep jitter buffer to mediate the effects of CDV on data stability.  The depth of the jitter buffer is programmable to allow the user to optimize for CDV tolerance and delay.  The synchronous clock mode allows the transport of telemetry streams to be synchronized to the network.  All relevant alarms and statistics for proper operation and maintenance of the TTL TSIM are available remotely via a web-based browser interface.  The TMS provides remote management, complete service provisioning, fault & performance management and software administration capabilities for the TTL TSIM.
