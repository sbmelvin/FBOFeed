The minimum essential requirements can be found in the attached spreadsheet.
<p>Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. For reference, the NAICS code for this procurement is 334112 and the small business size standard is 1000 employees.<br /><br />Sole Source Justification (summary): The Air Force Disaster Recovery Program (AFDRP) has a requirement to provide Disaster Recovery protection and services for the underlying data storage/replication architecture at all six (6) Enterprise Service Centers (ESCs) in order to be fully consistent and interoperable with the existing data storage and replication architecture at the Department of the Defense Intelligence Information Systems (DoDIIS) Regional Service Centers (RSCs) and within the greater Intelligence Community (IC). Consistency and interoperability are required to ensure successful dissemination, storage, and replication of intelligence data. The procurement of the turn-key systems is a follow-on for continued production of highly specialized equipment and provision of highly specialized services available only from the original source, EMC Corporation.<br /><br />EMC Corporation is the only source that can fulfill the Government's requirement for the turn-key systems. Although EMC Corporation has multiple resellers, none of the resellers can fulfill the Government's materials and implementation requirements to perform a turn-key implementation.</p>
<p>Using similar technology from manufacturers other than EMC would not provide full interoperability with the existing DoDIIS environment. Mixed technology would not provide the Government the capability to dynamically and remotely manage switches for storage allocation on an application-need basis. Continuous data protection would not be possible since data saving and replication would not be completed simultaneously. Deviating from the current infrastructure would cause a significant duplication of costs, an unacceptable level of manpower utilization and workforce retraining, substantial expense to replace existing equipment, schedule disruption, and mission degradation.</p>

Continuous data protection would not be possible since data saving and replication would not be completed simultaneously. Deviating from the current infrastructure would cause a significant duplication of costs, an unacceptable level of manpower utilization and workforce retraining, substantial expense to replace existing equipment, schedule disruption, and mission degradation.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies (DRDS), Morgantown, WV, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to New York University School of Medicine, for research on "Validation of a Human HLA_DP Transgenic Mouse Model of chronic Beryllium Disease and Evaluation of the Relative Contributions of Dermal and Pulmonary Exposers in the Model". <br />The purpose is as follows: <br />This research seeks to provide data concerning the relative contribution of dermal versus the pulmonary routes of exposure to the development of chronic beryllium disease in the transgenic mouse "knock-in" model that expresses the human HLA-DPB1 gene family, namely: HLA-DPB1*0201, HLA-DPB1*0401 and HLA-DPB1*1701. In addition, this contract will implement the design for experiments to validate the HLA-DPB1 transgenic mouse model experimental design developed for the modified FY07 contract (212-2007-M-20091). <br />The project investigates the hypotheses that:<br />1. The human HLA-DPB1 gene family influences susceptibility to CBD with HLA-DPB1*1701 &gt; HLA-DPB1*0201 &gt; HLA-DPB1*0401.<br />2. Dermal exposure to beryllium may cause beryllium sensitization so that low doses of lung-deposited beryllium cause chronic beryllium disease (CBD).<br />Investigation of the first hypothesis is intended validate a transgenic mouse model for CBD and the experimental design for investigating the first hypothesis developed as the result of a previous award (212-2007-M-20091). Investigation of the second hypothesis is intended to determine the relative contributions of dermal versus pulmonary exposures in the human HLA-DP transgenic mouse model of CBD. The outcome of the experiments will be measured by histopathological examination of the lung for a granulomatous response similar to that seen in CBD in humans (Frieman and Hardy, Human Pathology 1:25-44, 1970). These outcomes will be determined by PPRB scientists in HELD/NIOSH.
<p>This purchase is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to New York University School of Medicine under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Kimberly P. Groves, 2009-Q-11384, CDC NIOSH 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with New York University School of Medicine as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to issue a sole source purchase order award to International Doors.  The Great Lakes Air and Marine location has an urgent requirement for hangar door repairs in its primary aircraft hangar.  The hangar doors do not operate properly and do not meet the safety standards set forth by OSHA.  The additional repairs are needed in order to completely repair the hangar doors to work properly.  International Doors is the intended vendor because they built and installed these doors approximately 30 years ago and is the only vendor familiar enough with the doors to repair them appropriately.  

Great Lakes Air and Marine is leasing their facility from the United States Air Force, and the Air Force has specific requirements as to hangar door operations and safety.  International Doors is the vendor used exclusively by the USAF at Selfridge ANGB, which is where Great Lakes Air and Marine is housed.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR FAA Crew Resource Management (CRM) Flight Evaluation Program
This is a market survey for the establishment of a Crew Resource Management (CRM) Flight Evaluation Program (Training) for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of developing and providing this training.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611512 - Flight Training with a standard of $25.5M.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business
2.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
A draft of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached.  Respondents are encouraged to review the PWS and provide comments.
All responses to this market survey must be received by 07/24/09, All submittals should be submitted to:

-Proposal receipt date (response date of 8/24/09) is approximate; the actual proposal due date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
- Title of Project:  Land Restoration and Vegetation Clearing
- Description:  The work of this contract will restore formerly developed areas of Everglades National Park. Over 7,000 acres of Everglades National Park consists of formerly developed land that was once farmed, graded and filled for roads or filled for some other purpose. Local agricultural practices included rock plowing, which breaks up underlying bedrock and dramatically alters soil structure. Agricultural fields were often heavily fertilized, resulting in nutrient rich soils, not at all typical of the very nutrient-poor Everglades. In south Florida, previously farmed or filled areas rapidly fill up with dense communities of exotic plants. The drained, artificially nutrient-enriched soils on these sites support such luxuriant plant growth that management of exotics in these areas is impractical. The park has developed techniques for restoring former agricultural or filled sites that restore natural conditions, promote native vegetation communities and minimize the need for ongoing exotic plant control. Over 3000 acres of previously farmed land in the Hole-in-the-Donut area of the park has already been successfully restored using these techniques. Many of the additional areas to be restored are in the East Everglades addition lands, though others are scattered throughout the park.
- Type of Procurement: One or more negotiated fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) service contract(s) with one base year and four option years will be considered for award requiring submission of both a technical proposal and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
- Estimated price range: $15 million (over 5 years)
- All responsible small business sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SETASIDE.
- It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source commercial items contract to Irvine Access Floors, Inc. located at 9425 Washington Blvd., Suite Y-WW, Laurel, Maryland, 20723 to provide open and closed whips, raised floor boxes and whip coupling modulars for use with the Communications Intergrators, Inc. (Cii) under floor power distribution system.    It is necessary to use genuine Cii parts because these are the only parts that will match the pin configuration.  The Pin Configuration of the Cii Wiring System is custom to SSA, and no other manufacturer’s materials will fit and operate in the system properly.  The use of this brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Government’s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Part 13 and FAR 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. It is SSA’s belief that Irvine Access Floors, Inc. is the only source qualified to meet our needs because of it is the only authorized distributor of Cii parts and materials for the Baltimore, MD region.   This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to Kimberly Huttenberger via email at Kimberly.Huttenberger@ssa.gov no later than 4:30pm, EST, July 13, 2009.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

participating in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Country
Methamphetamine Initiative in partnership with Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration.  

The proposed project will evaluate outcomes through a qualitative and quantitative
evaluation design. While traditional evaluation designs have almost exclusively
emphasized collection and analysis of quantitative data, a number of evaluation
researchers have elected to employ non-traditional mixed method designs based on their
ability to provide a richer, but complimentary characterization of the overall program
effect and impact.  The project Evaluation will:
Collect outcome data on American Indian/Alaska Natives tested for HIV/AIDS;
Collect outcome data on HIV/AIDS and substance abuse and mental health outreach, education, and prevention activities for American Indian/Alaska Natives; and

Collect public awareness information distributed to reduce the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS through culturally appropriate educational materials distributed and disseminated, outreach strategies implemented in traditional and non-traditional venues, and implementation of culturally appropriate media messaging.

As part of the project, Tribes will develop and foster a close working relationship with their local Indian Health Service provider so Tribes can refer and encourage HIV/AIDS testing of individuals.  The Tribes will evaluate the effectiveness of the following:

Strategies for encouraging HIV/AIDS testing; and
Increase or decrease of HIV/AIDS testing.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.

<CONTACT>Jennifer Sokolower, Contract Specialist, Phone 2024753777, Email jennifer.sokolower@uscg.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Kongsberg Maritime Simulation, Inc., West Mystic, CT, for a contract to obtain Contractor Project Coordination and Technical Support Services for U. S. Coast Guard Training Center (TRACEN) Petaluma.  This requirement is to modify and integrate multiple pieces of existing equipment and software packages into the proprietary primary simulation suite provided by Kongsberg Maritime Simulation Inc. to TRACEN Petaluma.  This integration is to ensure the visual bridge simulation is integrated with the combat information center (a.k.a. the operations center) simulator co-located at Training Center Petaluma’s C4ISR training building.  Kongsberg has completed previous contract efforts to develop the visual simulation for the bridge simulator as well as integrated some equipment and software that existed in 2006.  Since the award of the original contract in 2006, the Government has increased the demands and fidelity requirements to coordinate the existing simulation software in the combat training room with the visual simulator to provide an integrated and larger scale simulation system.  Initial bridge component integration was part of the previous contract effort; however, the scope and demand have exceeded those initial requirements, including the need to modify the existing bridge simulator software (POLARIS) to interface with the combat information center simulation suite. The current bridge and the operations center simulation suites independently mirror the National Security Cutter (NSC)/Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL) without the interfaces provided onboard the NSC/WMSL.  Therefore, simulations scenarios do not provide the robust and realistic environment necessary to prepare Government personnel adequately for shipboard situations that involve the bridge and combat.  

In order to provide adequate shipboard simulations and personnel training, Kongsberg shall integrate existing, disparate simulators, proprietary simulator programs and components into one overall simulation system that shall meet each of the following requirements:

1) The Contractor shall ensure that there is a seamless flow of data and information between the Kongsberg proprietary Maritime Bridge Simulation Maritime Visual Mission Simulator (MVMS) and the Lockheed Martin Operations Analysis Systems Integrated Simulator (OASIS) Operations Center (OPCEN) Simulator Training Suite via a fully-compatible interface.  The interface shall allow the Kongsberg Maritime Bridge Simulation MVMS and the OASIS OPCEN simulation training suite co-located at TRACEN Petaluma to operate as one fully functioning and integrated MVMS.  During all scenarios, the operator information display within the integrated MVMS shall replicate the display characteristics, interoperability, and functionality of the sensor panels and displays found on the NSC/WMSL Bridge and OPCEN.

2) The Contractor shall fully integrate the proprietary Kongsberg Maritime Simulation MVMS and Sperry Machinery Control and Monitoring System (MCMS) and Control and Display Unit (CDU) equipment to replicate the display characteristics, interoperability, and functionality of the sensor panels and displays found on the actual NSC/WMSL.

3) The Contractor shall fully integrate the MTU bridge propulsion system components and proprietary Kongsberg Maritime Simulation MVMS equipment to replicate the display characteristics, interoperability, and functionality of the sensor panels and displays found on the actual NSC/WMSL.  The provided Government furnished property will include existing MTU Detroit Diesel bridge equipment such as Engine telegraph panels; control levers; tachometers; pitch indicator meter and; engine control mode panels.

All written responses must include a written narrative of capability, including technical information demonstrating the contractor’s ability to meet the above requirements.  The responses must be sufficient for the Government to establish that the Contractor possesses a bona-fide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a non-competitive procurement with Kongsberg Maritime Simulation, Inc.  A determination by the Government to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 14 days after publication of this synopsis.  All information in responses to this notification must be submitted in writing or by email to jennifer.sokolower@uscg.mil.

<DESC><p>The 30th Contracting Squadron is publicizing this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE in order to gather industry information and input with respect to a potential Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) program at Vandenberg AFB, CA. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result. The Air Force will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. Any future solicitation, including specifications and/or drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/). Interested Parties are solely responsible for monitoring the aforementioned website for the release of a solicitation package and/or any updates and/or amendments.
<p>The government is seeking to identify qualified, experienced, and interested potential businesses capable of performing the type of work as described herein. The envisioned MACC program would consist of multiple, firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts to provide a vehicle for executing a broad range of maintenance, repair and new construction of buildings, facilities, or base infrastructure, performed under a design/build or just build process. In general, MACC program contractors would be given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and would be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Work may include full project design from a concept or performance-oriented statement of work. In-house design capability or ready access to design capability is a must for projects under MACC.

<p>The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that as many as ten (10) contracts could be awarded, each for a term consisting of one base year plus four, 1-year option periods. Task Orders written against MACC contracts are anticipated to range between $2,000 and $7,500,000. The overall program value is still under consideration; accordingly, at this point it is roughly anticipated to range between $100,000,000 and $200,000,000 over a five-year period.<br /><br />If your firm has an interest in proposing on future requirements as described above, please prepare and transmit a Capability Statement to Sharon May or David Hill via mail addressed to 30 CONS/LGCA, 1515 Iceland Ave, Bldg 8500, Room 150, Vandenberg AFB, CA 93437-5212, fax to (805) 606-5867, or email to sharon.may@vandenberg.af.mil and david.hill2@vandenberg.af.mil, not later than 4:00 PM PDT, 27 July 2009. If emailing your response, please note that due to increased firewall protections some emails may be blocked; therefore, follow-up via telephone (if an acknowledgement is not received back via email) is strongly recommended to ensure receipt of your submission by the Government.</p>
<p>Request Capability Statements address the following:</p>

Identify specialty construction trades performed with company employees, if any, as well as experience in delivering multi-trade design-build projects.</p>
<p>6. In-house Architect and Engineering (Up to 100%) design capability or ready access to design capability.

<DESC>Magnetspheric Multiscale (MMS) ProjectCommunication System RF AntennaRequest for InformationTHIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR AN INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.OverviewMMS is a constellation of 4 Earth orbiting satellites that require S-Band RFcommunications to support tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C).  Each satellite is spinstabilized about the z axis and requires two antennas, one each, to support the nadirand zenith antenna fields of view.  These antennas have been assigned locations on topand bottom spacecraft decks (normal to the spin axis) out near the spacecraftperiphery.  NASA in-house analysis has determined both the top and bottom antennasshare identical mechanical, environmental and RF performance requirements.  In general each MMS antenna is no taller than 12 inches and no wider than 6 inches indiameter, with total mass not to exceed 1 kg.  The electrical interface is expected to bea coaxial cable routed from below the interface/mounting plate.  MMS orbital contactanalysis mandates each antenna provides a normal mode slightly tilted toroidal shaperadiation pattern.  The antenna will be expected to maintain required performance duringspacecraft I&T, environmental tests, through the launch environment and three years offull sun/full shade space environment with no active thermal controls.	 Specialconsideration must also be given to the missions stringent magnetic and electrostaticcleanliness requirements. The MMS project is currently past PDR and is preparing for CDR in mid 2010.The RFP, when released, will direct the potential vendors to provide the flightRF/mechanical/environmental/thermal designs, development, fabrication, assembly, testingand qualification, program for the delivery of eight (8) flight qualified, oneproto-flight qualified, plus one engineering test unit antennas. Requested ResponseThe scope of the RFI work requests the prospective vendors to evaluate the attached draftAntenna RFI Specification for RF, mechanical and environmental requirements.  The MMSproject requests that interested parties provide NASA responses and suggestions as to howtheir technical capabilities can best achieve these antenna requirements for the mission.The MMS project is interested with responses that closely match or exceed these missionrequirements.  The Agency and the NASA Solar Terrestrial Probes Programs are both veryinterested in learning of potential technology developments that could benefit futureNASA Missions.The MMS mission requests the following deliveries under  this RFI:1.  A report summarizing a proposed antenna design including a matrix showing estimatedcompliance with the antenna RF performance requirements.a.  The report should discuss, in general, the designs ability to meet the mechanicaland environmental requirements.b.  The report shall provide mechanical drawing(s) in sufficient detail to allow NASA tounderstand the proposed design.c.  The mechanical drawing(s) shall indicate all proposed antenna and radome dielectricmaterials and/or coatings.d.  The report should show any previous flight heritage that may be inherent to theproposed design.2.  Provide ROM estimates for the fight procurement including cost breakdown as well asschedule estimates ARO.   Discuss the minimum-cost vs. minimum-risk method of achievingthe requirements of the mission.  Leading cost drivers should be identified to ensure abalanced approach to performance and cost. 3.  Discuss any other methods, options or technologies you believe of benefit to MMS andSolar Terrestrial Probes programs. Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as proprietaryunless otherwise indicated.   Please clearly mark all proprietary documents. No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information.

<p><br />The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is requesting information to determine the availability of interested businesses to compete for a contract that will provide support for the preparation of the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) and the background documents used in its scientific review process. The RoC is a Congressionally mandated document that identifies and discusses agents, substances, mixtures, or exposure circumstances (collectively referred to as "substances") that may pose a hazard to human health by virtue of their carcinogenicity.  The responsibility for preparing the RoC has been delegated to the National Toxicology Program. (NTP). Substances that are being considered by the NTP for possible listing or de-listing in the RoC (here referred to as candidate substances) are evaluated by a rigorous review process. Each background document summarizes all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for a candidate substance. The goal of this contract is to provide support of NTP hazard identification activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents.</p>
<p><br />The propose contract tasks include: the preparation of the background documents and the preparation of the RoC. Both shall be measured by end products.   The Contractor shall conduct literature searches, draft technical summaries or reviews of the literature in textual and/or tabular format, checks the technical accuracy of the information, performs copy and scientific editing, and formats and compiles the information into a background document.  For some background documents, the Contractor may need to establish subcontracts with expert consultants (identified by the NTP RoC office) to draft or provide advice for sections in which the Contractor does not have adequate expertise.

<DESC>Market Research and Request for Information (RFI)For the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Capability (HAAWC) Weapon System
FAR Part 10 requires the Government to conduct market research before developing new solicitation requirements for an acquisition. Results of market research are used to determine whether qualified sources exist and to obtain industry comments and information on future procurements.
One of the ways the Government conducts market research is to issue a Request for Information (RFI). An RFI provides a broad statement of need, briefly describes the Government's intentions regarding program/acquisition approach, and identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule. In addition, the announcement requests industry comments on how the Government can satisfy its needs, alternative approaches, technology availability and risk, the identification of cost drivers, and suggestions on ways to enhance or sustain competition.
Description:Program Executive Office (PEO) Submarines, Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404), issues this RFI to help determine the technical capability and qualifications of companies in meeting the Government's needs for development of an Air Launch Accessory (ALA) for use in launching MK 54 Torpedo from P-8A Poseidon Aircraft.  
This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only and part of market research and will not be shared outside of the Government. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor responses to this announcement. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  When/if the Government issues an RFP, interested contractors will be expected to thoroughly address the requirements thereof regardless of the circumstances surrounding this RFI.
Development Contract Concept and Background:The Department of the Navy has contracted Boeing to develop and manufacture the P-8A Poseidon Aircraft.  The program is in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase of the Defense Acquisition Process with the first flight worthy aircraft projected to be delivered to the Navy in 2009.  The P-8A will carry the MK 54 Torpedo as an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) weapon.  The MK 54 Torpedo is in the Production and Deployment Phase of the Defense Acquisition Process in Full Rate Production.  The MK 54 Torpedo is currently produced by Raytheon.  The legacy Air Launch Accessories (ALA) used for launch of MK 54 Torpedo from P-3C Aircraft that results in parachute aided freefall will be utilized for initial P-8A launch capability.
PMS404 desires to award a contract in the 2010 calendar year for design and development of an ALA to be used in conjunction with the MK-54 Torpedo to increase standoff range and weapon release envelope for P-8A launch.  The combination of the MK 54 Torpedo and new ALA will comprise the High Altitude ASW Weapon Capability (HAAWC) weapon system.  HAAWC developmental testing must be sufficiently complete to align use of HAAWC with P-8A Poseidon Increment 2 testing scheduled for 2013.  
PMS404 is issuing this RFI to gain an understanding of industry's technical capabilities, knowledge and experience level with this type of development.   The Navy is seeking sources that can provide technical and manufacturing capabilities for design, system integration, hardware and software production, and tests, all of which incorporate comprehensive quality processes and maximize the use of open system architecture. 
HAAWC Design Objectives and Technical References:The primary HAAWC objective is to increase the standoff range and weapon release altitude of the P-8A Poseidon Aircraft during ASW missions.  The Navy desires a standoff range of 20 nautical miles or greater at a release altitude of at least 20,000 feet at speeds of greater than 350 knots indicated air speed (KIAS).  Additionally, the ALA shall also allow for release as low as 500 feet at speeds as low as 250 KIAS.  The ALA will be used exclusively with the MK 54 Torpedo and be carried and released from the Aft Weapons Bay of the P-8A Poseidon. The Navy envisions a capacity to carry and release 5 HAAWC weapons from the P-8A.  The ALA must have a MIL-STD-1760 electrical interface to allow data transfer from the P-8A Poseidon Station Control Unit.  The current MK-54 interfaces will be utilized for transferring Mk-54 Torpedo preset data through the fire control interface.  It is envisioned that the ALA will increase the placement accuracy of the MK 54 by guiding the torpedo to its water entry point with no more than a 30 meter (Circular Error Probable) and release the torpedo within the current requirements for MK-54 release envelope.   
The Navy is contemplating an additional objective for HAAWC to have the ability to receive in-flight mid-course targeting updates and torpedo presets after release from the P-8A aircraft, thus a data link may be required. 
Additional technical information will be made available to qualified potential respondents of the RFI upon request.  Information available may include P-8A weapon bay information showing available volumes and bomb rack locations, and a MK-54 Torpedo drawing package for control of external interfaces.
Requested Information:Respondent is requested to provide information on the following:
a)	Describe your capabilities, experience and knowledge of air delivered weapons systems.  Provide a summary of your past experience with development programs leading to a Production and Deployment phase.
b)	Describe your systems engineering capabilities/experience and knowledge, along with risk management, configuration management, quality processes, lean six sigma, and scheduling, and define your experience on similar programs.
c)	Describe your technical and manufacturing capabilities/knowledge to achieve the objectives of a development program
d)	Describe your capabilities and experience with, and availability of test equipment or test facilities that may be required to support development and test objectives
e)	Provide a summary of your past teaming arrangements, vendor management processes, and your experience with managing complex integrated system design
f)	Describe your capabilities and experience with, and knowledge of, program management including earned value management, manufacturing, test requirements, and vendor qualification and oversight, specifically addressing necessary personnel skills and resources available.
g)	Describe your capabilities and experience with, and knowledge of, life cycle supportability.

<CONTACT>Stephanie M. Garnett, Phone 8085353473, Email stephanie.m.garnett@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the government. The United States Coast Guard (USCG), Civil Engineering Unit (CEU), has a future requirement for fungal detoxification of PCB-contaminated soils at the former Long Range Navigation (LORAN) station at Kure Atoll The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for work of this nature is 562211(Size Standard: $12.5 million). The government is seeking potential contractors with the ability to provide fungal detoxification of PCB contaminated soil using a  fungi-bearing hydrogel formulation that: 1) can support the growth and propagation of mycelia of saprophytic fungi collected from Hawaiian rain forests; and 2) can degrade recalcitrant contaminants including PCBs, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and diesel fuel.  The Coast Guard wishes to apply this hydrogel formulation to Kure landfill soils, in order to evaluate its PCB-degrading ability.

In a future requirement, the successful Contractor will be required to provide the necessary services, personnel, facilities, equipment, and material (except those specifically designated as Government-furnished) to perform the work and provide scientific and technical expertise for the areas described herein.  All work will be conducted in strict compliance with EPA regulations (40 CFR 761), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) standards (29 CFR 1910 and 1926), and State of Hawaii regulations.

The successful Contractor will be responsible for coordinating all phases of work with all Federal, State, Coast Guard personnel and all subcontractors, to ensure implementation of the project, and shall strive to meet its purpose and objectives.  This will include, but not limited to, meetings, conference calls, clearances, and other coordination activities necessary for successful completion of this scope of work.  

The successful Contractor will be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits, permit equivalents and certifications; and shall meet the substantive regulatory requirements necessary for the construction, operation and closure of the project.  If at all possible, the successful Contractor shall obtain permits under the “permit-by-rule” requirements to expedite the permitting process for this demonstration project.

The successful Contractor must be able to provide a pilot-scale study with the referenced fungi-induced bioremediation (mycoreremediation).  The successful Contractor must be able to demonstrate the process and effectiveness of mycoreremediation to 1) degrade PCB soil contamination resulting from past operations at Kure; and 2) reduce soil PCB concentrations to acceptable human health and ecological levels.  One specific area of interest will be to assess the effectiveness of the fungi to biodegrade PCBs to cleanup levels based on environmental exposure criteria (e.g., the State of Hawaii Environmental Action Level of 1.1 parts per million), within the proposed treatment period.  

The government contemplates the award of a firm fixed-price contract resulting from the future solicitation. Market Research is being conducted to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary, the government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the government. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and/or amendments, will be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this sources-sought announcement. The response date for the market survey is May 25, 2009. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the Market Survey will be accepted. All responses to the Market Survey Questionnaire may be submitted via email to Contract Specialist, Stephanie Garnett at Stephanie.M.Garnett@uscg.mil.   Please note: All contractors doing business with the Federal Government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for registration is www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>Renewing Service Plan for Thermo IdentiFinder Isotope Identification Devices
<SOLNBR>SAQMMA09M1384

<CONTACT>Vincent J Sanchez, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-875-6629, Fax 703-875-6006, Email SanchezVJ@state.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of State currently has approximately 125 Thermo IdentifFinder, radioactive isotope identification devices, deployed at 112 select posts worldwide.  These devices included a service plan which is expiring soon.  This notice is for informational purposes only, as it is the Department's intent to renew the service plan for these devices so we can maintain optimal functionality of the units already deployed in the field throughout the year at the estimated price of $67,000.00 to Thermo Eberline LLC.  Thus far in addition to the general calibration and inspection of detectors which this service plan includes, the current service plan has repaired over 30 damaged units in the past years.  The replacement cost for these damaged units would have been approximately $360,000 without the service plan in place to cover these parts under warranty the Government might not have seen such exceptional savings over this time period.  The unit cost to replace each IdentiFinder with a new or comparable unit is approximately $12,000.00 for each unit for a total estimated $1.5 million dollars.  The estimated cost to re-deploy new units including the administrative costs of coordinating the re-deployment and any associated re-training costs that would have to be added is greater and would be millions of dollars.  The existing devices in the field currently meet all needs, are in overall acceptable condition for use and it has been determined that renewing the service plan associated with these devices is more cost effective at this time then replacing the existing devices currently in use worldwide.  

THIS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR PROPOSAL, ANY INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THE POINT OF CONTACT LISTED ON THIS NOTICE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.   The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with  interested parties responding to this notice or for any submittals of information that may be received by the Government in response to this notice.

<CONTACT>Melvin N. Fondue, Phone (206) 526-6043, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure the &nbsp;services of&nbsp;Dr. James Joseph&nbsp;for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, (NMFS), Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFC)&nbsp; located in LaJolla, CA to collect cost data for tropical tuna purse seine vessels in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to 206-526-6025 or email (melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov) . This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Background Information</p>
<p>The research project is a follow-up activity to the recent World Bank-IATTC workshop on rights-based management and buybacks in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). One of the recommendations of the workshop was to develop a bioeconomic model of the tuna fisheries of the ETP that provides the optimum economic rent if the fishery were managed in such a manner, such as rights-based fishing. Buy-in to rights-based management will be facilitated if parties to the IATTC (Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission) have a benchmark optimum rent. Without a counter-factual to continued open access, demonstrating the gains in profits and resource rents under rights-based management is very difficult.</p>
<p>The bioeconomic results, indicating the optimum resource rent possible under rights-based management, will be used by Jim Joseph (former IATTC Director), Robin Allen (former IATTC Director), Guillermo Compean (current IATTC Director) for a meeting in Panama sponsored by the Panamanian purse seine industry and the World Tuna Purse Seine Owners Association. The results will also be used in scientific meetings and plenary sessions of the IATTC. The results will also be used by the Board of Directors and in the Scientific Committee of the new tuna processing industry NGO, International Sustainable Seafood Foundation (ISSF) (Joseph is Chair of the Scientific Committee and Squires is the economist on the Scientific Committee).</p>
<p>Construction of the bioeconomic model requires cost data for the vessels harvesting tropical tunas in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Collection of this cost is the subject of this contract with Dr. Joseph.</p>
<p>Work to Be Accomplished</p>
<p>Dr. James Joseph will collect confidential cost data for Class 5 and Class 6 purse seine vessels harvesting tropical tunas in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. The sample vessels will be flagged in member states of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and will harvest tropical tunas (bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack) by either: (1) setting on dolphins; (2) unassociated sets; (3) setting on floating aggregator devices. Joseph will collect cost data that are sensitive business information in a highly competitive commodity business fraught with inter-state competition among IATTC members. The data will be collected from various vessel owners, summarized and inspected for data quality issues and missing data. As required, Dr. Joseph will contact vessel owners for clarification, further information, etc. The final data will be summarized and reported electronically in an Excel spreadsheet. Dr. Joseph will retain unique identifiers for each source of data.</p>
<p>Task 1 will require working with contractor (Squires) and other economists to construct cost categories.</p>
<p>Task 2 will require contacting vessel owners and collecting requisite cost data.</p>
<p>Task 3 will summarize data, inspect for irregularities, missing data, data quality issues, and other related issues. Dr. Joseph will then seek clarification of the data to resolve these issues.</p>
<p>Task 4 will summarize the data in an Excel spreadsheet by method of fishing: (1) setting on dolphins; (2) unassociated sets; (3) setting on floating aggregator devices. Summary data will then be reported to contractor</p>

<SOLNBR>JASPO2011Submission
<RESPDATE>090109
<CONTACT>Ryan M. Delaney, Phone 3017576528, Email ryan.delaney@navy.mil
<DESC>This notice constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as contemplated by FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii).  

AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,     
TEST & EVALUATION (RDT&E) PROJECTS

I.  	INTRODUCTION:

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) is seeking information about industry’s research and development efforts for aircraft survivability.  These industry efforts are of significant interest to the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) community in planning for future JASP projects to assess industry capability to meet Government technology goals in this area.  This RFI is being issued prior to our annual project proposal call to US Government (USG) agencies to allow time for coordination between respondents to this RFI and potential FY11 project proposals submitted by USG agencies.  This notice is part of the Government’s on-going market research to understand industry’s current capabilities.  The information provided below is not specific to Government requirements as contemplated by FAR parts 14 and 15, but are areas of general interest to allow industry to better inform the Government as to industry’s present efforts as those efforts relate to aircraft survivability.  

II.	BACKGROUND:

Originally chartered as the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Aircraft Survivability (JTCG/AS), the JASP has been actively pursuing technologies to support aircraft survivability and coordinate aircraft related survivability issues between the Services for over 30 years. The JASP is a government funded program reporting to the Office of Secretary of Defense/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD/DOT&E) and chartered by the Services aviation systems commands.  The day-to-day operation of the JASP is under the direction of the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO).  JASP is a tri-Service program whose mission is to achieve increased affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of aircraft through the joint coordination and development of survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability reduction) technologies and assessment methodologies.   

Annually, JASP issues a call to USG agencies for research efforts and funds approximately $3M in new start projects and $6M in continuing projects.  JASP projects typically last 1-3 years and receive between $100-200K per year with a potential maximum funding level of $500K per year.  A key tenant of the JASP program is the leveraging of JASP funding with funding from other sources and applicability of our projects to more than a single platform.
 
JASP issues its call for project proposals via e-mail directly to USG agencies.   JASP does not directly fund contractor efforts but provides funding to USG agencies for project management and contracting, thus the requirement for US government sponsorship.  Consequently, this notice is not a request for submission of proposals, but strictly informational.  Contractors may elect to and are encouraged to directly contact appropriate USG agencies for sponsorship at any time.

III. 	SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:

The JASP research interests are organized into three subgroups: Susceptibility Reduction, Vulnerability Reduction and Survivability Assessment (Modeling & Simulation). The JASP is interested in industry research initiatives that will enhance the combat survivability of both manned and unmanned aircraft.  Its principal focus is Science and Technology (S&T) for advanced technology/component development and demonstration RDT&E (6.3) as well as improving the JASP’s modeling and simulation tool set.  Of particular interest are technologies with a near-term focus (less than 2 years) addressing immediate aircraft and occupant survivability concerns and requirements emerging from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.    Other areas of interest are listed below by subgroup category:
Susceptibility Reduction
Advanced development proof-of-design concepts are sought that will offer clear, quantifiable benefits in reducing the probability of military aircraft being hit by enemy fire.  Such concepts should lead to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 5 or 6 and may range from ideas for improving operational suitability of existing susceptibility reduction systems (cost and weight reduction, increased reliability) to ideas for entirely new capabilities.  Descriptions of research efforts from across the spectrum of susceptibility reduction technologies are invited (e.g., IR, visual, ultra-violet, acoustic signature reduction, etc.) but the JASP has particular interest in the following:

•	Technologies or concepts that, if developed successfully, would significantly benefit operational units in the near-term by solving an immediate need or capability gap (e. g., IR decoy flares that reduce an aircraft’s visual signature without impairing countermeasures effectiveness).
•	Technologies that improve blue force survivability through increased Situational Awareness (SA).  Although the benefit of enhanced SA is difficult to quantify, technologies that improve SA have the potential to increase the effectiveness of existing Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), as well as improve or modify Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) (e.g., Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) for gunfire).
•	 Technologies or concepts that will defeat current and future generation multi-spectral (i.e. infrared, visible and ultra-violet) threats such as MANPADs, imaging seekers, and search and track systems.  Such technologies or concepts include low cost approaches to multi-spectral missile countermeasures and warning or entirely new concepts.
•	Technologies or concepts that will counter advanced coherent, parameter-agile radar threats employed against both manned and unmanned military aircraft.  Threats could include advanced radars and passive radars.  Technologies could include electronic attack and electronic protection techniques.



Vulnerability Reduction

Emphasis should be on technologies/techniques that increase an aircraft’s capability to withstand the man-made hostile aviation environment (holistic approach to threat tolerance or aircraft hardening).  A balance between technologies/techniques that are breakthrough in nature (with potentially high risk, high payoff gains within longer timeframes), and technologies/techniques that are mature enough to transition into near-term, fieldable systems is desired.  In addition to the hit tolerance and aircraft hardening aspects of vulnerability reduction, added importance should be on technologies/techniques that reduce fatalities and injuries due to crash, hard landings, and egress.  Vulnerability reduction areas of emphasis include, but are not limited to: 

•	Opaque and transparent ballistic protection systems
•	Fuel containment protection (leakage mitigation) for tanks and lines
•	Fire suppression/extinguishing systems (passive and active)
•	Crew and passenger casualty (injury and fatality) reduction
•	Damage tolerant & repairable subsystems
•	Advanced materials development
•	Engine (jet and turboshaft) vulnerability reduction technologies and concepts
•	Systems that protect the aircraft, crew, and passengers from flare and munition reactions
•	MANPADS and RPG damage effects mitigation
•	Optimize and maximize test data collection for modeling and simulation enhancement and validation/verification (V&V)

Survivability Assessment

Improve the capability and credibility of government-owned survivability Models and Simulations (M&S), focusing on M&S residing in the Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC).  Other M&S providing capabilities beyond those of the SURVIAC are also of interest, and will be considered on a case by case basis.

&#61607;	CAPABILITY:
•	Tools that can evaluate/predict aircraft combat crash causes, conditions and occupant effects.
•	Robust signature, countermeasure and environment modeling
•	Vulnerability phenomena of conventional, unconventional and asymmetric threats
•	Authoritative blue system performance data (including vulnerability)
•	Integration of authenticated threat models from the Intelligence Centers
•	Geometric target modeling and interrogation

&#61607;	CREDIBILITY:
•	Confirm/increase credibility of SURVIAC models based on open-air range data or other authoritative data 
•	Better understanding of  assumptions and limitations of survivability models leading to recommendations for future investment strategies

&#61607;	Usability
•	Projects that enhance the user interfaces of JASP M&S tools to reduce errors or enhance the ability to verify the code.

IV.   	SUBMISSION OF PROJECT IDEAS:
This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) but rather a Request for Information (RFI) on your current survivability research and development efforts and other ideas that may be of interest to the JASP.  This will be the only JASP request for survivability information prior to the project proposals call to US government agencies in September 2009.  Government requests for proposals will be issued by the individual services and describe the Government requirements that the contractor proposal submissions must address along with proposal submission requirements and basis for selection of competitive contractor proposals.  A decision not to submit informational paper in response to this RFI does not preclude participation in these individual service competitive research announcements. 
NAVAIRSYSCOM will acknowledge receipt of your response and forward to the appropriate JASPO subgroup Technical Point of Contact (TPOC).  The JASPO will review submitted responses for compatibility with the JASP mission and at their discretion, contact the submitter for further information.  If an idea is deemed of sufficient interest to the Government, the submitter (or their selected representatives) will be directed to an appropriate military service for submission of a FY11 project proposal through a selected US government sponsor for possible JASP funding through a competitive announcement publicized in accordance with the requirements of the FAR.  This does not preclude a source from submitting a proposal to an appropriate military service pursuant to other procedures available under the FAR and agency supplemental procedures.

You are required to follow the instructions provided in this notice for the submittal.  Submitted information packages will be forwarded by the Contracts Office to the JASPO

SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS:

All proprietary material in the submission package shall be clearly identified and will be treated in the strictest confidence.  Submissions are limited to US companies and must be unclassified.

<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the intention to competitively award a Task Order from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 25. The period of performance will be from August 17, 2009 though September 27, 2010.</p>
<p>The contractor is to conduct a Combined Phase II Environmental Assessment at the subject properties in accordance with ASTM E-1903-97 (2002) "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process". In addition, conduct an Underground Storage Tank (UST) Removal and a Closure Assessment according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Storage Tank System Closure Assessment Requirements in Chapter 67-761, and Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.). If the tanks are found to have leaked and residual contamination remains, a site-specific Analysis of Brownfields Cleanup Alternatives (ABCA) describing clean up options and cost estimates for the clean up will be tasked. The subject properties are the Petrol Mart, 625 South Collins Street, Plant City, Hillsborough County, Florida and the Ramco Service Center, 401 South Collins Street, Plant City, Hillsborough County, Florida.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO EXISTING CONTRACTHOLDERS. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to add the installation of five (5) sets of playground equipment within five (5) different recreation areas.  The playground equipment is being purchased by a separate competitively awarded contract.  The work will include removing some outdated equipment and installing all of the new equipment.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all five of these recreation areas.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables installation to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>The Stratton VA Medical Center, located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany, NY, is soliciting for a contract for Architect/Engineer (A/E) services.  This procurement will be conducted following the procedures outlined in FAR 36.6, and specifically 36.602-5 for shortened selection procedures.  This means that interested firms are to submit a standard form 330 (available via the GSA forms library at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF) in hard or electronic copy for shortlist evaluation based on the standard VA Construction and Facilities Management scoresheet (blank copies are available upon request for reference purposes).  Selection will be made by the chairperson of the selection board based entirely on these initial submissions and oral presentations will NOT be conducted.The intent of the contract design shall be to perform investigative analysis and design and produce working drawings and specifications necessary for the award of a contract to replace the burners and controls on the three main boilers in Building 4, the Boiler Plant,  and replace various boiler control systems in the main steam generation plant in the hospital.  Boilers are nominal 800 hp water tube style with dual fuel burners. Included in the scope of the architect/engineer services are the study and design for variable frequency drive and inverter duty motor installations on the combustion blowers, complete system and modifications necessary for installation of mud drum steam heaters and incorporation of blow down heat recovery including equipment, piping and controls.  Boiler combustion burner and combustion control system to be based on current best practices incorporating automatic Oxygen trim, linkless controls with electric actuation, PLC based controls, combustion flame and fuel safety systems, automatic change-over between fuel sources (Natural Gas, No.2 Fuel Oil and No. 4 Fuel Oil) and automated emissions monitoring. Modification of the boiler mud drums for incorporation of steam drum heaters requires compliance with ASME guidelines and requirements for the modification of a fired pressure vessel and associated piping systems. Work is primarily mechanical engineering with other engineering disciplines, including but not limited to electrical engineering.  In evaluating offers received for past performance and technical capability, specific weight will be given to work of a similar scope and proposed team members with specific background experience in this type of boiler engineering work.There will be an enforced geographic restriction on eligible offerors of 30 miles from the Stratton VA due to the necessity for frequent site visits during both design and construction.The VA has not specified a socio-economic set-aside for this project, but is willing to consider one based on a cascading system of preference.  Per the Brooks Act, three firms deemed technically acceptable must be evaluated in order to proceed towards award, and as such three acceptable offers from one socio-economic category MUST be received to consider a set-aside.  Technically acceptable shall be defined as a rating of 60 or higher out of 146 possible points.  The order of preference for socio-economic set-asides as is follows:1.	Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business2.	Veteran-Owned Small Business3.	HUBZONE Business4.	8a/Woman-Owned5.	Large Business (unrestricted/no set-aside).As this procurement falls under the small business competitiveness demonstration program, a set-aside for general small business will not be considered.The cost of construction for the resulting construction project is estimated to be valued between $500,000 and $750,000

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is in need of support for analytical demands requiring Bacterial Endotoxin Testing.  The Endosafe PTS is the newest endotoxin detection product.  It is a rapid; point-of-use test system that utilizes existing FDA licensed LAL reagents in a test cartridge with a hand-held spectrometer.  The PTS can effectively be used to obtain fast, quantitative LAL test results at the point of sample collection.  The assessment of samples in multiple locations can be completed efficiently and accurately.  Also reagents have a short storage life once opened and can expire before another sample is analyzed.  The lack of the Endosafe-PTS equipment would jeopardize the sample analysis, and increase the cost of running Bacterial Endotoxin Test.  

CHARACTERISTICS

The device is licensed by the FDA as an alternative to traditional LAL testing methods for in-process and final product release testing.  The PTS utilizes kinetic chromogenic methodology by measuring color intensity directly related to the endotoxin concentration in a sample.  Each cartridge contains precise amounts of licensed LAL reagent, chromogenic substrate and control standard endotoxin.  The cartridges are manufactured in a qualified class 100,000 GMP manufacturing area according to rigid quality control procedures ensuring test accuracy and product stability. The PTS instrument is a lightweight, incubating spectrophotometer that has many features which includes a rechargeable power block, easy to read display screen, keypad operation, storage of 100 test results, data transfer ability to standard reports and trending software applications, printable results, and protective case with cover. The speed of the device creates an effective range of product applications, which includes pharmaceutical, biological, nuclear medicine samples, dialysis samples, stem cell materials, laboratory water systems, cleaning validations, and medical devices.  The high performance device performs well above other innovative devices, and very effective due to various advantages.  The following is a list of the device advantages:

•Portable, hand held LAL test system

•Fast results at sample collection sites

•Simple, one button operation

•Single step, quantitative LAL test

•Results in about 15 minutes

•LAL test components all included

•Detects between 0.05-5 EU/mL and 0.10-1 EU/mL

•Data downloadable to a central PC

The surface of the paperboard must hold a piece of weighted pressure sensitive tape securely in place for at least ten (10) minutes in 6 out of 9 trials, when tested according to ASTM D286-90, Procedure B Modified as follows:

2.8.1	Use a three quarter inch (¾”) wide, office pressure sensitive tape to conduct the test.

2.8.2	Adhere the tape to the paperboard surface with two (2) rolls of a 10kg steel roller.

2.8.3	Suspend a two 2 ounce weight from the tape.

2.9	Thickness.  The paperboard thickness must be 0.060 inches plus or minus 0.005 inches, when tested according to TAPPI T-411 om-4.

2.10 	Stiffness.  The paperboard must have an internal stiffness of at least 1,800 Tabor stiffness units in the machine direction and 800 Tabor stiffness units in the cross direction at 15 degrees deflection, when tested according to TAPPI T-489om-86.

2.11 	Finish.  The paperboard must be plated finished (calendered) on both sides.

2.12 	Color Retention.  Dyes used to color the paperboard must show no bleeding when soaked in distilled water for 48 hours while held in direct contact with white bond paper.  The board must not show a loss or gain of more than five (5) points of brightness after exposure in a Sunlighter II apparatus for 96 hours or a fadeometer for 36 hours, when tested according to APPI T-452om-87. 

2.13 	Adhesive.  Water resistant adhesive must be used when laminating two or more thicknesses of paperboard together to form a single board of the required thickness.  When aged in an oven at 50 degrees centigrade and 87 percent relative humidity, the adhesive must not soften or run, bust must hold the two or more thicknesses of paperboard firmly together.  The properties of the adhesive must not detract from the properties of the paperboard (i.e., reduce the alkaline reserve, increase the percentage of sulfur, decrease the pH, or decrease the stiffness).  The adhesive must not be visible through or alter the color of the paperboard.  If it is necessary to buffer the adhesive, the same buffer as in the paperboard (i.e., calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, or a combination of both) must be used.

2.14 	Metal Edge Stay

2.14.1 	General Information.  A metal edge stay must be used to securely fasten together the joints of the box and lid (see Attachment 1, Archives Box).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(DC)-2009-216 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). 

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33. 

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures,  Subpart 13.5 —Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Part 12—Acquisition of Commercial Items.  

The acquisition is a total small business set-aside.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 334516 – Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500 employees.

Market research conducted by the Government through the issuance of a sources sought small business synopsis posted in the FedBizOpps on June 26, 2009 has determined that there is a reasonable expectation of receiving two (2) or more offers from small business third-party resellers that are capable of providing the equipment listed herein of a large business manufacturer.  Therefore, the acquisition method is a total small business set-aside.

This requirement is for the acquisition of a brand name only laboratory instruments manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA 94547, a large business.   The Bio-Rad Laboratories brand instruments were selected for this requirement in order to maintain the continuity of the research conducted.   Current research is performed using Bio-Rad Laboratories brand instruments and reagents and the introduction of another manufacturer’s instruments would require the use of that manufacturer’s reagents.   The introduction of another manufacturer’s reagents or the use of reagents outside of the lots previously used would introduce new variables and jeopardize the research’s continuity.   Specifically, the SYBR green Universal PCR mastermix and ISCRPT cDNA reagents are continually required on an ongoing basis for shared use by multiple members of the Laboratory.   The reagents must be the same lot as previously ordered, because each manufacturer produces SYBR-green Master mixes and Reverse transcription kits, with different and often proprietary reagents.  The research must continue using identical reagents. Changing variables at this time would jeopardize experimental continuity, which is critical with the sensitivity of these reagents and the years of previous gene expression analysis we have done. Our experiments absolutely require the use of an identical supplier for ongoing experiments using the Bio-Rad Laboratories reagents.   Therefore, because only Bio-Rad Laboratories instruments are able to use Bio-Rad Laboratories reagents only the Bio-Rad Laboratories’ instruments can satisfy this requirement. 

The following items are being acquired:
1.  Bio-Rad Laboratories Part #: 1855096, CFX96 Real-Time PCR System, Quantity: Three (3) each.

2.  Bio-Rad Laboratories Part #: 1707369, Computer PC Laptop.  Quantity: Two (2) each.  

3.  Bio-Rad Laboratories Part #: 1855096WSA, SCA CFX96 RT PCR DET SYS.  Quantity: Two (2) each.

The date of delivery and installation is fifteen (15) calendar days after the award of the contract.  The FOB point is Destination and the acceptance point is Bethesda, Maryland.

The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors — Commercial, applies to this acquisition. 

The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation — Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The proposals will be evaluated on price and delivery. 

Each offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items, with its offer. 

The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions — Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  — Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

Proposals are due on July 20, 2009, at 4:00 p.m. local prevailing time,  in a “read-only” electronic format via e-mail to hawkinsd@nhlbi.nih.gov citing the solicitation number  NHLBI-PB(DC)-2009-216”  and the name of firm in the subject line.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION NOTICE.   This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB(HL)-2009-211/GMV

This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).

This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million.  

The acquisition is being conducted as a  Small Business Set-Aside..  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541990 and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars.

The proposed period of performance is for twelve (12) months.  

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA),  for the  intends to award a single, fixed priced purchase order for the service of RNA extraction (cell pellets) for the Biomark Discovery in NHLBI’s Framingham Heart Study.  

Brief History/Purpose/Description of Project:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and have become an American epidemic.

The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources. New diagnostic technologies, such as echocardiography (an ultrasound examination of the heart), carotid-artery ultrasound, bone densitometry (for monitoring osteoporosis), and computerized tomography of the coronary arteries, are evaluated and integrated into ongoing protocols.

While pursuing the study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas such as the role of genetic factors in CVD. Framingham investigators also collaborate with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects in stroke and dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutrition, diabetes, eye diseases, hearing disorders, lung diseases, and genetic patterns of common diseases.

The Framingham SABRe CVD Initiative will assess biomarkers in approximately 7000 Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohort participants. Thousands of biomarkers will be assessed using the following platforms: a) immunoassays, b) discovery and targeted proteomics, c) discovery and targeted metabolomics/lipomics, and WBC derived RNA expression. SABRe CVD represents an opportunity to conduct complex systems biology science on a population level. 

In this collaborative effort in biomarker discovery, the NHLBI genomics core has undertaken the biomarker discovery project for analysis of gene expression in approximately 7000 WBC  derived RNA samples using the Affymetrix Human Exon arrays to identify differentially expressed genes and associated alternative splicing.   

Specifically, the study will identify genes with altered expression in heart, lung, and blood disorders, and in parallel study alternative splicing events during the disease process. This study will be conducted in phases with the intent start analyzing gene expression in 2500 RNA samples from Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants.

Through bioinformatics approaches, the study will identify genes with expression levels that are associated with cis- or trans-acting SNPs, i.e. eSNPs.  Having a direct effect on the molecular profile, such eSNPs are thus more likely to have a causal relationship with other heart, lung, or blood related phenotypes than anonymous SNPs, thereby improving the statistical power for identification of SNP--phenotype associations genome-wide.   Further, advanced statistical techniques such as random forests will be used to build better predictive models combining both SNP and expression profile data.

This project involves isolation of microRNA enriched total RNA from cell pellets or whole blood.

I.	Contractor Requirements

The contractor shall perform the RNA isolation process on the 2,500 cell pellets or PaxGene samples.  The contractor shall quantitate the amount of RNA isolated from these samples and perform Quality Control (QC) on them to determine the RNA integrity. The contractor shall report the concentration of RNA per microliter and also provide the NHLBI the bioanalyzer traces with corresponding RNA integrity number for each of these samples.
   
A.  The contractor shall deliver the isolated total RNA + microRNA in 2 separate  aliquots.
B.  The contractor shall provide the details on the concentration of the isolated RNA (micrograms and ng per microliter), RNA integrity number, and the bioanalyzer trace on the integrity of the 18s and 28s ribosomal peaks.
C.   The contractor shall provide necessary technical support, during the sample processing step, and the required internal controls for use as a quality control measure.
D.  Optimized procedures are necessary for isolation of RNA from PaxGene tubes and cell pellets that permit higher quality RNA isolation with minimal reduction in RNA yield. 

II.  Government Responsibilities
   
NHLBI will inspect each sample based on the contractor’s report in reference to the RNA concentration and integrity.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format specified in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.&nbsp; This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(HG)-2009-227/MKL and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 621111, Offices of Physicians (except Mental Health Specialists), and the associated small business size standard is $10.0 million.&nbsp; This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.&nbsp; However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.&nbsp; It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to negotiate and award a contract, on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Hasan Albacha-Hejazi, M.D., Altal, Damascus 527 Syria, in support of the NHGRI protocol # OH97-HG-N035, gene study regarding heritable oral clefts.&nbsp; The anticipated period of performance will consist of one twelve (12) month basic contract period.</p>
<p>Market Research conducted by the Government, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that Dr. Albacha-Hejazi's clinic is one of only a few clinics able to collect data and biological specimens from families with a history of oral clefts.&nbsp; In order to ensure detection of all important genetic effects, data collection from multiple families and family members are needed to improve the power of the study.&nbsp; Dr. Hasan Albacha-Hejazi, of the IBN Al-Nafees Hospital in Damascus, Syria, has identified additional new families from Syrian individuals which will provide a larger sample pool.</p>
<p>The background, objectives, and scope of work is as follows:</p>
<p>Background: The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Division of Intramural Research's (DIR) overall mission is to develop and implement technology for the rapid isolation, analysis, and treatment of genetic diseases.&nbsp; The Division's research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to study the fundamental mechanisms of inherited and acquired genetic disorders.&nbsp; Research also includes planning and conducting clinical trials to test DNA-based methods for treatment and perhaps the cure of such diseases.&nbsp; Researchers collect and study families in which important diseases are inherited as well as, translate basic science advances into effective, reliable, and cost effective DNA and cytogenetic-based diagnostics.</p>
<p>The proposed contract covers work to be performed as part of a continued collaborative effort under revised protocol OH97-HG-N035 (most recently approved by the NHGRI Institutional Review Board on June 23, 2008).&nbsp; Dr. Hasan Albacha-Hejazi, of the IBN Al-Nafees Hospital in Damascus, Syria, shall collect data and biological specimens from individuals who are members of families determined to have multiple family members affected with hereditary oral clefts.&nbsp; The data collection has been very successful in the past, but additional families are needed to increase the power of the study.&nbsp; Dr. Hejazi has collected and shipped blood samples to NHGRI on a total of 51 Syrian families with multiple individuals affected with non-syndromic oral clefts.&nbsp; However, for a complex disorder such as oral clefts, a larger sample is needed to ensure detection of all important genetic effects.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective of the Procurement: The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the NHGRI researchers dedicated to the study of families with a history of oral clefts.&nbsp; The services will include the determination of eligibility, patient registration, clinical evaluation of family members, and biological sample collection and shipment.</p>
<p>The objective of the study is to identify the gene(s) involved in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of genes involved in causing inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance and pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
<p>Scope of Work: The Contractor shall engage in several activities, including: (1) determination of eligibility; (2) patient registration; (3) clinical evaluation of family members; and (4) data and biological sample collection and shipment.</p>

<DESC><p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />FSM-45PM Polarization Maintaining Fiber Splicer Kit
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NB815030-9-16218SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 334515. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item:<br />CLIN 0001 - Brand Name or Equal to FSM-45PM Polarization Maintaining Fiber Splicer Kit Model #S014339</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />CLIN 0001 - Brand Name or Equal to FSM-45PM Polarization Maintaining Fiber Splicer Kit Model #S014339 (includes Splicer V-Groove Cleaning Kit and SpliceLab Research and Development Software)</p>
<p>The following are specifications:<br />1. A requirement for this purchase is a Fiber fusion splicer using active core alignment and capable of splicing polarization maintaining (PM) fiber as well as different types of doped and specialty fibers. This fiber splicer will allow for development of a number of different fiber-based cw lasers, pulsed lasers, frequency combs and fiber systems which will be used as part of our effort to develop high repetition rate, low phase noise fiber-based systems to support the NIST IMS on precision timing and low phase noise microwave sources.<br />2. Fiber splicers are often temperamental. For proper and continued operation they require flexibility in their programming, care and cleaning by the user, and support from the manufacturer both in terms of software, upkeep, and new parts. Therefore, a significant factor in choosing our splicer is that we purchase it from an established splicer manufacturer with a solid history of developing splicers and with the expectation of continued support after the purchase of the splicer. <br />3. In order to develop high repetition rate lasers, NIST will need to make short cavities. The splice length is therefore often a limiting factor. A non-PM splicer can provide ~ 3 cm long splices. A PM splicer will have longer splices, but we need to keep this length to a minimum.<br />4. Reliable, high-quality splicing<br />5. Ability to make short splices</p>
<p>(VII) Place of delivery is FOB Destination to NIST, 325 Broadway, Bldg 22 Boulder, CO 80305. Required delivery is no later than 3 weeks after receipt of order; offerors shall state offered delivery ARO.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is N2310091023 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34.  This project is full and open under NAICS code 541620 for Acoustic Inventory and Monitoring Services as described herein.  Proposals shall be submitted for the following line item as follows:  quantity = 1, unit = job, unit price = ____, total = ____.
TITLE OF PROJECT:  Acoustic Inventory and Monitoring Services for Lake Meredith NRA Off-road Vehicle Management Plan/EISDESCRIPTION:  Part 1.  Introduction/Background
Lake Meredith was created by the construction of Sanford Dam on the Canadian River in the early 1960s.  The primary purpose of the Recreation Area is to allow impoundment and diversion of water for municipalities in the Texas Panhandle.  
Lake Meredith National Recreation Area has two areas of the park designated as off-road vehicle (ORV) areas; Rosita with approximately 1740 acres for (ORV) use and Blue Creek with 275 acres. Rosita is the riparian area of the Canadian River in the southern end of the park. Blue Creek ORV area is in Blue Creek riparian area that empties into Lake Meredith. These ORV areas were historically utilized by the local community for recreational use prior to the establishment of the Sanford Reservoir Project and Lake Meredith in 1965.  Rosita and Blue Creek were designated ORV areas by special regulation, 36 CFR  7.57, in the 1970s. 
Off-road vehicle use has changed drastically since the establishment of the special regulation  7.57. In the 1960s, ORV use consisted of a few river buggies made from old vehicles converted to operate in the river bottom. These vehicles were generally rail/frame vehicles with seats, windshield, engine, drive train, and modified tires. There were a few dirt bike motorcycles and a few surplus military vehicles. Four-wheel drive vehicles were not as prevalent during this time. They were specialty vehicles and usually were considered expensive.  Today, however, hundreds of ORV users come to Lake Meredith NRA to ride ATV and other off-road vehicles in the ORV areas.  Rosita Flats has become a destination for both local and regional users, with groups traveling to use the recreation area from as far away as Pueblo, Colorado.  Because of the invention of new off-road vehicles that are more powerful and versatile than the earlier versions used in the 1960s, ORV users often travel outside the boundaries established in CFR  7.57.  The NRA is currently in the process of addressing the current use and revising the existing rule if necessary through an ORV management plan and environmental impact statement.  Initial planning efforts identified soundscapes as a resource impacted by ORV use.  
In order to understand potential impacts to park resources and values from the noise generated by ORVs, NPS is seeking responses from qualified professionals to calculate natural ambient conditions based on existing NPS data collection and analysis protocols and model alternatives for ORV plan/EIS using noise modeling software. NPS acoustic data collection and analysis protocols are available from the NPS Natural Sounds Program, as well as ambient sound analysis software, which may be provided on request.
 Part 2.  Data Available for Work Analysis		Acoustic data as well as source identification and observer logs have been collected and are available for use to complete the tasks under this scope of work .  Acoustic and Meteorological data were collected in accordance with sections 3.0 and 4.0 of the NPS AASRMG.  Two 30-day data collection sessions occurred in two different seasons (November 2008 and February 2009) both containing 25 days of usable data (see AASRMG  5.1). (NPS protocols require 25 days usable data after processing as described in section 5.1 of the AASRMG). Additionally observer logging sites / source identification were recorded in accordance with section2.0 of the AASRMG. 
Part 3.  Services to be CompletedThe Contractor shall analyze the acoustic data collected and model alternatives for the ORV plan using noise modeling software as described below in Task 1-4.  
Task 1.  Calculate natural ambient sound metrics: Calculate natural ambient sound levels and other metrics in accordance with sections 5.2 and 5.3 of the AASRMG.  According to NPS Management Policies "The natural ambient sound level-that is, the environment of sound that exists in the absence of human-caused noise-is the baseline condition, and the standard against which current conditions in a soundscape will be measured and evaluated."  The NPS-provided acoustic data will be in a format compatible with NPS Natural Sounds Program ambient sound analysis software, which may be provided on request.  The ambient sound analysis software enables rapid user-identification of acoustic spectral patterns in order to classify sounds more efficiently (up to 8x faster) than a pure listening-based approach would permit.
Task 2.  Prepare an Acoustic Conditions Report that contains the results of the source identification/observer log analysis, natural ambient sound analysis and metric calculation:a.	Develop and submit an Acoustic Conditions Report that provides the results of the natural ambient analysis, source identification/observer log analysis, and ambient metric calculation. The Contractor shall assume one revision of this report and shall deliver the report electronically. This report shall not exceed 15 pages.
Task 3.  Model alternatives for ORV plan:  Predictive noise modeling will be performed using noise modeling software and off-road vehicle  (ORV) sound source data provided by the contractor.  Examples of noise modeling software include CadnaA, SoundPLAN, and NMSim.  The model results will be calculated for up to 4 alternatives to be identified and provided by Lake Meredith National Recreation Area staff.  The alternatives may include ORV operational details, operational area/route locations, and/or number of anticipated vehicles per hour for each area/route.  In addition, predicted ORV noise levels should be validated using measured sound levels and off-road vehicle counts obtained during logging sessions.  The Contractor shall deliver a Modeling report describing the modeling results. The Contractor shall assume one edit of this report.
Task 4.  Assist in the development of the ORV plan and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS):  Develop a SHORT description of both the natural ambient sound levels as well as the modeled sound levels for each alternative (up to 4 alternatives) to be used in Chapter 4, Environmental Consequences, of the EIS.  Other ambient metrics will also be described.  This report will be used as part of the environmental impact statement and should be developed from the Acoustic Conditions Report and Modeling Report described in tasks above. The Contractor shall assume one edit of this report and shall be delivered electronically. This description shall not exceed a total of 20 pages.
Part 4.  Schedule:  
The deliverables associated with Tasks 1 and 2, bulleted below, should be submitted to NPS for review within 70 days after the award of the modification. NPS will take a maximum of 3 weeks to review all of the material.o	Electronic versions of all natural ambient sound analysis worko	Acoustic Conditions Report (Task 2)
The following Final products should be submitted to NPS for review within 15 days after receiving NPS comments. o	Electronic versions of all natural ambient sound analysis worko	Final Acoustic Conditions Report (Task 2)
For Tasks 3-4: o	The Modeling Report shall be delivered to NPS within 30 days of receiving a thorough description of the alternatives to be analyzed (anticipated release of finalized alternatives for the Draft EIS is summer 2010) (Task 3).  NPS will review for 20 days.  A Final Modeling Report is due within 15 days of receiving NPS comments.o	The report for the descriptions to be included in the EIS (Task 4, "EIS Report") shall be delivered within 20 days of finalizing the Modeling Report.  NPS will review this report for 20 days. An EIS report shall be delivered within 15 days of receiving NPS comment.
All deliverables shall be submitted electronically.

<DESC><p>The Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program requires the capability to accurately measure these atmospheric properties. Current efforts are limited by ambiguous detection of optically thin clouds at either low or high altitude (particularly in the day time), and by insufficient knowledge of the vertical distribution of both cloud and aerosol optical properties, especially optical extinction. Ceilometers and micropulse lidar systems operated by the ARM Climate Research Facility (ACRF) lack sufficient sensitivity and accuracy to address these limitations. To address these measurement deficiencies ACRF is purchasing a complement of High Spectral Resolution LIDAR (HSRL) and Raman LIDAR systems. ACRF desires to purchase two (2) HSRL systems for cloud and aerosol studies, one for deployment at the North Slope of Alaska site, and the other as part of the ARM Mobile Facility instrument suite.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) 0 Are, 0 are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) 0 Are, 0 are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

	NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard 
Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3692.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this Agency. QUOTES ARE DUE BY 4:00 PM EST on July 23, 2009. Due to possible fax transmission problems vendors should e-mail their quotes to jean-claude.amisial@uscg.mil.

Anticipated Award date: August 5, 2009

THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT!!

52.219-7  Notice of Partial Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003) 

(a) Definitions. “Small business concern,” as used in this clause, means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the size standards in this solicitation. 
(b) General. 
(1) A portion of this requirement, identified elsewhere in this solicitation, has been set aside for award to one or more small business concerns. 
(2) Offers on the non-set-aside portion will be evaluated first and award will be made on that portion in accordance with the provisions of this solicitation. 
(3) The set-aside portion will be awarded at the highest unit price(s) in the contract(s) for the non-set-aside portion, adjusted to reflect transportation and other costs appropriate for the selected contractor(s). 
(4) The contractor(s) for the set-aside portion will be selected from among the small business concerns that submitted responsive offers on the non-set-aside portion. Negotiations will be conducted with the concern that submitted the lowest responsive offer on the non-set-aside portion. If the negotiations are not successful or if only part of the set-aside portion is awarded to that concern, negotiations will be conducted with the concern that submitted the second-lowest responsive offer on the non-set-aside portion.

(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability.

The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer. 
(c) Evaluation of offers. 
(1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American Act, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9. 
(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception, the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on unreasonable cost. 
(d) Alternate offers. 
(1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material. 
(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442 for the alternate offer, and a separate price comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies. 
(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested— 
(i) Will be rejected as non-responsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or 
(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.

<DESC><p>Q &amp; A</p>
<p>Q. It is not clear whether the items listed for the three separate AFB's are to be shipped as one-order, one-shipment for these three locations, or will the items be ordered and shipped as needed. In other words, will the entire quantity listed for each product, for each location, be shipped at the same time?</p>
<p>A. How the items are shipped (entire quantites, partial quantites, or which AFB gets the quantities first) does not particularly matter in this case. The&nbsp;main requirement for delivery is that the required quantites arrive at their designated AFBs by the indicated delivery date.<br /><br />For example:<br />-item 0001, a total quantity of 15 to be delivered to Tinker AFB by 30 Sep 2009<br />-item 0006, a total quantity of 11 to be delivered to Hill AFB by 30 Sep 2009.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is herey isisued to respond back to questions asked.

1) What dates will you need the meeting space and suites? 

The program will run as follows: 12/6 - set up; 12/7-11 - testing; 12/12 - tear down/check-out
 

2) Will guest be checking in Sunday, December 6th? Will they check out December 12th or 13th? 

For both the hotel suites that we will use as testing suites  and well as the sleeping rooms for the assessors, rooms will be needed for check-in/set up at normal check in time on Sunday 12/6 and will be vacated by check-out time on 12/12 (6 nights)

3) Are there any specific requirements for the lunches? 

For the lunches, the candidates (approximately 20 a day)  can be served the same meal each day (typically a box lunch consisting of a sandwich, chips, fruit and drink).   The assessors (approximately 22 each day) will be there the entire week, so there needs to variety in their meals.

4) How would you like the conference rooms and office set? 

Room set-up as follows:

	2 conference rooms -
set up classroom style for 10 people in each room, with a table and chair at the front of each room for administrators;  these rooms are secure rooms between the hours of 7:00 am and 6:00 pm. They may be cleaned after 6:00 pm; because these rooms are secure rooms, it would be preferable if we could be provided a key. We will need to lock the rooms frequently and run the assessment center on a very strict time schedule, so we cannot rely on hotel staff to respond to our calls to lock and unlock the rooms.  The rooms also contain a number of laptop computers, which must be secured 

	Office-
Furnished with a boardroom style table and appx 4 chairs;  additional tables should be added to this room; additional trash cans should also be added; telephone for in-house, local and credit card calls; VCR and Monitor for the entire period; this is a secure room and should not be entered by hotel staff at any time unless our staff is present.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-00A15, provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-34 are incorporated into this RFQ.  This procurement is a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned companies.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811212. The small business size standard is $25.0 million.

The IRS is seeking competitive quotes for the following brand name requirement, “EMC Hardware and Software Maintenance."  The rationale supporting this brand name requirement is that the storage standard for all IRS Tier 2 applications and databases is EMC Direct Access Systems Disk (DASD).  If there is a problem with the DASD or if software is not covered under maintenance, Production/Modernization could experience an extended shut-down until the required maintenance is purchased.

This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and brand name justification to procure EMC Hardware and Software Maintenance.  The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand names but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent.  All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature to the following email address: Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-34 are applicable to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors – Commercial Items, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.

All responsible sources that can provide the above requirements shall submit written quotations no later than 3:00pm EST on July 16, 2009. The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.  All quotes must include price(s); Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted. All questions must be submitted by 3:00pm EST on July 15, 2009 by email to Michael.A.Crawford@irs.gov.

To be considered responsive and technically acceptable, vendors must submit proposals that are structured in accordance with the instructions set forth in this solicitation and fully address the entire requirement.  You will be considered non-responsive and technically unacceptable if your quote does not fully address the entire requirement.  This will also render your pricing unacceptable.  Quotes shall include price information, quote expiration date, DUNS, Cage Code, tax ID and terms and conditions.

<p>Answer 8: The contract end date on the SF 1449, page 3, is 09/15/2014 not 09/15/2015.&nbsp; Therefore, the contract end date is 9/15/2014.</p>

<p>Question 14: Section 13, Key Personnel - Subparagraph (b) states that for the first twelve months of contract performance, no personnel substitutions will be made unless necessitated by sudden illness, death or termination of employment. While recognizing this language is in the Key Personnel clause, does the twelve month requirement apply only to the Key Personnel or to all personnel assigned to the contract?</p>
<p>Answer 14: This language applies to "all personnel assigned to the contract".</p>
<p>Question 15: The SOW, section 4 states that the travel budget should not exceed $5,000 for trips "usually" to St Louis.

<p>Question 17: Will the government consider having a site visit for this acquisition so that potential offerors can view the work site?</p>
<p>Answer 17: The Government does not anticipate any site visits.</p>
<p>Question 18: On page 14 of 75, paragraph (3) states that resumes of Key Personnel and all interpreter staff to be utilized will be submitted, can the government explain what the role of the interpreter will be on this project?

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to share questions and answer from vendors to the NIST End-User regarding the De-Ionized (DI) Water System SB1341-09-RQ-0343. 

1.Does this RFQ require Installation / Start-up?

As stated in the Line items, Installation and other services rendered must be included in the quotation.

2.Our System is pre-wired and requires and would require a single-point 460 VAC, 3-Phase, 60 Hz. power connection.  A transformer will supply all 120 VAC, 1-Phase, 60 Hz. control circuit power. Is adequate Power existing?

For ease of the Plant Division, we would like to limit the Voltage requirements between 120 VAC and 240 VAC at 60 Hz

3. Our quote will refer: DI vessel exchange service to be provided by others. System includes two(2)DI exchange bottles with initial charges of new mixed-bed ion exchange resin. Is the DI exchange service going to be bid as a separate part of the project? My prediction is that changes would occur 3 - 4 times / year.

The quotation should include at least 1 year worth of the service. The service cost for 1 year of service should be clearly stated in the quotation, so that we may estimate the cost of service over the lifetime of the system

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received from potential offerors as  follows:  

QUESTIONS: Q
ANSWERS: A

Q1.  Will UPS/FedEx/commercial courier agents be permitted to pass through building security and make deliveries anywhere internally within the NRC headquarters complex?  
A1.  No; NRC facilities are controlled-accessed.

Q2.  Will UPS/FedEx/commercial courier be required to deliver only to the mail room?
A2.  Yes; the NRC mail room is the designated point of delivery

Q3.  If a UPS/FedEx/other commercial courier is used for delivering material, what provision is there for reimbursement to the contractor for waiting time incurred by driver/delivery person due to building security delays, absence of receiving personnel, etc.?
A3.  There is no provision to pay for the time it takes for delivery.  

Q4.  Will the delivery person have to go through building security each day and then wait for an escort up to the specified internal delivery point in order to complete timely delivery by 8:30am?
A4.  No; delivery to the NRC mail room is sufficient.  The 8:30 delivery will only be required for daily delivery.  All other delivery times will be 10:30.

Q5.  Will NRC have someone waiting in the lobby at 8:30am to accept packages or will the delivery person have to pass through building security in order to complete deliveries?
A5.  See A4.

Q6.  Will NRC require hand delivery by the contractor or by a commercial courier or other “hand delivery” means?
A6.  No; hand delivery can be delivery by a contractor employee, or someone such as a commercial courier that the contractor uses to make the delivery.

Q7.  Will delivery to the mailroom by 8:30am constitute compliance with timely delivery?
A7.  Yes. See A4.

Q8. Given the nature of the level of security at NRC headquarters, is it customary for the reporter to be escorted at all times within any building?
A8.  Yes.

Q9.  When reporters arrive at NRC headquarters complex (and other NRC facilities), how much time should be allowed for passing through building security and being escorted to the appropriate meeting room?
A9.  Approximately 15 – 30 minutes.

Q10.  Since NRC has indicated its intent herewith to post electronic versions of transcribed proceedings on its website for free public access, will participants and other interested persons not have to pay the contractor for official transcripts?
A10.  They won’t have to, but if they want to buy one, they certainly can.  In some cases the participants may still want to purchase transcripts directly from the contractor for expedience. 

Q11.  On the pricing schedule, provision is made for transcription of video/cassettes/CDs; are sales permitted to the public or other third parties for this category of services?
A11.  As long as they are marked “authorized for sale” on the NRC work order request.

Q12.  Are there any prohibitions on sales to parties for work performed under the unclassified category of work?  If so, please specify.
A12.  See A11.

Q13.  Will NRC provide at no cost to the contractor all software and IT operating programs required to be utilized for encryption/un-encryption of audio and text files or are these expenses to be incurred by the contractor?
A13.  Offerors should propose all costs that it deems are necessary in meeting the requirements of this solicitation. 

Q14.  When encryption/un-encryption is required for electronic transfer of audio and text files between NRC user offices and the contractor, what provision is made for compensation for staff/personnel training and operating time, software ownership/updates, etc. and other contractor incurred expenses both at current volume of services performed and at expected future expanded volumes of required services?
A14.  See A.13.
   
Q.15  Will NRC provide at no cost to the contractor the software and training to comply with the time-coded ascii requirements as specified in this contract?
A15.  See A.13. 

Q16.  If not, what provision is made to compensate the contractor for personnel time spent in preparation and training for the unique and special aspects of time-coded ascii as required by NRC?
A16.  See A13.

Q17.  Further, is the contractor to be compensated in any way for ongoing costs associated with both present levels and future expected expanded levels of time-coded ascii transcripts?
A17.  See A13.  

Q18.  What provision is made for compensation to the contractor for new technologies adopted by NRC and required to be utilized by the contractor?
A18.  Within scope changes to the resultant contract would be handled pursuant with the Changes clause.

Q19.  On the pricing schedule, deliveries are indicated 10 day, 7 day, 3 day, etc., does this use of the word “day” refer to business days or calendar days?
A19.  Business days.

Q20.  Do any users of the contract have the authority to require or request any special binding materials for the transcript deliverables?
A20.  Yes, it will be as indicated on the work order request. (Specifically, there is an occasional request for spiral binding on a minuscript copy.)

Q21.  What provision is made for compensating the contractor for providing Spanish speaking court reporters and/or transcribers?
A21.  There is no extra compensation for this; it is a rare occurrence, happening on average twice per year.

Q22.  What locations, in addition to Puerto Rico, does NRC contemplate requiring Spanish speaking court reporters and/or transcribers?
A22.  The NRC does not anticipate the need in other locations although, we can not rule others out completely.

Q23.  Will the resulting official verbatim record be required to be transcribed in Spanish, Spanish and English, English only?
A23.  English only.

Q24.  Are the Spanish speaking court reporters/transcribers (Section 4.3) required to be bi-lingual in English as well?
A24.  It may not be necessary, as long as the final transcript is in English. 

Q25.  Will all official verbatim proceedings which involve a Spanish speaking court reporter require the record to be translated in to English, into Spanish or both?
A25.  Translated into English.

Q26.  What provision is made for additional compensation to the contractor for reporting and transcribing the extremely technical content of the numerous and frequent NRC proceedings in which the discussion is conducted in heavily accented English and spoken by people for whom English is not their primary language? 
A26.  No additional compensation.

Q27.  Has NRC, consistent with similar patterns elsewhere, adopted the practice of having witnesses submit direct testimony in writing for inclusion in to the official record of hearings, which is referred to as Pre-filed Testimony?
A27.  It may be writing or, some other format as on a CD, however it is submitted, it is to be included in the transcript when so directed.  Pre-filed testimony is submitted ahead of the hearing, but sometimes there are changes made to the actual testimony when it is accepted into the record on the day of the hearing(s).

Q28.  Does this result in shorter hearing duration “on-the-record”?
A28.  It could result in a shorter hearing duration.

Q29.  Despite having shorter “on-the-record” proceedings is the contractor required to include these witnesses’ pre-filed testimony in the official transcript instead of being paid for the pages of verbatim court reporting to capture this testimony?
A.29.  If it is “read” into the record, it has the normal compensation.  If it is added to the record “after the fact” in paper or, some other form, and copies are made, the copies are paid at the page rate as designated (in the contract) for copies.

Q30.  Will additional time be allowed to the contractor for delivery of transcripts of proceedings (or portions thereof) that occur during non-regular hours?
A30.  If a proceeding lasts past 6:00 pm local time, an additional day will be allowed for the delivery of the portion that occurs after 6:00 pm.  An exception would be in the case of an onsite hearing, etc., requiring next day delivery.

Q31.  Will the NRC reimburse the contractor for travel expenses for the frequently remote locations requiring a court reporter?
A31.    See A13.

Q32.  How long does it take, from the time of application, for the NRC Security Office to issue clearances required for classified proceedings?
A32.  Building access/safeguards – approximately 4 weeks.

L and Q  6 weeks if all goes smoothly and no follow-up questions or additional information is required.  Usually, that is not the case, and it takes longer.  If Security asks questions, it is incumbent upon the contractor to reply promptly so that the process proceeds as quickly as possible.

Q33.  How will NRC handle classified assignments while waiting for the security office to process contractor personnel?
A33.  That is an internal NRC issue.  The contractor is responsible for submitting applications promptly, as well as following up if there are questions.  See A32.

Q34.  Are these copies for Internal NRC use or are they distributed to other government agencies or to third parties?
A34.  The copies that are indicated on the work order request are for internal NRC use and are not distributed to other parties of the meetings/proceedings.  However, we do reserve the right to post transcripts on the NRC website where third parties could download them.

Q35.  We do not see where Form 187 is attached to Solicitation No. RS-ASL-09-312.  Could you please point me in the right direction for this?
A35.  See attachment to this amendment.

Q36.  Section 4.3 indicates that “the contractor shall provide a Spanish speaking reporter/transcriber when necessary in place such as Puerto Rico.”  If a Spanish speaking reporter/transcriber is required, will the proceedings be conducted entirely in Spanish or will an interpreter be present?  In the past 12 months, how many times has there been a request for a Spanish speaking reporter?
A36.  There may or may not be an interpreter present  usually, there is not.  The interview (it is not a proceeding as such; it is an investigator asking questions of someone who replies in Spanish) is not conducted entirely in Spanish.  There have only been one or two times in the past year that Spanish speaking has been requested.

Q37.  What percentage of the work will be classified?
A37.  That is an unknown, but in the past it has not exceeded 2%.

Q.38.  What percentage of classified proceedings is expected to be held outside of the DC area?  When a classified proceeding takes place outside of DC, will the reporter need to have a notary public license for the state in which the proceeding takes place?
A38.  A very small percent, if any.  There has been no classified work outside of DC in the past 8 years.  This may change with the High Level Waste Proceeding which will be  held in part, in Las Vegas.  The plan is, if there are any classified portions to try and hold them in DC.  The only classified we have had in the past year, were pre-recorded (by NRC employees) CD's or tapes that were mailed directly to the reporting company for transcription.  Yes, sometimes notaries are required.

Q39.  If a reporter is required to travel for classified work, will the NRC pay for the cost of travel?
A39.  See A13

Q40.  Will the NRC consider price/cost schedules in a format other than the one provided? 
A40.  See A13

Q41  Could you please clarify what is meant by “multiple, simultaneous reporting” as referenced in Section 1.0 of the Statement of Work?
A41.  This means there could be meetings, hearings etc. being conducted on the same day(s) in different locations or, at the same time at the same location.  For example, different offices at Headquarters, in Rockville could be holding meetings at the same time on the same day thus, requiring more than one reporter.

	(2) 0  Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

		(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
			(A) The tax liability is finally determined.  The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.  A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.  In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
			(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.  A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.  A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
		(ii) Examples.  (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
			(B)  The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.  In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
			(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159.  The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
			(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>TITLE: Automated COMINT Collection and Processing</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 08-02-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 30 Mar 2008; FY 09 by 30 Mar 2009, and FY10 by 30 Mar 2010. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Apr 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the lab's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required to support of automated COMINT collection and processing. Solutions to basic research and engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought. The overall technical objectives of the BAA are to develop techniques and algorithms for the detection, recognition, exploitation, and location of analog and digital communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. We are interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation; (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved digital signal processing hardware and software. The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Signal detection; (2) Signal recognition and classification in low Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) environments; (3) Improved methods to accomplish geolocation; (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD) algorithms; (5) Interference cancellation; (6) Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) / Frequency Difference Of Arrival (FDOA) techniques; (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices; (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked); and (9) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms. Detailed scope and definition of problems follow here: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, geolocation in moderate to low SINR environments: Current SIGINT platforms are inundated with multiple signals of interest across the spectrum, but are not able to process all of the high priority signals for a host of reasons including dense signal environments, low power signals, low SINR, power control, etc. (2) Any technologies that will enable current systems greater ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and locate signals would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation: Technology to further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is another area of research covered by this BAA. Particular attention will be paid to technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters beneath interference. (4) Multi-User Detection: Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired. Specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms are also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamformed, digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antenna are desired. (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques for improved geolocation for moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable is desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: We are interested in developing the above capabilities for existing and emerging military and commercial radio communications. (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked): We are interested in techniques for second, third and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (9) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms. Attention to DSP requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; as well as the qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives. (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>

<DESC><p>Based on information received during the sources sought phase this will be conducted as a full and open (non set-aside) competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;This is a presolicitation notice for the following statement of work:</p>
<p>This will be a firm fixed price contract for tree surveying services in Islip, New York.</p>
<p>There are approximately 68,000 trees to be inspected. These inspections must be completed within one year from date of contract award. There are enough Government personnel to accompany up to two teams of seven (8) workers each (sixteen (16) total). This number excludes the Foreman. Approximately 70% of these trees are on properties with many trees grouped closely together. We refer to these groups of trees as "stands". These stand properties are in both the Level 1 Quarantine area and the Level 2 Quarantine area. The list of properties with stands will be provided by Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) personnel. On these type of properties, the contract climbers will be responsible for inspecting all host trees - climbing all climbable host trees and visually inspecting the remaining non-climbable trees with binoculars, when appropriate. The contract climbers will be responsible for recording these inspections on the survey forms provided by ALB staff. The contract climbers will provide the survey forms capturing individual tree records as well as a summary of trees by Genus to ALB staff at the end of each working day. ALB staff will establish a presence during the inspections of these properties, as deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>The remaining 30% of the trees are scattered throughout residential areas, on private properties in the Level 2 Quarantine area. On these types of properties, the contract climbers will typically be responsible for inspecting only the climbable trees. ALB personnel will accompany the contract climbers to these properties and inspect the non-climbable trees. In the rare event that ALB program staff cannot accompany the contractor (e.g., unanticipated emergency with no replacement personnel) it may be necessary for the contract climbers to inspect all trees on a residential property and collect all pertinent data.</p>
<p>In general, work shall proceed on a block-by-block basis, working in teams led by ALB Program tree climbers and inspectors inspecting ALB host species for evidence of infestation. The survey (inspection of trees) shall include trees located along streets, boulevards, backyards, parklands, railroads, industrial parks, cemeteries, etc. The majority of the climbing survey shall include trees in dense, heavily wooded lots and properties. The bucket truck inspections shall include trees deemed by the ALB staff or contractor staff with the concurrence of ALB climbers, inspectors to be unsafe to climb due to various reasons such as power lines and poor tree health. The contractor shall inspect all host trees in the designated areas searching for ALB damage and active infestations.</p>

<p>Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals in the area of short-range wide-field-of-view extremely-agile electronically-steered photonic emitters (SWEEPER).  The overall goal is to create a paradigm shift in active optical beam steering and sensing by developing chip-scale integrated photonic coherent beam-forming technologies that overcome the limits of opto- mechanical and electro optical systems while being constrained to small size, weight, and power (SWaP).  DARPA envisions that a successful SWEEPER program will establish photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology that will provide video frame rate beam steering speeds, and emit multiple beams with a total output power of 10 W.   All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred (darpa-baa-09-66@darpa.mil).  See attached Full DARPA-BAA-09-66 document.

The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to establish an effort to cost share, on a 1:1 minimum basis, development of continuous lower energy, emissions and noise (CLEEN) technologies for civil subsonic jet airplanes to help achieve the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals to increase airspace system capacity by reducing significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit or reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions impacts on the global climate.  The CLEEN program is focused on reducing current levels of aircraft noise, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use, and advancing alternative fuels for aviation use.  The focus of this effort is to: (1) mature previously conceived noise, emissions and fuel burn reduction technologies from Technology Readiness Levels  (TRLs) of 3-4 to TRLs of 6-7 to enable industry to expedite introduction of these technologies into current and future aircraft and engines, and (2) assess the benefits and advance the development and introduction of alternative "drop in" fuels for aviation, with particular focus on renewable options, including blends.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR BID – PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

THIS NOTICE IS BEING ISSUED TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT  INTEREST FROM QUALIFIED TOTAL HUBZONE OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES TO SET THIS PROJECT ASIDE. (Details Below).  

Prime Contractors who are HUBZone small businesses or Service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by e-mail to CFLContracts@fhwa.dot.gov or by telefax to 720-963-3360 (Attn:  Brenda McGehee) for receipt by close of business (3 p.m. local Denver time) on July 16, 2009.  A decision on how to advertise this project will be made on or after
July 23, 2009.  

(1) A positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor; 

(2) A copy of the letter from SBA stating date of HUBZone small business certification.  In the case of a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concern, you must provide proof of eligibility (DD form 214 or a letter of adjudication from the Veterans Administration).  This information must be provided in order to determine eligibility – DO NOT SEND COPIES OF YOUR CCR PROFILE; 

(3) letter from bonding agent stating your firm’s capability to bond for a single project of $2 million, and your firm’s aggregate bonding capacity; and

(4) Provide a list of road construction projects involving asphalt pavement, construction of concrete box culverts, and construction prefabricated single span steel bridge. DO NOT SEND INFORMATION ON PROJECTS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE THE ABOVE WORK.
 
The size of a small business firm includes all parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, etc.  Refer to the Code of Federal Regulations 13 CFR 121.103 for information on how the SBA determines affiliation and 13 CFR 121.108 regarding the penalties for misrepresentation of size status.  All firms should be certified in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) located at https://orca.bpn.gov/

A Qualified HUBZone SBC receiving a HUBZone contract for general construction must spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its own employees or employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.  This requirement may be met by expending at least 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel on its employees or it may subcontract at least 35% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel to one or more qualified HUBZone SBCs.  A qualified HUBZone SBC prime contractor may not, however, subcontract more than 50% of the cost of the contract incurred for personnel to non-qualified HUBZone SBCs.

The project is located within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, which is adjacent to the City of Lawton, Oklahoma and the Fort Sill Army Base.  

This project consists of the placement of fills on both sides of an existing 2-mile asphalt paved road (Six Mile Scenic Road) to provide additional width, and the construction of paved shoulders along both sides of the road.  A double 10-foot by 5-foot concrete box culvert will be extended in place to match the new widths, along with the construction of new headwalls and wingwalls.  Other circular metal culverts along the route will need to be extended.  In order to perform the widening, both edges of the existing pavment must be saw cut along most of the length.  Also included in the project are the replacement of guardrails and guardrail end terminals, grouted riprap at the culvert extensions, and the replacement of permanent signs.  After the widening and paved shoulders are completed, the entire roadway surface will be treated with a 3/8-inch modified slurry seal.

In addition to the road work described above, a prefabricated single span steel pedestrian bridge, 140-feet in length, will be constructed at the Elk Mountain Campground area of the Refuge.  Other work associated with the bridge construction includes the removal of an existing small pedestrian bridge in the same area, the placement of loose Class 5 riprap at the new bridge abutments, and the use of concrete formliner, which will be painted, on the bridge abutments.  The deck of the new bridge will be poured and finished concrete.

Construction can be performed year-round.  The project is anticipated to begin in late summer 2009, and should take six months to complete.  The estimated price is between $1 and $2 million.

<p>________________________________</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce's (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued this Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Ground Segment Antenna System to support the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites R series (GOES-R) Program. This DRAFT RFP is not a solicitation, but is published as a planning instrument and as a means of soliciting industry comments for use in developing the final RFP which will be released at a future date.</p>
<p>NOAA's primary environmental mission is to provide weather forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean area, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) allow for constant observations of the Earth's environment from geostationary orbit. These observations provide data for environmental phenomena affecting ecosystems, climate forecasts, weather and water, and supporting the safe and efficient operation of the Nation's transportation and commerce systems for the National economy.</p>
<p><br />The NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) procurement of the next-generation series of GOES (GOES-R) will replace the current GOES I and N-series satellites. The GOES R-series satellites are required to sustain capabilities through 2027. Due to lifetime probability predictions for the current GOES I and N-series, a GOES-R launch is required in the 2015 timeframe to maintain mission data continuity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Ground Antenna System is being procured in a contract separate from the GOES-R Satellite and Ground Segment contracts. The Ground Antenna System includes the design, fabrication, and test of six (6) new antenna stations and the upgrade of four (4) antenna stations. The antenna stations will be installed at three different sites: Wallops, Virginia (three new antenna stations); Suitland, Maryland (four antenna station upgrades); and a Remote Backup site in the vicinity of Fairmont, West Virginia (three new antenna stations). The new antenna stations will require operability with the GOES-R satellites and be backward- compatible with the current GOES I and N-series satellites.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to acquire the Ground Segment Antenna System products and services through full and open competition conducted under FAR Part 15.&nbsp; The Government envisions the award of a single contract.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Government. A site tour of the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland is anticipated on or about June 22, 2009. A site tour of the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) is anticipated on or about July 9, 2009. The anticipated release date of the Final RFP is on or about August&nbsp;2009.&nbsp; The anticipated award date is April 2010.&nbsp;</p>

As such, the documents contain data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and dissemination to non-U.S. persons whether in the United States or abroad requires an export license or other authorization.  Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclose of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under the U.S. Department of State website, http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

To participate in this program, all firms must acknowledge their responsibility under the Arms Export Control Act.  A foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program.  Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.  

Prior to release of any control document, the contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide this certification and/or proof of a current approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT--THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER CONTRACT NO. SBAHQ04F0195.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


The Contractor shall perform the following tasks in regards to financial statement reestimate modeling:

IV&V reviews will be limited to validating any corrections made in response to audit findings or questions, validating that SBA has not made any other changes and a model run to validate the cash flows and subsidy rates that result from updating actual performance data through June 30.

- High-level review of all Excel tools and interfaces with the CSC2.  The review and findings must be included in the final report for each model/program as this review objective was recommended by KPMG during the 2007 financial statement audit. 

  - Part of the IV&V review must be a validation that the correct loan level cash flows are linked or are being properly fed to the cash flows read by the CSC2.  The OCFO’s Accounting Liaison and Quality Assurance Branch validated the intra-governmental (lower) portion of the cash flows through the end of fiscal year 2008 prior to the models being sent out for an IV&V review. 

 - Validations that the cash flows generated during the E&Y model run match those provided by SBA or a comparison of the subsidy rates from the “Summary” tab of the CSC2. 

 - Validation that all model changes have been adequately documented. 

 - Validation of the formulas, SAS code, and methodology used for all changes. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.

<DESC>INFORMATIONAL QUOTES
TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY
FOR A FORMAL ACQUISITION

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) 
Washington National Records Center

This is a request for informational quotes by the General Services Administration to determine the suitability for a formal acquisition of a lease net of electric, sewer, and water for warehouse and office space.  The Federal Government has a requirement to lease 230,000 BOMA rentable square feet for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) of the Mid-Atlantic region.  The proposed building must yield approximately 20,000 BOMA useable square feet of office and administrative space and 210,000 BOMA useable square feet of contiguous warehouse space.  The site shall be able to accommodate 60 on-site parking spaces available for visitors, handicap and employees.  The lease shall have an initial term of up to ten (10) years with an option to renew the lease for an additional five (5) years.

The delineated area of consideration is as follows:

North - Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) to the outer loop of the Baltimore Beltway, I-695
West - Maryland/Virginia Route 15 to Virginia Route 20 (Constitution Highway)
South - Virginia Route 20 to Route 3 until Fredericksburg (including all of Stafford County, Virginia)
East - from Stafford County, Virginia along the western shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay to Ft. Howard, Maryland including the outer loop of I-695 around to Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road)

GSA is interested in sites for new construction or existing facilities that meet the following minimum requirements.  The proposed location must be currently zoned for the intended use and the development must be planned and approved by the local jurisdiction.  The site cannot be located within a floodplain or a wetland.  GSA may request site studies regarding wildlife, storm water management, soil conditions, deforestation plans, and/or traffic studies.  Building infrastructure (water, sewer, utilities) to the proposed site must be in place or readily available, and the site must have paved access to major highways.  The proposed building requires a 100 foot setback from parking areas and roads. The proposed site to accommodate the facility could range from 12 to 17 acres and must be secured by a fence.  

The proposed facility must comply with fire safety, security, and other records protection requirements as stated in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart K, available at:
http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/part-1228/k.html

WAREHOUSE/RECORDS SPACE - The warehouse facility shall consist of five (5) records storage bays (approximately 210,000 usable square feet) consisting of two (2) temporary records bays at 42,000 square feet each, and three  (3) permanent records storage bays at 42,000 square feet each.  ALL storage bays must meet the Federal records storage requirements outlined in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart K.  In addition, the permanent bays will require office-type air conditioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  
  
Offerors are specifically placed on notice that requirements for some building elements exceed the normal "warehouse" standards.  The Office of Regional Records Services, the Space and Security Division, and the Office of Preservation Programs of the National Archives and Records Administration will provide technical assistance and oversight in identifying specific design features, and particularly those which must be built into the permanent records storage areas during construction.

The record storage space should have a minimum of fifteen feet, one inch clear stacking height above finished floor.  The space must be contiguous and the major segments individually must be fully occupiable on a priority and phased basis from start of build out/construction over an estimated one-year to one and one-half year period.  All office, records storage, and records handling equipment, such as furniture, ladders, carts, pallets, and forklifts are to be furnished by the Government at no cost to the Offeror.  The Offeror shall provide the shelving.

OFFICE/ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE - The office facility shall be a Class A space.  It is to be functionally located in relation to the records storage bays for efficient operations.  All offices and rooms located along the exterior walls shall have windows unless otherwise specified in this document. It shall be fully sprinklered (light hazard).  The finished ceiling shall be at least 9 feet, but not more than 11 feet AFF.  Lighting in the office areas shall be recessed.  The finished room sizes are minimum “wall-to-wall” net usable requirements, exclusive of any building common factors or circulation factors.  The Government will allow for a dimensional variance of +/- 6” or a room size variance of 2%.  Enclosed rooms located adjacent to the records storage bays must have 2-hour fire rated walls for the single wall that is adjacent to the bay.  Processing rooms, work areas including conference rooms, research room and lobby shall have office-level HVAC with multiple zones and units based on room function.  All internal circulation paths must be a minimum of 60 inches wide.

Employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation shall be available within a 10.0 mile radius of the facility.  

Space must meet the Federal Government’s standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside any floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy by the summer of 2012 or sooner.  Phased occupancy is required.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.  For existing buildings, written expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, current site zoning and contact information for owner or authorized agent. 

A written statement of interest should be submitted by 4:30 PM EST, July 31, 2009, and should include the following:

1. Building name and address;

The Grantee (Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Buenaventura) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to evaluate existing conditions at the Port of Buenaventura; review current procedures and equipment at the port; determine and recommend improvements; prepare technical background material, and address the implementation of a container scanning facility. The objective of the Port of Buenaventura Operational and Security Enhancement feasibility study in Colombia is to improve the monitoring and security of cargo transit at the Port of Buenaventura, the main terminal on Colombia&rsquo;s Pacific coast. The selected feasibility study contractor will evaluate existing conditions at the Port of Buenaventura; review current procedures and equipment at the port; determine and recommend improvements; prepare technical background material, and address the implementation of a container scanning facility. Implementation measures would include the installation of advanced security technologies such as a Vessel Traffic System (VTS) to monitor the safe transit of vessels near Buenaventura&rsquo;s coastline; Optical Character Recognition (OCR) equipment to record truck designations and container markings within the port; integration of container scanning equipment, and radiation detection and computerized integration of the existing closed circuit television network. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks: 1) Data collection and review of existing conditions; 2) develop a vessel tracking system; 3) develop an optical character recognition system; 4) develop a computer monitoring system; 5) review of cargo inspection; 6) interim presentation; 7) development and environmental impacts; and 8) final report and presentation. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm&rsquo;s name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFP's received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA. Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP. Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM (local time in Buenaventura, Colombia), July 21, 2009, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY -<br />Synopsis:<br />Contract DE-AC24-05OH20192 is a Cost plus incentive fee Small Business Set-Aside contract awarded to LATA/Parallax Portsmouth. The contract has been modified to allow for performance of all preliminary planning activities in support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. LATA Parallax Portsmouth shall perform all planning activities necessary for the demolition and disposition of all materials for various buildings at the Portsmouth site. ARRA funding in the amount of $4,600,000 is added to the contract. The period of performance is 90 days from the issuance date of the modification.<br />Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:<br />Use of fixed price contracting is not feasible because the risk involved in environmental remediation work is high and cannot be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. Performance uncertainties cannot be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impacts cannot be made.<br />The work contracted for under the 90-day planning modification falls within the definition of remediation and has been determined to be within the scope of the contract. Additionally, Paragraph C.2.0.0, of the contract, Contract Purpose and Scope, states:<br />There may be additional Portsmouth remediation work identified during performance of this contract which may be considered to be within the scope of this contract as determined by the Contracting Officer. Impact of changes directed by the Contracting Officer will be evaluated for impact to the Target Cost of this contract pursuant to the "Changes" clause.<br />Vendor DUNS: 175892327</p>
