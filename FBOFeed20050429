Consequently, WHSCL will also be the document delivery services provider through a contractual teaming agreement to be implemented by the MEO; therefore this proposed contract will be a bridge to the MEO by providing document delivery services during the MEO phase-in period.  Based on the above it is in the Government's best interest to award a contract to WHSCL for the interim period document delivery contract.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement a program described below.  Under a new Strategic Objective Agreement (SOAG) being negotiated between USAID/Bolivia and the Government of Bolivia, USAID will support a triad of partners to strengthen capacity of the decentralized public sector health care system to provide clinical and community-based services in 131 municipalities.  The three partners include the Ministry of Health (through the PROSIN Project), and institutional contractor to strengthen clinical services, and PROCOSI, a Bolivian NGO Network, to provide community-based health.  

In order to ensure that PROCOSI develops the in-house capacities to fully participate within the triad of partners, USAID seeks to put in place a technical assistance contract with the following objectives: 

Objective One: Strengthen the technical capacity of PROCOSI and its members to deliver a standardized package of community-based health interventions:

-	Strengthened technical capacity within PROCOSI to design and implement quality community-based health activities based on best practices, national and international standards
-	Development and implementation of an institutionalized approach for (a) continuous quality improvement (CQI) and (b) program monitoring and evaluation within the PROCOSI network

Objective Two: Strengthen management capacity within the PROCOSI network to improve health program administration and institutional sustainability:

Development and implementation of an institutionalized approach for assessing and strengthening health program management capacity among NGO members of the PROCOSI network

VISION OF SUCCESS - The Mission holds firmly to the principle that local capacity-building is a key development goal and helps promote national ownership and long-term sustainability.  The technical assistance role of the contractor in assisting PROCOSI is viewed as limited and transitional until such time as local capacity is adequate to meet development program needs.  Promoting the transfer and institutionalization of capacity-building and technical assistance skills within PROCOSI will be the measure of success for the contractor’s performance.

RELATIONSHIP WITH PROCOSI – Although the contractor will ultimately be responsible to the USAID Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and Regional Contracting Officer for technical and administrative performance, the short and long-term technical advisers will be located within the PROCOSI central offices in La Paz.  They will serve under the general oversight of PROCOSI’s NGO Umbrella Project Director and will function as integrated team members in support of the technical staff responsible for implementing the Cooperative Agreement.  The contractor’s activity will not be publicly identified as a separate project.

It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), completion type contract will be awarded for implementation of the two priority components specified above.  Implementation will occur over a 3 year period.  USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified Offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  The Mission anticipates issuing the RFP o/a April 29, 2005.  Proposal due date will be May 31, 2005.

These fuels and products, and the precursors  required for their production, include diesel, jet fuel, and carbons such  as pitches or cokes.  In addition, technologies related to the economical  production and separation of hydrogen will be required to facilitate the  use of coal for many of these fuels and products.  The fuels of the 21st  century will have to satisfy the competing demands of environmental  acceptance and engine performance.  To be acceptable to the marketplace,  engines must deliver the required acceleration, horsepower, reliability,  and conformance to specifications.  At the same time, cleaner burning  fuels will be required to minimize both airborne pollutants and emission  of carbon dioxide.  Increased emphasis on the control of particulate  matter is likely in light of the growing popularity and practicality of  diesel engines.  A similar set of concerns exists for jet fuels.  One type  of fuel currently under development and capable of providing such  qualities is a next-generation diesel fuel produced via a Fischer-Tropsch  (F-T) process.  Novel concepts furthering this and/or other approaches to  the development of premium fuels and products from coal are sought.

<DESC>The US Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) plans to procure sole source with Rome Navigation Solutions, Inc. to develop and evaluate software which can operate on outputs from an integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) based system, a stored “map” of the immediate track system, and ancillary data (such as accelerometer data), in order to determine if the train is operating on the assigned track.  The resulting algorithm must be extraordinarily reliable with respect to minimizing the probability of any incident on the tracks.  A desk-top “breadboard and laboratory” is sought under this procurement, in which a design can be tested using actual train performance data made availa ble.  Unique software has been developed that will analyze the data and utilize track change system component models as part of producing a design that ensures high system reliability.  The contractor shall collect and validate data, suitably modify the integrated GPS/Concept Validation Algorithm, generate test statistics and decision logic, create associated maps, test the algorithms operationally, optimize the code for safe operational use, and provide reports recommendations, and briefings.  This procurement will be conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The NAICS Code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4 Million.  Interested firms have 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis publication to submit in writing to the above  named point of contact, clear and convincing documentation of their company’s capability to provide required services.  Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority in FAR Part 6.302 as referenced above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses received to this notice would normally be considered, solely for the purpose of determining whether to reissue as a competitive procurement. The Request for Quote (RFQ) issuance will be on or about May 2 5, 2005.  Small business firms will be required to submit a maximum of three (3) but not less than two (2) pages of documentation in support of the above for evaluation prior to receiving a solicitation.

The Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is recompeting a five-year tissue collection contract.  The Contractor for this procurement will obtain (via informed consent) and characterize (histo-pathologically) normal-appearing and neoplastic bronchial, pulmonary, prostectomy, breast, esophageal, intestinal, colonic, pancreatic and hepatic tissues and cells, as well as other biological specimens (including pleural effusions, urine, and blood and its components) at the time of surgery for cancer or non-cancer conditions, and at immediate autopsy of non-cancer donors from organ transplant units, shock-trauma sources, or routine autopsy from medical examiner cases.  As well, the Contractor will prepare epidemiological profiles on all donors willing to provide personal information from current medical records and historical, social, occupational personal and family health information, to complete an NIH designed epidemiological questionnaire.  The incumbent Contractor is The University of Maryland at Baltimore (Contract No. N02-RC-17011), which is scheduled to expire on Aprial 30, 2005.  The LHC utilizes the human tissues and cells for in-vitro carcinogenesis, case-control, and case-series studies, which have previously and will in the future allow the LHC to contribute to the general advancement of in-vitro methods for investigating (a) molecular and genetic components of malignant human cells; (b) normal cell phenotypes modified by the transfection of genes or exposure to chemical carcinogens; (c) cellular phenotypes differentiating the mutagen sensitivity of cancer and non-cancer patients; and (d) detection and measure of cellular markers associated with the initiation and prognosis of cancer.  The NCI shall consider proposals from all responsible sources.  However, Offerors must demonstrate in their technical proposal, their ability to facilitate delivery of the non-frozen viable tissues to the NCI in Bethesda, Maryland, within two hours from the receipt of specimens from pathology and within four hours of receipt from surgery, as a mandatory qualification criteria of this solicitation.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure. 

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently U.S. licensed influenza vaccines for human usage are produced in embryonated hen’s eggs. Reliance on a single product as a substrate for influenza vaccine production has several vulnerabilities including a protracted vaccine production cycle, lethal toxicity to avian influenza viruses, and susceptibility to production drops caused by disease or nutrition. Therefore, diversification of vaccine manufacturing substrates, such as tissue culture cells and recombinant DNA expression systems may provide a more responsive and flexible influenza vaccine industry with increased overall production capacity and ability to provide ample vaccine supply rapidly in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop domestically manufactured cell- or recombinant DNA-based influenza vaccine leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities that the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing, clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using tissue culture cell or recombinant DNA expression system substrates. Funds may be used also for scale-up development and manufacturing facility design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or partnerships with companies having vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to provide U.S. pandemic influenza preparedness. Other eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of successful development and licensure of vaccines for human usage; (2) Vaccine program that includes influenza vaccine candidates for seasonal or pandemic influenza that have successfully completed safety and immunogenicity human clinical trials (Phase I); (3) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (4) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of October 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government.  An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 ìg of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage.  The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

	The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities.  The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>HPCMP Phase I Request for Quotes – DRAFT

Note: This is a DRAFT Request for Quotations (RFQ), and vendors are not expected to submit proposals at this time.  This Draft RFQ is issued in an effort to promote early exchange of information between the Government and industry.  This Draft RFQ will allow potential bidders to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and possibly enhance the Government’s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in bid preparation, evaluation, negotiation, and Delivery Order award.

This Draft RFQ does not bind the Government to issue a Final version of the RFQ, nor to award any Delivery Order(s) as a result.  This Draft RFQ is for planning purposes only, and should be used for such.

A Final RFQ Phase I is expected for release on or about 16-20 May 2005.

Draft Benchmark Instructions will be provided no later than Friday, May 6, 2005 via FedBizOps posting.

The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is seeking initial quotes for a uniform range of HPC configurations and associated maintenance against GSA Schedule 70 contracts to address the non-real time HPC requirements for its user base of scientists and engineers across the HPCMP High Performance Computing (HPC) Centers, including Major Shared Resource Centers (MSRCs), selected Allocated Distributed Centers (ADCs), and Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs) previously indentified as Dedicated Distributed Centers (DDCs).  Information obtained from the initial Phase I responses will be used in conjunction with benchmark performance data obtained from potential Offerors to determine solutions to address HPCMP user requirements. No awards will be made from the initial RFQ.  On or about 12 Sep 2005 a final RFQ (Phase II) for one or more specific HPCMP funded sites will be sought.   General information is provided below and in the attachments to give Offerors a better understanding of the terms and conditions which may be required for systems and services acquired. The following attachments generally reflect the Program’s expectations:  Terms and Conditions; Acceptance Testing; Warranty and Maintenance; and Acceptance Test Plan template.  These are draft documents that may be changed when Phase II of the RFQ is released.  The Government may make multiple awards using the Phase II RFQ; however, the Government also reserves the right not to make any award if deemed in its best interest. 

To view the full text of this Draft RFQ, see the following website address:  Go to www.hpcmo.hpc.mil.  Click on TI06 Information and Documents, click on GSA's Draft Phase I RFQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The proposed project consists of construction of an earthen dam embankment across Honey Creek, to create a seasonal and permanent ponding areas.  The lower portion of the dam will be used as open channel for the emergency spillway of the ponding area .  An existing abandoned county road will be reconstructed on the crest of the proposed dam embankment and open channel spillway.  The ponding area behind the dam will be controlled by stoplog structures, one placed at the bottom of the creek for cleaning and completely emptying the ponding area and the other at elevation 913 feet to control the seasonal ponding area.  The construction of the 973 long earthen dam will require 25,300 CY of compacted impervious fill from a borrow area located within the pondi ng area.  The side slopes of the dam will be protected by 24-inches quarry run rock.  A 10-foot wide berm will be place 8 feet below the top of the embankment.  A coarse aggregate toe drain will be constructed at the downstream toe of the embankment to col lect seepage and increase the stability of the landside slope during high water elevations. The estimated construction cost is between $250,000 and $500,000.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure. 

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently U.S. licensed influenza vaccines for human usage are produced in embryonated hen’s eggs. Reliance on a single product as a substrate for influenza vaccine production has several vulnerabilities including a protracted vaccine production cycle, lethal toxicity to avian influenza viruses, and susceptibility to production drops caused by disease or nutrition. Therefore, diversification of vaccine manufacturing substrates, such as tissue culture cells and recombinant DNA expression systems may provide a more responsive and flexible influenza vaccine industry with increased overall production capacity and ability to provide ample vaccine supply rapidly in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop domestically manufactured cell- or recombinant DNA-based influenza vaccine leading towards FDA-licensure and human usage. The scope of activities that the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing, clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using tissue culture cell or recombinant DNA expression system substrates. Funds may be used also for scale-up development and manufacturing facility design but not facility construction. 

Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers that have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. or partnerships with companies having vaccine manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to provide U.S. pandemic influenza preparedness. Other eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of successful development and licensure of vaccines for human usage; (2) Vaccine program that includes influenza vaccine candidates for seasonal or pandemic influenza that have successfully completed safety and immunogenicity human clinical trials (Phase I); (3) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (4) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate the final stage development leading towards FDA-licensure of new influenza vaccines in U.S. based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three to five years or 36 - 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-04, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of October 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government.  An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.

----------------------

This is a sources sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a procurement that will be initiated in the near future.  No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this sources sought notice.

The Engineering Metrology Group (EMG) in the Precision Engineering Division (PED) of the Manufacturing and Engineering Laboratory (MEL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland is the primary calibration laboratory for the United States.  As part of this effort, EMG has developed specialized software to implement its Measurement Assurance Program (MAP).  This software is an integrated set of programs that manages the complete calibration cycle, including customer information, data taking and analysis, report writing, statistical process control, and management of the master gauge system.  Currently there are versions for gauge blocks, thread wires, angle blocks and sphere diameter.  All of these will be merged into a single lab system.  There are also auxiliary programs to interface a number of instruments into this system as well as those of the M48 CMM and dilatometer.  

The current MAP system is in Hewlett Packard BASIC, and has been used and occasionally modified for over 20 years.  These changes need to be integrated into a single system, and to ensure future changes can be made and supported, EMG has decided to rewrite all of its systems in Visual Basic (VB.NET).  Because of some limitations in our instrument interfaces the software system National Instruments LabView software will be used for communicating to instruments.

In order to proceed to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy to accomplish the above, NIST seeks information on potential sources with experience and current expertise in some the following areas:

HP Basic
Visual Basic (VB.NET)
SQL
National Instruments LabView software
Statistical Process Control

IF YOUR COMPANY HAS RECENT (IN THE PAST THREE YEARS) EXPERIENCE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN SCOPE TO WHAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW MAP SYSTEM, THEN PLEASE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION BY EMAIL TO JOSEPH.WIDDUP@NIST.GOV NO LATER THAN MAY 6, 2005:

1.  Description of each similar project completed by your company as a prime Contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past three (3) years, including as much of the following information as possible:

 (a) dollar amount of the contract;

 (b) brief description of the technical requirements of that project;

 (c) contract type used on that project (e.g., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour, time-and-materials, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, etc.);

 (d) indication of how long the project took to complete from start to finish;

 (e) how many Contractor and, if applicable, subcontractor full time equivalents were required to complete the job; and

 (f) name, address, point of contact and phone number of customer organization for which the work was done.

2. Current socioeconomic status of your company as it relates to NAICS 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services (see NAICS table at http://www.sba.gov/size/sizetable2002.html); also, whether your company is currently certified as an 8(a) company or a service-disabled veteran-owned company.

3. Indication of whether your company currently has its own GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract and whether your company currently can provide IT developmental services under that contract (include the contract number for that contract);

4.  Indication of whether your company has its own Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) and whether your company can provide IT developmental services under that contract (include the contract number for that contract);

5. Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov.

Introduction:  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques to Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage and Assess (F2T2EA) stationary and moving surface targets.  Under the Targets-Under-Trees (TUT) program, the Information (IF) Directorate is partnered with three other AFRL Directorates, including the Sensors (SN) Directorate and Human Effectiveness (HE) Directorate at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) and the Munitions (MN) Directorate at Eglin AFB. The TUT program management team is led by AFRL/SNAA with deputy program managers from AFRL/IFEA and AFRL/SNRR and will be executed with coordinated procurements from four AFRL Directorates: SN, IF, MN, and HE. The principal solicitations are those from AFRL/SN, entitled "Targets Under Trees (TUT) Family of Systems and Supporting Technologies" and this solicitation from AFRL/IF.    The AFRL/SN solicitation is concerned with the overall TUT systems engineering, development for the Foliage-Penetrating (FOPEN) radar, its associated technologies and other support functions, including modeling and simulation. The weapon fuze technology development is being conducted through AFRL/MN, whereas, the human-system interface technology development and design is being conducted by AFRL/HE. This AFRL/IF solicitation is concerned with the fusion of intelligence data from multiple ISR sensors to find, fix and track mobile ground targets in the open and hide. This includes an extensible system architecture to accommodate intelligence data and advanced fusion algorithms, data base integration including geo-registration, and reasoning technologies to reduce target location errors and identification uncertainties.  The desired system will produce target quality location, identification and kinematics.  This AFRL/IF solicitation addresses Intelligence Fusion and its supporting technologies. The TUT program is chartered to develop a capability for performing the Find, Fix and Engage portions of the kill chain process on targets employing concealment with camouflage and foliage. The TUT concept is to find and identify concealed mobile ground vehicles using multi-sensor fusion and Very High Frequency (VHF) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) employing Change Detection techniques. The targets will be identified by associating the detections with fused intelligence information products and held at risk while in hide with upgraded foliage penetrating munitions. The TUT program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over the entire program. The developments required to meet the TUT objectives involve FOPEN radar with Change Detection, information fusion, geo-registration, terrain characterization, weapons fuze and human-system interface technologies.  In addition to direct technology developments, the TUT program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment.  Finally, an overall system engineering effort will assist the Government in managing the distribution of functionality and performance requirements across the contributing technologies.  The TUT program is sponsored by the Air Force Aerospace Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Center (AC2ISRC). Objective:  The level of complexity addressed by this PRDA varies from stationary and moving targets in open environments to targets that are partially to fully obscured by foliage and camouflage. However, the TUT Intelligence Fusion System (TUT IFS) focuses on the ability to locate and identify targets employing concealment with camouflage or foliage, while minimizing false alarms and the impact of terrain obscuration and platform outages.  The problem being addressed by this procurement is the development of an overall TUT IFS architecture and the interface and integration of specific contributing systems. The TUT IFS will fuse various types of intelligence information to produce actionable information including targetable locations and identification for mobile ground vehicles in hide. The developed system will be transitionable to the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and/or as applicable, the Combined Air Operations Center - Experimental (CAOC-X).  Technical Background:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Fusion Technology Branch is developing an open, distributed, object-oriented architecture for information fusion under their Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) program.  This program includes support for multiple interoperable fusion components and a public Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is suitable for inserting new fusion components into the system. Fusion component interoperability is based on a shared description of the battlespace and shared data exchange and persistence mechanisms. Through the implementation of a common interface and a common battlespace ontology, new and legacy fusion engines and capabilities can be encapsulated and become interoperable components within a common architecture. Given this stable environment for test and development, the performance of legacy and new fusion engines can be rapidly inserted, evaluated and consistently quantified.    PRDA Organization: The overall objective of this PRDA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies required for locating, tracking and identifying targets in both open and obscured environments. The original PRDA was presented in two sections.  The first section addressed proposal requests for the Intelligence Fusion System Integrator (IFSI) for the TUT IFS, and has been completed.  Therefore, the IFSI portion published in the synopsis on 26 Oct 2001 has been deleted from this reannouncement.  The second section, Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) Fusion for TCTs (MIFT), is still ongoing.  For this section, AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative solutions to the Find, Fix and Track portions of the TUT kill chain.  The IFSI contractor(s) are not precluded from submitting White Papers. It is expected that within the technical requirements for this PRDA, there will be additional technologies that need to be addressed.  As part of the AFRL Fusion program addressing MIFT, technologies will be addressed leading to a more robust fusion system.  These technologies will be considered for inclusion into the IFSI effort as the technologies are matured.  In order to provide funding for development of promising technologies, AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that address the following specific areas and must be implemented as an ASF component: (1) reasoning technologies that establish target attributes and ID; (2) optimization of Multi-INT fusion techniques; (3) identification of stationary and moving targets employing sensor cueing and cross-cueing; (4) robust techniques that provide adequate target identification for continuous tracking in open and obscured environments; (5) advanced fusion and reasoning techniques that reduce target location error and ID uncertainty; and (6) other data fusion technologies relevant to solving the TUT problem, such as; Video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, MASINT (seismic, acoustic, magnetic), HUMINT.

Awards: Multiple awards for the MIFT initiative are anticipated.  The principal funding of the White Papers and the anticipated awards as a result of this PRDA will start in 2Q FY02, and will be in the form of contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed.  Contractor teaming is encouraged. Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 32 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000, per award.  Total funding for the MIFT portion of this PRDA is approximately, $15.4M.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches.  Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software applications that utilize ASF Core Services and demonstrations with levels of maturity adequate to transition to the IFSI and be integrated into the TUT IFS architecture. Integration and demonstration utilizing the AFRL Fusion Laboratory at the Rome Research Site is required under this PRDA. Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) will be required with the IFSI, AFRL Fusion Laboratory in-house contractors and others, as required.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness. In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort. Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the White Papers. White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.

Work to be performed will require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability.  Also, personnel identified for assignment must be cleared for access to SECRET information, at the time of award.  However, a TOP SECRET facility clearance and key personnel cleared for access to SI/TK information prior to award may be required dependent upon the work to be performed and information utilized. A principal investigator clause may be required on these efforts.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR MIFT. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.    Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the Multi-Intelligence Fusion for TCTs portion of this PRDA to AFRL/IFEA, ATTN: Robert Macior, Ref. PRDA 02-02-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505. White Papers are limited to a total page count of five (5) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  White Papers must contain a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2006. It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year to maximize the possibility of award. However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.  The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual White Paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other White Papers submitted under the announcement.    Additional White Paper preparation instructions may be found at:  http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Information on ASF will be provided by the government to the IFSI and MIFT contractors for use under this program. The necessary hardware required for the software integration into the AFRL Fusion Facility and targeted transition facility will be provided as Base Support.  However, the IFSI and MIFT contractors shall be required to provide hardware at their own facility for architecture development and integration during the contract period-of-performance.  This hardware shall be compatible with the targeted facilities. No GFE will be provided to the IFSI or MIFT contractors for development use in their facility. The IFSI offerors shall specify, and provide if awarded, any reference image or display background required for the geo-registration/time synchronization for the fusion of the multi-spectral data. Other required GFI data shall be specified in the proposal for evaluation.  The total value for all awards under the PRDA is $9.5M for the IFSI portion and $15.4M for the MIFT portion, which equates to a total $24,900,000 ceiling.  Foreign participation is not authorized for this acquisition.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2006. All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 02-02-IFKA. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/LaRC as a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit responses from interested parties.  This notice, which is for information and planning purposes only, allows industry the opportunity to provide feedback on their ideas for revolutionary system concepts for aeronautics and their capabilities to analytically assess the potential benefits of these concepts. This document will also verify reasonableness and feasibility of future program requirements and promote competition.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions via electronic transmission (i.e. e-mail) to: Liliana J. Richwine at liliana.j.richwine@nasa.gov, no later than June 30, 2005.  When responding reference NNL050RSCA1L. This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI.  However, the information received through this RFI will be utilized to assist in formulating future requirements and an   implementation strategy for the RSCA Program. A part of that strategy may include competitive procurements.  Background: The Revolutionary System Concepts for Aeronautics (RSCA) Program is sponsored by the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. The RSCA Program supports annual system studies that examine revolutionary system concepts and missions for research areas related to NASA’s strategic objectives for aeronautics. The RSCA Program goals are to formulate revolutionary/alternative missions, to develop associated aeronautics system architectures/concepts and to provide related technology requirements that will enable these missions/concepts to be implemented. Revolutionary/alternative missions and system concepts are needed to help guide NASA’s technology investment strategies beyond current program planning horizons. The RSCA Program focus is on system concepts that could potentially operate in the 2025 to 2035 timeframe.	 Research Areas: Each of the following Research Areas contains a general description of NASA’s requirements for revolutionary aeronautics system concepts for that area. White papers that describe system concepts for one or more of these areas are solicited along with the offeror’s capabilities to analytically assess the potential benefits of these concepts. NASA is interested in revolutionary system concepts that have not previously been studied and which could potentially operate in the 2025 to 2035 timeframe.  Technical questions or comments may be directed to d.w.Bartlett@larc.nasa.gov or at phone number 757-864-1916. 1. – National Air Transportation System Areas of Interest – Revolutionary/alternative system architectural concepts that could accommodate significant increases in air transportation system capacity without compromising safety and security are solicited. These concepts could include alternatives to the hub and spoke system, innovative schemes for air traffic management or revolutionary aircraft concepts that could change the current paradigm of how people and cargo are transported.  Also, revolutionary/alternative system concepts that could provide enhanced security for the National Air Transportation System without adversely impacting capacity are solicited. 2. – Aircraft Environmental Areas of Interest – Revolutionary/alternative aircraft concepts that offer dramatic reductions in noise and emissions are solicited. Both subsonic and supersonic transport-type aircraft that employ alternative fuels and revolutionary propulsion systems are of interest. These aircraft would utilize revolutionary airframe and propulsion systems and operational procedures to achieve dramatic reductions in noise and emissions while maintaining efficient cruise performance.    3. – Unmanned Airborne Vehicles – Revolutionary/alternative airborne vehicle concepts with the capability to operate independently and for very long duration are solicited. These vehicles could serve as platforms for instrument packages related to science, communications, and surveillance, and could also support missions of interest for homeland security. In addition, revolutionary, unmanned flyer concepts for use as science platforms in the atmospheres of other planets and moons are solicited.  RFI Requirements and Preparation of White Papers: Interested parties wishing to provide information on a revolutionary system concept for aeronautics, should submit a white paper of no more than five pages that is related to a particular topic in one of the research areas listed above. A separate white paper is requested for each system concept submitted.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers of Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump as described follows:   

The U.S. Coast Guard desires new replacement C-130 engine driven hydraulic pumps for the T-56A-15.  The engine driven hydraulic pump shall be a fit, form, function, and drop-in replacement requiring no modifications to the existing hydraulic systems.  The engine driven hydraulic pump shall be of the variable-volume type capable of approximately 8.6 gallons per minute (GPM) at 2525 pounds per square inch (PSI) and maintain system pressure of 3000 PSI.  This pump must be of high reliability and of a proven design.  No prototype units will be considered.

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options.  Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.  Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the pump.  Additionally detail if the pump has been qualified for use in any DOD or Federal Government Aircraft.  The Government believes the applicable NAICS code is 336412 Aircraft Engine & Engine Parts.  

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC’s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC’s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.  After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD.     Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to Lillia Sessoms at Bldg 78, U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to lsessoms@arsc.uscg.mil.  TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Responses must be received no later than 18 May 2005 at 13:00 p.m. PST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Tera Sinclair, 586-574-5225
<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, PM Light Tactical Vehicle (PM LTV) Office Warren, MI is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey due 6 May 05.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This marke t survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM-Warren.  Request for Technical Solutions to Protect Exposed Gunners during HMMWV Rollover.  The PEO Combat Support & Combat Service Support and the P M Tactical Vehicles are looking for feasible materiel solutions to help protect exposed gunners during HMMWV Rollover events.  The major issues with the current system are:(1) During a rollover event the gunner is either thrown from gunners hatch or trapp ed partially in hatch resulting in serious injury or death.(2) There is currently no restraining system in place for the gunner for protection during a rollover or extreme maneuvering that could accidentally eject the gunner.  Other issues with the current  systems are:(1)Gunners typically wear field gear such as ammo pouches, canteens, a helmet, and protective body armor that can restrict their ability to quickly move down and out of hatch area.(2)  Heavy interior loading on the floor of the HMMWV sometimes  restricts the gunners ability to quickly move down and out of hatch area.  The proposed system should strongly consider the ease of application of its system to existing (fielded) HMMWVs.  The offeror must:(1) Provide a clear, complete, and specific desc ription of their experience in designing, developing, testing, and manufacturing rollover protection and occupant restraint systems.(2) Be capable of producing a large quantity of rollover protection and gunner restraint systems in a short period of time.  The proposed gunner rollover and restraint protection system should:  Provide materiel solution for gunner survival during a rollover event and accidental ejection from extreme maneuvering.  Have little impact on the gunner's operations (e.g.visibility, t urret motion, gunners ability for 360° +  freedom of movement).  Be applicable to up-armored HMMWVs and HMMWVs with add-on-armor.  Be applicable to vehicles with and with out Gunner Protection Kits and Gunner Shields.  Have no significant reduction in the  current performance and stability characteristics of up-armored HMMWVs.  Allow for easy ingress/egress.  Previously tested prototype or at least a mature concept design that can be rapidly prototyped and tested (desired). Be affordable (desired).  Manufac turable in quantities (greater than 1000) within 6 months(desired).  Please respond with the following information by 6 May 05:  Technical summary of the proposed solution (include description, pictures/drawings, manufacturers, references, etc.).  Specific ations such as weight, performance and ease of installation on existing (fielded) HMMWVs.  Cost Estimate and availability of orders of 500 and 2,000 vehicle sets.  Contact Information for follow-up questions.  Integration requirements for the HMMWV (i.e. E lectrical, hydraulic, mounting location, etc.).  Prototype hardware needs to be demonstrated by 13 May 05 (If feasible):  Information provided is for government assessment on what is available to meet government needs.  However information provided will be  shared with ARCCA Inc. so they can provide information to us from a subject matter expert perspective.  Additionally, AMG corp. will also receive requested information, since they need to evaluate proposed solution integration into vehicles for which they  are the OEM.  Respondents must be prepared to enter into non-disclosure agreements with ACRRA and AM General, if necessary for evaluation of their solution.  Respondents must label any technical data sent to in response to this market survey with restrict ive markings, if the response contains any trade secrets, proprietary data or other confidential information that the respondents want protected.  Interested so urces may obtain copies of this Market Survey located under Market Surveys and Sources Sought Notices on the TACOM Acquisition Web Page at:  http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/opportunity.htm.  All interested firms regardless of size are encouraged to respo nd to this announcement.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK:
Storm Drain Outfall Mapping 
 Outfall mapping is required as part of the RIPDES storm water illicit discharge detection and elimination program and is expected to be implemented by the second year of the program. The outfall mapping must be developed and implemented to comply with the RIPDES permit. Outfall mapping must be of sufficient accuracy to allow identification of individual pipe locations in the field. The existing NAVSTANPT CADD drawings are not accurate enough to comply with this requirement. Outfall mapping needs to be completed north of Gate 32 and the eastern shore of Coaster's Harbor south to the Naval Hospital, including verification of twelve (12) outfalls obscured by vegetation. 

 The outfall mapping is necessary to ensure that the permit is in compliance with the RIPDES regulations and to avoid violation of the R.I. General Laws and any penalties issued as a result of non-compliance. If the outfall mapping program does not obtain funding and is not performed as outlined by RIPDES, NAVSTANPT will not be able to demonstrate continual compliance with the RIPDES permit. 

 As stated in the RIDEM RIPDES General Permit, failure to implement the SWMP, make inspections or maintain records, constitutes a violation of the permit and enforcement actions under 46-12 of R.I. General Laws may result. Enforcement actions may include permit termination, revocation and reissuance, modification, or the denial of a permit renewal application and the imposition of penalties. R.I. General Law 46-12-16, Prosecution of Violations, states that the director of the RIDEM, without being required to enter into any recognizance or to give surety for costs, may institute civil or criminal proceedings for the violation of any provision of Chapter 46-12 or of any permit, rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant thereto. 


Dry Weather Storm Drain Outfall Sampling 
 Dry weather sampling is required as part of the SWMP and is expected to be completed by the fourth year of the program. As specified by the SWMP, NAVSTANPT will conduct dry weather sampling at their properties that discharge to the Narragansett Bay, Coddington Cove and Coasters Harbor. To comply with the RIPDES guidelines, the sampling must include field tests of selected parameters and bacteria. NAVSTANPT must perform a minimum of one survey between July 1st- October 31st by the fourth year of the program. Dry weather flow has been identified for 38 outfalls. Dry weather survey results must be summarized in a table and must include, at a minimum, the following information in order to demonstrate compliance: 
• Location, size and type of outfall 
• Flow (presence/absence) 
• Samples collected 
• Sample results 
• Results of other parameters 
• Sample analysis method 

 The dry weather storm drain outfall sampling is necessary to ensure that the permit is in compliance with the RIPDES guidelines and to avoid violation of the R.I. General Laws and any penalties issued as a result of non-compliance. If the dry weather storm drain outfall sampling does not obtain funding and is not performed as outlined by RIPDES, NAVSTANPT will not be able to demonstrate continual compliance with the RIPDES permit. As stated in the RIDEM RIPDES General Permit, failure to implement the SWMP, make inspections or maintain records, constitutes a violation of the permit and enforcement actions under 46-12 of R.I. General Laws may result. Enforcement actions may include permit termination, revocation and reissuance, modification, or the denial of a permit renewal application and the imposition of penalties. R.I. General Law 46-12-16, Prosecution of Violations, states that the director of the RIDEM, without being required to enter into any recognizance or to give surety for costs, may institute civil or criminal proceedings for the violation of any provision of Chapter 46-12 or of any permit, rule, regulation, or order issued pursuant thereto. 

Storm Drain Stenciling Program 

Although storm drain stenciling was not included as an educational tool in the Stormwater Management Plan, stenciling is one way NAVSTANPT can comply with the minimum measures for public education and outreach on stormwater impacts. It is anticipated that the stenciling program will help prevent direct dumping and runoff into Narragansett Bay. 

Laptop and Software Purchase and Storm Water Outfall Database Demonstration 

Since the storm water outfall database will require special GIS software to view and manipulate the data, a powerful enough computer should be identified which will be solely used for GIS. In order to use the GIS database for the storm water outfalls, a laptop will be purchased with ArcGIS software. This will allow NAVSTANPT to continue to comply with the RIDEM RIPDES General Permit by updating the database as maintenance and improvement information becomes available. 

SCOPE OF SERVICES

Task 1 Outfall Mapping:  Vendor has estimated 18 outfalls on the 2002 drainage maps for the area between Gate 32 (the golf course) and north to Melville North and 12 outfalls in the Coaster’s Harbor and Naval Hospital areas. The drainage maps show the details of the storm water conveyance systems including outfalls and receiving water bodies. Two Vendor personnel will spend four eight hour days (64 hours), to locate with a GPS and map the 30 outfalls, and will also verify twelve (12) other outfalls that may be obscured by vegetation. This will also include field preparation and GPS data download. Vendor shall develop a GIS map which will include the storm drain outfalls overlaid on the 1997 black and white 1:5000 ortho-rectified MrSID images as the base of the GIS project. A GIS database shall also be created to include details on the storm drain outfall including type of pipe, size of pipe, presence/absence of flow, and date of inspection. 

Task 2:  Dry Weather Outfall Sampling:  Vendor shall complete one dry weather outfall sampling between July 1 - October 31, 2005 at 38 storm water outfalls at the NAVSTANPT. The survey shall be conducted no less than 72 hours after the last rainfall of 0.10 inch or more. Any discharges from an outfall will be collected and analyzed for temperature, conductivity, pH, and bacteria. In the field, visual observations will be made for presence/absence of flow, odors, sheen, stressed vegetation, coloration and staining, algae growth, sedimentation, scouring and erosion. Two Vendor personnel shall spend two ten (10) hour days to prepare, sample and record data. The samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory and Vendor shall develop a letter report to provide documentation of methods and equipment. Laboratory results will also be appended to the report. 

Task 3: Storm Drain Stenciling Program: Vendor shall complete a storm drain stenciling program between July 1 – October 31, 2005. NAVSTANPT drainage maps shall be reviewed to identify the location of the storm drains. The phrase “No Dumping – Drains to the Bay” will be spray painted on the top center of the storm drain. Two Vendor personnel shall spend two eight hour days (48 hours), to locate and stencil storm drains. This will include field preparation time, as well as review of the drainage maps to identify storm drain locations. Vendor shall develop a letter report indicating the areas where storm drains were stenciled which can be used for the RIDEM annual report. 

Task 4: Laptop and Software Purchase and Storm Water Outfall Database Consultation: Vendor shall purchase a 3790 Notebook (laptop) with the following specifications:  Mobile Pentium 735 @ 1.7 Ghz, 512 Mb DDR RAM, 60 Gb Hard Drive, DVD/CDRW Drive, No Floppy, ATI Mobil Radeon 9700 With 128 Mb RAM, Windows XP Pro, 15.4" Active Matrix TFT In Wide Screen Format, Wireless Networking 802.11B/G, Carrying Case, Built In Camera, 6 Cell Li-Ion Battery, 3 * USB 2.0 Ports, 1 * 1394 Port.

Vendor shall install and verify the software operation and the storm water GIS database and mapping project on the computer and provide three (3) hours of consultation on how to operate the database with ArcView 3.3.

·	For help with registration in CCR, contact the CCR Help desk, 888-227-2423 or e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.

2.  Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).
·	All vendors desiring to quote on goods or services in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/.  
·	Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/Fax number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc).
·	Note:  All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually.  Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.

3.  Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).
·	The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company.  You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm.
·	To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on “Search CCR.”  Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click “Submit Query.”  If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.
·	Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.  There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC.  If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet.  If you see that there is no one listed as your company’s EB POC, you need to click on “Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN” to add it.
·	Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC’s (primary and alternate) for each CAGE/DUNS combination.
·	The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor’s organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.
·	Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.  Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete.  For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html





4.  Establish a group in WAWF-RA associated with your cage code(s).  This can be 
     done by calling DISA-Ogden Customer Support at 1-800-392-1798 or by
     e-mailing cscassig@ogden.disa.mil

5.  Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM).  (Proceed to paragraph 6 if you are not going to designate a GAM).
·	In medium to large sized companies, there may be need to establish more than one GAM.
·	A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account.
·	The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC.  To appoint additional GAM’s, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC.
·	The appointment letter should be faxaed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	The Group Administrator’s Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.
·	The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.

6.  Establish an organizational e-mail address
·	All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes, the system generates an e-mail notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm’s organizational e-mail account.
·	The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational e-mail to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	Ensure that your firm’s organizational e-mail address is operational and can receive e-mail from WAWF-RA prior to registering your e-mail address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	Note:  If you do not set up an organizational e-mail address, the personal e-mail address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational e-mail address for your firm.

7.  Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA
·	Set up the PCs of your organization’s users to access WAWF-RA.
·	Select the “Setting Up Your Machine” link on the WAWF-RA home page.  For more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.

8.  Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA website
·	Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA website by completing the on-line registration form.
·	Select the “Self Register” link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions.
·	Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate.  Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering.
·	PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operation Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com.  The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate.
·	If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center. 
·	Note:  Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an e-mail from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR database.
