<DESC>The 105-H Reactor Building is located within the Hanford Site in the 100-H Area on the south bank of the Columbia River.  Approximately 35 river miles upstream and 32 road miles from the city of Richland, in the southeastern corner of Washington state.

The recirculation gas system provided an inert helium-carbon dioxide mixture, which was a non-radioactive gas environment in the reactor. The inert recirculation gas removed moisture and foreign gases from the reactor; served as the heat transfer media between the graphite and process tubes for removal of heat from the graphite; and detected water leaks within the reactor.  A helium-nitrogen mixture was used for the last several years.

SUBCONTRACTOR shall be responsible for concrete demolition fracturing with controlled explosives or expansive grout of the heavy concrete structures, 3ft (0.9m) thick portion of the gas wing to include mobilization, dust and fragment projectile controls, drilling, waste handling (excluding demolition rubble), demobilization, and other work necessary to fracture heavy concrete material into no larger than 0.9m (3ft) in dimension in accordance with this contract. The CONTRACTOR will remove demolition rubble

The gas recirculation portion of the wing physical dimensions is:
„h approximately 27.7 m (91 ft) in width,
„h with the operational gallery floor extending approximately 58.2 m (191 ft) in length over the gas tunnel and extending into process cells that is approximately 0.9 m (3 ft) thick,
„h the pipe tunnel is approximately 11 m (36 ft) wide by approximately 3.7 m (12 ft) high and runs the length of the building¡¦s gas ventilation wing,
„h three dryer rooms and one filter room extending approximately 35.7 m (117 ft) in length on the north perimeter,
„h two blower rooms and one filter room extending approximately 16.5 m (54 ft) in length on the south perimeter and
„h with approximately 5.5 m (18 ft)-high cell ceilings that are approximately 0.9 m (3 ft) thick. 

No entry can be made to the gas equipment cells from the operating gallery, as cell entry is from the outside of the building wing via a labyrinth.  The gas equipment cell walls, ceilings, and floors are constructed of approximately 0.9-m (3-ft)-thick reinforced concrete.

Construction drawings and concrete core break data will be provided as part of the subcontract documents.  The primary pay item within the Subcontract will be lump sum. The subcontractor will be expected to provide a full-time on-site site superintendent, a full-time on-site health and safety/IH representative, and a project manager.  The subcontractor will also be expected to have engineering resources available. For prequalification, go to the Bechtel Hanford, Inc website at

  POSITION DESCRIPTION
 
Introduction:  

After the decade of wars in the region and sanctions, Montenegro has been working to emerge as a democratic state with a market driven economy.  The USAID Program in Montenegro is designed to facilitate this transition. The program commenced on a limited scale at the end of 1997, and initial grants from USAID to several NGOs were made shortly thereafter.  Humanitarian relief programs (Food For Peace) and Office of Transition Initiatives programs began around the same time.  The USAID-funded economic reform program started in 1999, with a focus limited to privatization. Around the time that Yugoslav forces mobilized and occupied Kosovo, in early 1999, and NATO retaliated with air strikes, the Montenegro program increased dramatically.  By the summer of 1999, a major budget support effort was initiated and the economic reform program expanded into new policy areas.  USAID/Kosovo & Montenegro assumed management responsibility for the expanding program.  However, because USAID staff could not establish a full-time presence in Montenegro for security reasons, the impact of the assistance program was somewhat limited, especially with regard to policy reform which requires constant and continuing hands on effort.

With the fall of Milosevic in September/October 2000, USAID personnel were permitted to work in Montenegro on a more continuous basis, though with some lingering restrictions.  By April 2001, the situation had begun to “normalize,” establishment of a full-time USAID staff in Montenegro commenced, and management of the program was transferred from Pristina to Belgrade.  The USAID program now includes a diverse portfolio in economic policy reform, private sector development, democracy and governance, community development, and local government (approximately $189 million from 1991 to 1993).

USAID implementers have played a key role in working with the Government of Montenegro in implementing its economic reform program.  The goal of the program is to transform the economy of Montenegro from a static, centrally planned system damaged by a decade of intermittent sanctions and disrupted regional markets, to a modern market driven economy with linkages rebuilt to the region and the world.  The early stages of the program involved the drafting of considerable legislation to transform the business regulatory and banking environment and make it consistent with international best practice and EU directives.  The current program is focused largely on implementation of this legislation and other reforms.

Critical legislation passed by mid-year 2003 includes:  an organic budget law;  a public procurement law;  law on the central bank and bank bankruptcy legislation;  a comprehensive set of tax laws including personal and corporate income, property, excise, and value added taxes, as well as a new tax administration code;  business regulatory legislation including a new business organization law which vastly simplified the procedures for starting a business, a modern bankruptcy law, a concessions law, and a movable property pledge law;  an accounting and auditing law, calling for the implementation of IAS in the Republic;  an energy law calling for the establishment of an independent regulator;  and amendments to the Law on Banks and the off-shore companies act, effectively ending Montenegro’s tenure as one of the last bastions of total secrecy in off-shore banking.

Considerable focus is being placed on implementing these laws and building the responsible institutions.  With USAID support, the department of public revenues is undergoing a full functional restructuring and implementation of a new IT system to assist in collections and taxpayer services.  The treasury system is now tracking all public expenditures and revenues.  USAID has also assisted in the start-up of the new accounting Institute to govern the accounting profession, as well as conducted extensive training of accountants, companies and trainers to prepare them for the new legislation.

On the commercial side, the business organization Law has been effectively implemented with over 15,000 companies re-registered into a new Internet accessible registry.  The six main bankruptcy judges finished a study tour in the United States, equipping them to deal with the new reorganization and voluntary restructuring provisions in the bankruptcy law.  Along with assistance from USAID advisors, a group of university professors is re-designing the law school curriculum to take account of new and changed legislation.

Ongoing training and implementation assistance was also provided in areas including:  reform of the payments system and the movement of payments services from the centralized, monopoly payments bureau to the commercial banks.  Though this has proceeded more slowly than hoped, the government has adopted an aggressive timetable for 2003.  Other ongoing elements of the program include:  financial system reform including on and off-site supervision capacity building and problem bank resolution; public procurement training;  and public education on all legislation developed with USAID support.

Key legislation developed in 2002 and still in the pipeline which is to have a major effect on the transformation of the Montenegrin economy includes the Pension law, which will help bring the pension system back into balance, lessening the severe fiscal pressures the system now exerts.  Anti-money laundering and anti-corrupt practices legislation was also developed and is also slated for Parliamentary approval later in 2003.

In early 2003, following the election of a stable ruling coalition, USAID assisted the GOM in developing a comprehensive four year Economic Reform Agenda.  USAID and BearingPoint, as the main policy reform implementer, have been meeting on a monthly basis with the Prime Minister and Cabinet to track and discuss progress.

Private sector development continues to be an important part of USAID efforts in Montenegro.  Opportunity Bank, starting as a micro credit program, opened as a full service bank in September 2002 to serve SMEs.  To date they have lent $5,782,250 to 2,339 clients where some 9,000 jobs have been generated or saved.  The Montenegro Business Alliance, an association of business owners founded under USAID implementer CIPE, has been active in arranging four regional business forums with similar groups in other countries to tie back together regional business connections.  Several million Euros in contracts have been arranged at these meetings.  Another implementer began in 2002 working on the restructuring of six of the larger companies newly privatized under the mass voucher privatization program and is also involved in conducting accounting and management seminars throughout the republic.

A new private sector development/competitiveness activity is proposed for start-up late in 2003.

Duties and Responsibilities of the Position:

Based in Podgorica, the PSC Senior Finance and Economic Advisor (SFEA) will be responsible for development and oversight of economic policy, institutional reform, and private sector development projects in Montenegro.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, (the "Company"), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is requesting an Expression Of Interest (EOI) from prospective vendors to provide support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  This EOI serves as a method of identifying potential vendors; and is being offered on behalf of the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies.  

To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements:  reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs.  Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved.  New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives.  Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals.  

The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this EOI to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels.  It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs.  It is broken into two subtopics for consideration.  

A.	SUBTOPIC I

The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles.  

Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control.  In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications.  However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control.  This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC.  The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device.  Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels.

Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production.  
It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases.  Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work.  Technological innovations will be highly encouraged.  A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented.  A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included.  A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones.  

The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip.   It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years.

B)	SUBTOPIC II

This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles.    It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW.  An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW.    The SOW will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs.  

The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations.  The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues.  The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units.  A viable path to production must be demonstrated.  A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively.  Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions.  Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified.  The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles.   A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation.  The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle.    It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. 

The intent of this EOI is to identify prospective vendors who can provide this support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  Teaming arrangements are acceptable.  Once viability of subcontracting part or all of this scope is determined by ORNL, a detailed RFP will be issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements.  Please provide your EOI submittal to Christine M. Sullivan by e-mail (sullivancm@ornl.gov) or fax (865) 241-2426 by close of business March 20, 2003.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research and development proposals addressing innovative technology for electro-optical range-resolved vibrational imaging sensors for a wide range of military missions, including buried land mine detection using acoustic probes. The overall goal of the program is to develop sensor technologies for efficient, high precision vibrational and range imaging. Intrinsic near-shot-noise-limited detector/amplifier arrays are desired. Direct heterodyne, high local oscillator fluence solutions are discouraged, although other approaches, including, for example, low local oscillator fluence heterodyne, autodyne, or homodyne concepts, will be considered. The laser receiver sensors will consist of multi-element (> 1000 pixel) detector arrays capable of receiving laser returns and extracting range data and vibrational signatures at each picture element of the array. The receiver array will respond to radiation in the eye-safe wavelength bands. Spectral agility to longer wavelengths to penetrate atmospheric obscurants is desired but not required. Technology critical to success includes detectors/amplifiers with high bandwidth and near-shot-noise-limited performance to respond to the small signal expected from the return pulse, read-out integrated circuits capable of noise reduction processing, unique signal processing to accurately resolve range and vibrational information, and optical components for filtering and pre-processing the information. Systems that demonstrate this technology will collect the vibrational and range image in as short a time as possible, and avoid the use of scanning mechanisms to illuminate the target scene or to record the image.  The emphasis of this program is on the vibrational imaging transmitter/receiver and signal processing electronics. Pictures depicting the conceptual buried land mine detection application, as well as a basic block diagram of a potential system embodiment can be viewed on the DARPA/MTO website ICHOR solicitation page.

The imaging receiver should produce a vibrational and range image in which each pixel records the distance from the sensor to an incremental part of the sensor field-of-view (FOV), and samples and processes the laser return data to obtain the vibrational signature of the target with extreme sensitivity. The imaging technology should be capable of measuring the vibrational response of soil over anti-tank mines at acoustic frequencies of up to several kHz. The systems should be sized for platforms from micro-vehicles to Future Combat Systems tactical ground vehicles. The data collection and processing should be robust enough to produce the image under the condition of platform motion and vibration. The goal is to operate near the eye-safe wavelength of 1.5 microns, but the flexibility to image at longer wavelengths to overcome limitation imposed by weather is desirable. 

The size, weight, and electrical power requirements of a candidate range-resolved vibrational sensor are critical issues. In all cases, highly efficient use of laser transmitter energy is desired to minimize system size, weight and power. DARPA is seeking breakthrough approaches in detector sensitivity, electronics bandwidth, and signal processing which will lead to system demonstrations.


DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  I. Integrated Laser Source/Detector/Signal Processor - The integrated source/optics/array/read-out circuit performs several essential functions, including transmission and detection of low level, high speed optical signals; processing the information to obtain the precise range to each picture element; processing multiple returns over a sufficient time interval to obtain ultrasensitive vibrational spectra, and conditioning the information for read-out to an off-chip processor or display; and II. Supporting Technology - The goal of realizing range-resolved integrated sensor systems will be supported by research focusing on materials/detector structures, and unique signal processing components. This technology is meant to enhance the detection capability, noise reduction, and the ability to fabricate extremely low power systems. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 04-02 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards totaling approximately $60 million over four years are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2004.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site—https://www.davincinetbook.com/teams--has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is J. Andrew Hutchinson, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: ahutchinson@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 04-02, Imaging Coherent Optical Radar (ICHOR), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on Imaging Coherent Optical Radar, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/, the Federal Grant Opportunities (FedGrants) website at URL http://fedgrants.gov/, or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and nine (9) copies of the proposal abstracts as specified in the Proposer Information Pamphlet, along with two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 04-02) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, December 19, 2003.  File formats for the electronic copies shall be PDF, and MS-Word-readable. Media for each copy may be a single CD-ROM, a single 100 Megabyte Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5-inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte diskette. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-02, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy number __ of 2.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and nine (9) copies of the full proposal as specified in the Proposer Information Pamphlet, along with two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 04-02) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, February 20, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants. File formats for the electronic copies shall be PDF, and MS-Word-readable. Media for each copy may be a single CD-ROM, a single 100 Megabyte Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5-inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte diskette. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-02, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy number __ of 2.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-02 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.

<DESC>The Range Instrumentation Systems Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, plans to award a sole-source contract to Cubic Defense Applications, Inc. (CDA), 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123, for the acquisition of an operationally critical Range Security Enhancement (RSE) for the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS) at Nellis AFB, Nevada.   The RSE will integrate classified and compartmented programs within the existing NACTS training and exercise programs to improve efficiency, effectiveness and synergy of operational capabilities. The Air Force has a requirement to integrate sources of mission participant information using Link-16 data from various systems including all Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) terminals and the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS LVT) variants 1, 2 and 3.  The MIDS LVT3 [or Fighter Data Link (FDL)] is used on F-15 aircraft.  The NACTS RSE must provide capability to receive Link-16 messages delivered on an Internet Protocol (IP) Network, process user selected messages, and display user selected Link-16 information on networked debriefing workstations [Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS) and Advanced Display & Debriefing System (ADDS) Type A Upgrade (ATAU)] and on ICADS debriefing workstations used for debriefing non-NACTS instrumented participants.
CDA has the resources to successfully accomplish NACTS RSE and is uniquely capable of performing the tasks since they developed, installed, and modified the existing training systems under the initial NACTS program.  In addition, ICADS is a proprietary product of CDA and is not available from any other source.   Information associated with this effort is unclassified, or classified up to, and including, SECRET. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Ida M. Ramirez, ida.ramirez@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9391 x 5081, FAX (850) 882-3226.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the solicitation.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the size standard for this requirement is $4M.  Solicitation 4MC4A301is issued as a Request for Quotation H94003-04-T-4001 and is sole source to EagleST, 3778 Eagle St, San Diego, CA, 92103.  This requirement is for UTSi Radiation Hardness and SiGe Assessment in accordance with Statement of Work DMEA04-4A7 dated 27 October 2003.  The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), located in Sacramento, CA, is under the authority, direction and control of the Deputy under Secretary of Defense for Logistics.  In addition to supporting numerous defense organizations, DMEA also supports other federal agencies, state governments, U.S. industries and foreign establishments.  The DMEA provides technologically correct and economically viable solutions to microelectronics obsolescence.  DMEA’s engineering specialists, supported by complex design, analysis, test and prototyping equipment, produce solutions that are technically correct, logistically supportable, schedule responsive and fiscally affordable.
The Department of Defense (DOD) increasingly relies on the use of “smart” weapon systems.  The components that make up these systems are the complex microelectronics devices that form their “brains”.  Microelectronics technologies are extremely dynamic and, on the average, become obsolete every 18 months.  However, DOD weapon systems using such technologies have increased life cycles that commonly last for 40 or 50 years.  The disparity between the long life cycles for weapons systems and the short life of microelectronics technology sources is the main factor driving DoD system obsolescence and mission degradation.  DMEA has the responsibility of addressing these issues by using advanced technologies to extend the life of these systems.  DMEA provides form, fit, and/or function replacements of microelectronics and transitions new technology into systems through its Logistics Retrofit Engineering (LRE) program.  Development, production and test of radiation-hardened microelectronics using processes licensed to DMEA is a necessary component of this support.  As such, implementing these processes in ways which ensure specified levels of radiation-hardness or tolerance is of great importance.  This project is one part of a major research and development program at DMEA which incorporates many interrelated and interdependent projects.
The purpose of this task is to perform research, analysis, and testing efforts necessary for improving and assuring the radiation tolerance/hardness of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) processes currently being installed and to be installed in the DMEA flexible foundry.  Specific activities to be accomplished include: researching the impacts of implementing licensed processes into the flexible foundry on radiation tolerance and performance in the military environment; and developing the means by which these processes might be controlled, tested and hardened for better performance in strategic space radiation environments.
The contractor shall perform all tasks required to ensure that the program meets performance, cost and schedule requirements.  These shall include: scheduling of activities and deliverables; describing status; outlining contractor activity and progress toward accomplishing objectives; planning, program planning; describing the overall results of the effort; and documenting new technology breakthroughs; and any other management techniques deemed appropriate.  The contractor shall also report technical accomplishments, potential problem areas, results of conferences, and authorized directives from the contracting officer.  The contractor shall designate a task manager who shall be directly responsible for all aspects described in this SOW.  The task manager shall be the point of contact for the government.  The Contractor shall maintain a status of their effort towards achieving the SOW objectives, including all technical activities and efforts, problems/deficiencies, impacts, recommended solutions, etc.  The contractor shall participate in Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) or technical reviews as required.  All such meetings shall be held at DMEA.  Certification by the Government of satisfactory services provided is contingent upon the contractor’s performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the referenced contract, the SOW, the approved proposal, and all amendments.
DMEA will provide the contractor with access to the DMEA Science and Engineering Gamma Irradiation Test (SEGIT) facility’s two Cobalt-60 irradiators and environmental test chambers on a non-interference basis as needed to complete the tasks specified herein.  Travel may be required during the conduct of this task.  Travel shall be approved upon task award.  Additional travel is authorized only upon written approval by the government.The contractor shall provide a quarterly status report of their effort towards achieving the task objectives, including all technical activities and efforts, conclusions made, expenditure of program funds, schedule, problems/deficiencies, impacts, and recommended solutions.  The contractor shall also participate in quarterly meetings with the government to review status.  (DI-MGMT-80368)  The contractor shall research and analyze the DMEA Flexible Foundry COTS UTSi process and develop improvements to ensure that parts produced using the process are capable of operating in strategic space radiation environments.  The contractor shall analyze current technology deficiencies and develop and evaluate new test procedures, process enhancements, and process control modules. The contractor shall research the radiation hardness of the DMEA Si-Ge process. The contractor shall also support the ongoing COTS BX/SN03 process hardening and hardness assurance activities. (DI-A-3027A)  Process Hardening and Hardness Assurance Research and Development.  The contractor shall research and recommend any additional process hardening techniques for the UTSi process that are necessary to make this process meet strategic space radiation hardness levels. The contractor shall research and identify which design, layout, and process parameters of these processes must be controlled and how tightly these need to be controlled (quantitatively) to provide strategic space hardness assurance on these processes with a minimum amount of radiation testing.  If necessary, the contractor shall develop a new process control module(s) for the UTSi process for radiation testing.  The contractor shall recommend specific design, layout, and process hardness assurance procedures to be implemented by a Technology Review Board to maintain hardness levels.  The contractor shall also provide a preliminary assessment of the radiation hardness potential of the DMEA PCB40 and SiGe processs and make preliminary recommendations on possible hardening and hardness assurance methods. (DI-MISC-80508)  The contractor shall provide updated technical guidance and support of developmental radiation testing activities.  Special materials shall be provided by the contractor when they are essential to the task performance and specifically approved by the PCO, not to exceed the ceiling price identified in the delivery order.

<P>(*) All missing attachments will be posted to the NARA ERA Acquisition web 
site prior to final release of the RFP. </P>
<P>The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of 
electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, 
enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the 
system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal 
Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, 
and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of 
access, now and for the life of the republic. Detailed background information on 
the ERA program is available at the ERA web site, <A 
href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives</A>.</P>
<P>Based on industry comments, the ERA business and contracting approach has 
been revised to a full-and-open hybrid Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/Cost Plus Award 
Fee (CPAF) competition. The solicitation will be for an initial one (1) year FFP 
base contract period and six (6) CPAF option periods. NARA’s acquisition 
approach is to initially award one or more contracts using a best value 
competition. During the initial System Analysis and Design phase (base contract 
period) the selected contractors each will produce a detailed System 
Requirements Specification and System Design Document. In the event that 
multiple contracts are awarded there will be a down select to a single 
contractor at the end of the base contract period. The selected contractor will 
perform development and deployment of the ERA on an incremental basis. The 
initial option period (increment 1) will be for two (2) years, and the remaining 
option periods (increments 2-5 and a final year of operations and support) will 
be for one (1) year each. </P>
<P>The Government may exercise optional CPAF CLINS for Operations and Support 
(O&S) of the system. The sixth one-year option period will be only for 
O&S of the system as delivered at the end of the fifth increment. This 
represents a change in previously published acquisition strategy in that the 
Government now plans to acquire O&S as part of this ERA acquisition 
contract.</P>
<P>The Draft ERA RFP will only be available by downloading from the ERA 
Acquisition web site at </P>

</P>
<P>Your meaningful comments on this Draft Request for Proposal will be 
appreciated. You are encouraged to serially submit questions or comments as they 
become available. Each comment addressing a specific item in the Draft RFP 
should reference the section and paragraph number. Any comments not addressing a 
specific item in the draft should be marked as General. In order for responses 
to receive full consideration, they should be received by September 17, 2003 at 
5 PM EST. Responses must be submitted electronically to the following email 
address: <A href="mailto:ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov">ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov</A> 
. Responses must be in Microsoft Word format. Please include company name, point 
of contact, mailing address, phone number, and email address.<BR><BR><B>DO NOT 
RESPOND TO THE FEDBIZOPS POINT OF CONTACT.</P></B>
<P>NARA intends to answer as many questions and comments as are deemed 
appropriate. The Government will consider all questions and comments received 
from potential Offerors in preparation of the final RFP. Any changes made will 
be at the sole discretion of the ERA Program Office. </P>
<P>This Draft RFP shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the 
Government to acquire any products or services, and it does not restrict the 
Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Proposals are not requested 
at this time and will not be considered. Any information provided to the 
Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. The 
Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with 
submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by 
interested parties for responses to this Draft RFP. No entitlement to payment of 
direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of 
submission of responses to this Draft RFP and the Government’s use of such 
information. </P>
<P>A final solicitation will be published prior to the end of the 1st quarter FY 
04 with an award being made prior to the end of the 3rd Quarter FY 04.</P>
<P>Please check the NARA ERA Acquisition Web Site Daily for new or updated 
information.</P>
<P>Thank you for your continued interest in the ERA program.</P></BODY></HTML>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The previous notice is revised to read as follows: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 617-04-001 to implement follow-on 44-month Strengthening Decentralization in Uganda II (SDU II) activity. Local governments in Uganda, though in place and functioning, cannot fully perform all the responsibilities and duties devolved to them.  This situation is further complicated by disconnects between the various planning and budgeting processes, as well as the lack of a strong interface between local governments and various elements of the community. Local governments lack capacity to forge sectoral commitments for economic growth and social services, to respond to new allocation formulas under the Fiscal Decentralization System for resource flows to the districts, and to join stakeholders to a political process for effective planning and budgeting. Increasing local revenue generation to meet rising local government staff and services needs involves a parallel challenge to Local governments to engage communities and key tax and fee payers. And, with rising opportunity for corruption in their ranks, local government must adapt to a new set of harmonized regulations for local procurement and to organize the work of Local Tender Boards so as to assure public transparency. Success in addressing these problems will make local governments trusted agents in the redistribution of Central Government transfers, as well as locally generated revenue. USAID has already invested greatly in establishing a strategic framework and creating the enabling processes to support decentralization.  We now move into a critical period in which lessons learned must be applied to the broad base of local government across the country. USAID has identified a select set of critical areas for active engagement which include: planning and budgeting for fiscal decentralization, local procurement processes (including anti corruption), local revenue generation and  support of key USAID sectoral priorities at the local level, specifically HIV/AIDS, Health and Education,  and 2. enabling activities that strengthen community and Community Based  Organization (CBO) linkages with local government, provide effective tools for management, capacity building and service delivery and ultimately contribute to expansion of  the democratic base of local governance. 

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. The anticipated date for issuing the RFP is o/a October 10, 2003.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, (the "Company"), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is requesting proposals from prospective suppliers to provide support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  This Request For Proposal (RFP) is being offered on behalf of the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies.  

To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements:  reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs.  Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved.  New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives.  Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals.  

The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this RFP to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels.  It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs.  It is broken into two subtopics for consideration.  

A.	SUBTOPIC I

The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles.  

Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control.  In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications.  However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control.  This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC.  The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device.  Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels.

Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production.  

It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases.  Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work.  Technological innovations will be highly encouraged.  A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented.  A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included.  A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones.  

The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip.   It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years.

B)	SUBTOPIC II

This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles.    It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW.  An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW.    The Statement of Work (SOW) will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs.  

The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations.  The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues.  The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units.  A viable path to production must be demonstrated.  A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively.  Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions.  Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified.  The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles.   A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation.  The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle.    It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. 

A detailed RFP has been issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements.  An Offeror may elect to bid on one or both subtopics as further described in the RFP.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification #2 is to make changes and additions in the specifications, to change the shipping requirements, to extend the deadline for submission of offers, and to respond to Questions.   
1.  The Specification for the Automated Microplate Washer is changed.  The requirement for 16 channels is deleted.    
2. Offers shall provide price for shipping equipment to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan (16 sets), and USAID/CDC, American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan (19 sets), quoted both for shipment via air freight, and via surface. Delivery is due within 90 days from the effective date of award.  The equipment shall be consigned to the USAID/CDC, US Embassies in these countries. 
3.  Offers are due at 10 AM, Almaty time on October 6, 2003. 
4.  Questions and Answers: 
Question 1: The specification for the microplate washer calls for 8, 12 and 16 channel manifolds.  Does this mean that you would like an 8, 12, and 16 channel manifolds (all 3)  included with the proposal?  Or simply that the washer should have the capability of using these 3 types of manifolds?   
Answer: The washer must be compatible with both 8 and 12 channel manifolds, and must include both. (16 channel capacity is not needed).
Question 2:  Under the pipette tip section, there is no mention of whether the tips are to be bulk (in a bag), box racked,  box rack sterile or rack packs.  What racking configuration is required? Box Racked 200ul and P2/P10 style tips come 960/unit traditionally to accommodate microtitre spacing, not 1000 per unit as is mentioned in the specification.  1000ul tips do come 1000 per unit in both bulk and box racks.  It would be very inconvenient to use the multichannel pipettors mentioned in the solicitation with bagged bulk pipette tips.
Answer: The tips should be bulk, and hence will be nonsterile (we had specified STERILE in the posting). While we realize that it may be less convenient to use the multichannel pipettors mentioned in the solicitation with bulk pipette tips, given the cost difference, the inconvenience is far outweighed by the cost savings.
 
Question 3.  In the RFP it mentions the option of a two step water system with RO or distillation on the front end and a cartridge based polishing system on the back end.  Can you please clarify this?  Is a two step system required (RO or distillation on the front end) or if another configuration will satisfy the requirements, would it be acceptable?  Since it mentions the option of a two step system, would it be possible to offer two choices in water systems? One a classic two step and perhaps a second alternative, without being judged as not having properly responded to the solicitation? 
Answer: The two-step water purification process in the subject RFP was an example of one possible configuration.  The water purification system proposed by the offeror must be capable of producing analytical grade ultrapure water, as stated in solicitation document.  Offerors may propose alternative water purification systems, bearing in mind that price is the most important selection factor.  
 
Question 4.  For the Cryovials mentioned in the RFP, is a silicone seal required?
Answer: A silicone seal is NOT required for the cryovials.
 
Question 5:  Do the displays and printouts from the instruments have to be in Russian or is the requirement that just the manuals be in Russian. 
Answer: The displays and printouts do NOT need to be in Russian, as long as the Russian-language manuals show the English words which would be in displays, and explains the meaning in Russian.  For example, if the display reads Error 6A, the manual should explain the meaning of Error 6A in Russian.  
 
Question 6: What is the speed range for the shaker/rotator in RPM?
Answer: Orbital, variable speed, 100-1500 RPM.  
 
Question 7: Please advise what material the cylinders are to be made from - glass, plastic (what type, ie PMP, PP, PE, etc) and the error limits, graduation marks?
Answer:   (1) Cylinders; Polypropylene or Polymethylpentene; Graduated with 1.0 mL subdivisions; Error limit: < or = 1.0 mL.  (2) Cylinders, 1000 ml; Polypropylene or Polymethylpentene; Graduated with 10.0 mL subdivisions; Error limit: < or = 6.0 mL

Question 8: Please provide the specifications on the centrifuge tubes - conical, constructed of what material, graduated, sterile/nonsterile, etc? 
Answer:   Conical leakproof polypropylene or polystyrene tubes, 15mL, clear or translucent, with polypropylene, polystyrene or polyethylene plug seal cap, nonsterile, graduation marks not necessary
 
Question 9: Specifications for the item listed as CENTRIFUGES. At a minimum, we would need- RPM speed, fixed or variable speed, rotor type, number of places and number of tubes, size of tubes to be spun, timer and range, any other requirements.   
Answer:  Centrifuge for Serum Separation, Speed range: 0-3200 rpm or greater; Maximum Relative Centrifugal Force: 1,212 x g or greater; Timer: at least 30 min in 5 min increments; Tubes accepted: 2-15 mL (or broader; tube holder adjusters must be supplied); Rotor: angled
  
Question 10:  Can you please indicate where we may find 22CFR228.51?  Could you advise where we may find an explanation of the meaning of the following paragraph; or, could you offer an explanation, please?  Origin (country of manufacture) of each product.   The Authorized Geographic Codes for this contract are 000 (United States) and 110 (independent countries of the former Soviet Union).   If a 000 or 110-origin product is not available, the offeror must provide an explanation and request a waiver in accordance with 22CFR228.51.  The origin of the products we could offer differ from the codes 000 or 110. Could we still proceed with our products? 
Answer: 22CFR 228.51 may be found at the following link: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/22cfr228_01.html
It is a Federal Regulation that specifies administrative practice and procedures regarding Source, Origin and Nationality of USAID-financed commodities and services.  For this solicitation, products manufactured in and shipped from countries in Geographic Codes 000 and 110 are being sought.  However, if one of the required products is not manufactured in any of the authorized countries, then the offeror may propose a product manufactured elsewhere, with an explanation and request for a waiver of the geographic restriction.  There is no prescribed format or form for a waiver request. For example, if there is no company in the United States or the independent countries of the former Soviet Union that manufactures an incubator that meets the solicitation’s specifications, then an offeror may propose a product manufactured elsewhere.  Geographic code 000 is defined as USA. Geographic Code 110 is defined as New Independent States - Collective for New Independent States of the former Soviet Union.
 
Question 11. NAICS code is 541990. Does it mean that the company whose business status is not applicable to this code could not send their offers? 
Answer:  The code is intended to describe the product or service, not the seller.    
 
Question 12: For some of the countries in question, standard freight delivery services will not deliver palletized goods to the US embassy. Since the bid calls for a delivery cost to the US embassy in each of the countries mentioned, is one able to quote the delivery cost to the airport only, if obvious carriers such as Federal Express will not deliver palletized goods directly to the embassy? 
Answer: 16 sets of equipment must be consigned to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan.  19 sets of equipment must be consigned to USAID/CDC,  American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  Freight costs should include the cost of local delivery from the port of entry to a warehouse, exact location TBD, within Almaty and Tashkent.  USAID will arrange for duty and tax-free customs clearance at ports of entry.  
 
Question 13: Is used equipment acceptable? 
Answer: No.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment #1 is to post questions and answers related to this procurement.

Question 1.  We have described variance between consumables for pipettes and tips. There is no 300ul tips specified for 50-300ul 8-ch. pipettor. Should we consider the specs of pipettor as 50-200ul. 

Answer: We need tips of ranges up to 300ul. The specification is changed from “Tips, STERILE, 20-200 ul - 1000/pk - 6” to “Tips, STERILE, 50ul (or less)—300ul – 1000/pk – 6”

Question 2.  Please clarify the type of microplate reader that is required.  In the last bid, there was a reader with on board software (in russian language, english, etc). You may recall that in our last bid, the spec called for a reader with on board software for data analysis.  One advantage was that the language choice included Russian.

In this bid, it doesn't specify whether the reader should be computer controlled or have on board software for use without a computer.  If it is intended for use with a computer, what type of software do you want.  For example, will you do curve fitting, what type, report types desired, etc.  What language should the software be in?  What kind of computer will it need to run on?  What type of printer will you use?  What file formats are required?  The software specification for microplate readers is much more complicated than the reader itself.

Perhaps you simply want to control the reader from Microsoft excel and capture the raw data.  Please let us know the details.  When responding to a bid such as this one, if you follow the letter of the bid, you will end up with a reader that cannot be used without a computer and the software required to control it, because the reader alone is the least expensive and that is all that the bid calls for.

Answer: On-board LCD, and ports for PC interface, and printer output; Windows-capable, with user-definable protocol; Software: Courve fits, and endpoint screening assay; Self-test; Manual and automatic plate layout, control and assay validation, cutoff criteria, data analysis; Lab technical and/or service manuals (operating instructions, installation, maintenance) in Russian. 

Question 3.   No capacity requirement is listed for the centrifuge do you have a minimum number of tubes that you would need?

Answer: Centrifuge must accommodate at least 6 tubes. 

 

Question 4.  The cylinders listed do not specify glass but I am assuming glass is needed?

Answer: Cylinders should NOT be glass.  They must be polystyrene or polymethylpentene.

<DESC>This notice is amended to delete all references to Glass and Quartz Filters.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC , has a requirement for Teflon Filters. The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM 2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal  2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.  The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of  raw materials for distribution.  It is important that all filters or the same type from the same delivery contain a uniform level of impurities.  Therefore, the contractor shall manufacture all filters for a delivery from the same sheet material using a single production line and one production run. EPA anticipates the award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity/Firm-Fixed Price/Performance Based Award Term contract.  The contract to be awarded as a result of full and open competition and the subject solicitation will contain a twelve (12)- month base period and four twelve (12) -month award term options.  The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty (60) months.  The Government intends to issue one delivery order annually for teflon filters  to cover the filter needs.   The minimum amount of teflon filters to be ordered is 200,000 in the base period and 100,000 each in Options I - IV.  The maximum amount of teflon filters to be ordered in the base period is 400,000 and 500,000 each in Options I-III. The maximum amount of teflon filters to be ordered in Option IV is 1,000,000.  Specifications and references for the teflon filters are outlined in the SOW for the previous contract which can be viewed at the acquisition planning website:  http://yosemite1.epa.gov/oarm/oam/forecastdatabase.nsf.  View Document Number 146.   As part of the solicitation requirements, the Government intends to require offerors to submit 50 teflon filters with their proposal.  These samples will be tested to ensure the offerors' capabilities to produce acceptable samples.  The procurement will be processed as a full and open competition.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is a follow-on to contract number 68D98028 with Whatman, Inc.  The RFP will be issued approximately 11/14/03 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  As previously stated the solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via the Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

Changes made to the uploaded model contract are shown in bold font.  The central paragraph of the OCI clause is revised as follows: “(i) The Government places the highest priority on protecting the integrity of the TCM Space and Network Segment acquisitions by precluding either segment from biasing the independent development of other’s design or by creating an unfair competitive advantage.  Contractors interested in competing for both the Space and Network Segment acquisitions shall submit OCI plans that prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the contractor’s judgment and provide unfair competitive advantages.  Contractors will address the scope and magnitude of work under consideration and the impacts of having the same division of a company work on both segments.  The TCM Network PRDA prime contractor shall submit an OCI risk mitigation plan addressing all prime or subcontractor activity that presents a potential or actual OCI as defined in FAR Subpart 9.505.  This restriction will permit subcontractors with essential expertise to assist in optimizing the TCM Network architecture in multiple segments while mitigating the potential for bias.”

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to provide The Aviation Into-plane Reimbursement (AIR) Card and Ship’s bunkers’ Easy Acquisition (SEA) Card programs with a single credit card facilitator.  These are programs in which the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) uses commercially available technology to provide credit card services to all Department of Defense and Federal Civilian agencies for the worldwide procurement of aviation and ships bunker fuel and related ancillary services at commercial airports and seaports.  Currently there are over 20,000 active cards and on average 20,000 transactions per month in upwards of 1000 locations.  The Government prefers to eliminate the need for Government Furnish Equipment in this program.  The AIR Card program works in conjunction with the well-established DESC Into-plane contract program.  The SEA Card program works similarly to the AIR Card program with some differences.  The AIR/SEA Card program management office designates one card per plane or vessel, each grouped under DESC designated Approving Officials (AO).  AOs are designated to assign responsibility for card usage and to reflect a unit’s hierarchical make-up.  The cards, training, billing, agreements with contracted vendors, hardware and software, record keeping, and coordination are all conducted by the card facilitator.   Card transactions are executed electronically, but may be completed manually, if required.  The purchases made are generally for fuel from a DESC contract, but non-contract local purchases are also charged to the card.  The card facilitator will split the invoice between the unit for ancillary purchases and DESC for fuel purchases.  The card facilitator shall be required to interface with DESC financial and other automated systems.  Occasionally the program contractor will act as the Government agent to establish agreements with foreign nations and or firms for the sale of fuel.  

This is a request for information only.  A draft solicitation shall be issued in November.  Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-8506) to Marlene Hines, no later than November 14, 2003. Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size, small business or small disadvantaged business status, 8(a) or HUB Zone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractor or (prime). Please specify any questions or concerns to the Contract Specialist for this action Marlene Hines via email.

A. Summary of Duties

The Senior Advisor for Local Government will perform the services specified herein. Such services shall be under the general policy guidance of the USAID Mission Director.  The contractor will work as a USAID/Croatia staff member and will take directions and report directly to the US DH Democracy and Governance Team Leader.  In this capacity, s/he will have first line management responsibility for two USAID-funded activities in support of democratic transition in Croatia with specific emphasis (but not limited to) the areas of local governance and media.  In addition, s/he will supervise two Croatian Project Specialists.  Activities are carried out at the national and local levels of government in Croatia.


B. Background

In 1996 Croatia’s local government sector increased five-fold to 567 local governments.  The 2002 fiscal and decentralization plan left nascent county and municipal administrations ill-prepared to assume the newly devolved authorities.  In response, USAID began a pilot local government program to assist local authorities with “best-practices” in financial and asset management, local economic development and citizen participation in local affairs.  In FY 2002, USAID designed a computerized financial management model that enables local governments to analyze their financial state.  A further intervention was a budget transparency process developed by USAID implementers.  The process includes public budget hearings; mayor's budget messages publicized through the local media; and “Budgets-In-Brief” to assist citizens to become involved in the budget process.  Cities have adopted asset management reforms introduced by USAID.  This has led to immediate results as local governments are now able to increase revenues from assets that had never been previously used for income.  

The Croatia Mission has just completed the design and tender for a new local government reform project that will build upon the best practices developed on the current project.  The goal of the new project is to continue dissemination of best practices developed on the first project and expand the project with additional public administration models including performance monitoring, policy dialogue and loan packaging.  This last area of technical assistance will be particularly important for enabling local governments to access municipal finance through the private capital market, multilateral lending institutions or host government facilities such as the regional development fund.  The policy dialogue will focus on new legislation and serve to consolidate gains made in the Croatian local government sector and reform the sector to conform to European Charter on Local Self Government and EU practices.

Reflecting this priority is the approximately $20 million local government reform project that will be set in place by January 2004.


C. Position Description 

The Senior Advisor for Local Government provides specialized technical assistance and serves as a project/grant manager within the USAID/Croatia Office of Democracy and Governance to ensure the timely and effective implementation of a portfolio of activities in support of the overall USAID/Croatia Democracy and Governance Strategy.   

Specific duties include, but are not limited to: supervision of two Croatian Project Specialists; drafting of issues papers, strategy papers, and project design documents; drafting of public information documents including press releases, data sheets, briefing papers and information packages; and overall monitoring of local government activities.  Development and management of annual and multi-year budgets for assigned activities; field monitoring, evaluation, and reporting on assigned activities; development and implementation of specific elements of the D/G program monitoring and evaluation plan, including identification of key progress indicators and collection of data; and contribution to USAID/Croatia annual and other regular reporting documents.  In addition, the Senior Advisor for Local Government will serve as Acting Team Leader in the absence of the US DH Democracy and Governance Team Leader.

As a Senior Advisor for Local Government, the selected individual will be responsible for all aspects of the Local Government contract management, including effective performance of contractors and identification and reporting on specific results and impact of USAID funded activities.

The D/G strategy for Croatia is focused on achievement of one Strategic Objective (SO):    
"More Effective Citizen Participation and Improved Governance". In FY04, it is projected that the Local Government Reform Project II will account for approximately 16% of the value of the yearly USAID/Croatia portfolio and will reach 25% in FY05.

The entire D/G portfolio currently includes specific project activities in the areas of non-governmental organization (NGO) sector development, independent media, local government strengthening, political party building, civil society development, rule of law, and training.  In addition, the Office of Democracy Governance provides technical assistance, analysis and advice on issues related to strengthening NGOs and improving governance systems for three other strategic objective teams (SOs).  The Senior Advisor for Local Government will participate in all activities within the SO.

The Senior Advisor for Local Government will be an integral member of the D/G Strategic Objective Team, including serving as Acting Team Leader when necessary, and will work closely with other American and Foreign Service national D/G project specialists.  As a team member, s/he will be required to contribute to training of other team members on USAID systems.  Knowledge of USAID reporting is essential.  Within the Strategic Objective Team, the Senior Advisor for Local Government may be requested to provide management and/or technical backstopping for any and all projects in the D/G program portfolio and therefore, as much as possible, keep up to date on the results of the D/G Team’s activities.

<DESC>The 45 Space Wing issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the possible acquisition of atmospheric gas analysis services.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited.  The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with the processing separation and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification.  Definition of some terms: bottle = 900cc steel container filled with whole air constituents requiring processing for analysis; sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate selected atmospheric radioactive effluent gasses of interest for analysis.  Gas analysis requires the ability to:  (a) be proficient with various radioactive gas counting techniques; (b) determine, prior to separation, the percent of oxygen and nitrogen and the volume (in cubic centimeters) of other selected effluent gases within sample bottles; (c) separate selected radioactive effluent gases, as required, from cryogenic arid whole air samples; (d) radioassay separated samples; and (e) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required.  Requests for these analyses may occur with little notice and may require 8 hour to 24-hour analysis capability.  Other requirements include:  (a) In the event the government elects to procure atmospheric gas analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will he performed), prior to performance start; (b) Offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements.  Unique analysis equipment essential to the mission will be provided, with ownership retained by the government.  Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment, and areas of any facility used for gas analysis services, shall not be used for activities other than government work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) Prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  A firm-fixed-price contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options.  Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$6.0 million.  No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time.  Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 30 days from the date of publication.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above.  The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-AskED2004
<RESPDATE>121003
<ARCHDATE>12252003
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being submitted for any and all educated and experienced vendors who are capable of providing advice, strategies and development proposals to assist us in creating our next statement of work for the Phase II development of Ask ED.  Competition for this Phase II development will begin before February 2004.  White paper responses should be no more than 4 pages, not including attachments.  Please provide (as an attachment not to exceed more than 3 pages) short summaries of like work completed or in progress and price. Please label all proprietary data.  Attachments about the system's current state have been provided (Most "To-Be" items, if not determined to be in Phase II or III have been completed).  The below Phase II section is an accurate account of what will be our Phase II development, not what is listed in the attachments prepared by Digicon, the system's original developer.   All responses should be in writing and can be e-mailed to anya.smith@ed.gov or mailed Attn:  Anya Smith, OIIA/Community Services Team, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW,  Room 5E103, Washington, DC 20202.  If you need further information about the tool, please contact Anya Smith at anya.smith@ed.gov.  BACKGROUND - The Department of Education answers more than 20,000 questions a week – via telephone, fax, letter and email - from the public and from internal users. No one point of contact has all the answers. Currently, the Department has a web-based referral tool developed in Cold Fusion® and Microsoft SQL Server entitled Ask ED Customer Referral Tool which was built to address these needs—Ask ED incorporates the variety of tools and notes used by the staff to be the prime resource in the Department to obtain and share universal information.  This tool allows all ED employees a technological solution to help them make referrals more rapidly, accurately and conveniently.  The first phase of Ask ED was released for internal use in January 2003. It resides on ED's Intranet site (connectED) and can be accessed by all those with rights to access connectED.  At present, Ask ED is going through a system upgrade, which will allow migration of a current Lotus Notes database tool (The U.S. Guide to ED Programs) to be migrated with the Ask ED database to create a shared database with different front-end looks and functionalities.  Additional fields, security levels and data-entry screening procedures will be incorporated into the upgraded system prior to Phase II development.  This development should be 85% complete by February 2004.  PHASE II NEEDS - Ask ED's general focus is to help anyone in the agency that receives a customer contact, quick and reliable access to the proper office, person and on occasion a standard answer, to their request.  In Phase II development, we are looking to create a secure and 508 compliant system that 1) expands the current Principal Office Contact (POC) and Program Information, FAQ, Resources, search/ask-a-question features currently on Ask ED to www.ed.gov.  The Internet version of Ask ED will be focused more on answers than referral responses.  2) Creation of an Ask ED Internet homepage on ed.gov with an Ask-A functionality. 3) Migration of the agency's Employee Locator database (currently in Lotus Notes and available on connectED and www.ed.gov) to be an option on the Ask ED websites both on the Inter and Intranet sites.  4) Improvement of the current search functionality to improve results.  CREATION OF ASK-A FUNCTION - The Ask-A functionality will be beneficial in addressing the agency's large influx of e-mail traffic, as well as allow ED's customer an opportunity to "self serve" when seeking answers to their ED-related questions.  We are seeking feedback on the most economical and efficient manner to do this.  See www.ba.com (British Airways) Ask-A function.  Something to this effect is in our line of thinking for achieving our needs for in this area; however, we are completely open to other suggestions.  The key issues we are considering:  1) Give customers several options to get to the same information.  I.e. Use the A-Z topics to house the answers to any question or key word that may be entered in the general search field. 2) Allow the end user easy access to an e-mail form with drop down topics to categorize the subject matter.  This would ensure that the appropriate program office receives the request if a "canned" answer is not available.  This e-mail system should be able to track the path in which the customer takes prior to sending an e-mail and track the final email subject, as well as disseminate the e-mail to the predetermined subject matter office/person.  3) Automated follow up e-mail messages to be scheduled for send out from the system, which will contact the original customer to verify whether they received assistance.  Questions:  What else should we consider when developing an Ask-A option and e-mail tracking and dissemination system?  What other functions may be useful?  Are there off-the-shelf options available to address our needs?  When addressing this issue please package a response with high, low and med range solutions with cost estimates.  REVISAL OF CURRENT SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY - Ask ED does searches similar to askjeeves.com, as well as has advance search capabilities for words and phrases.  We would like to "fine-tune" the database's search capabilities to improve the accuracy of the results and/or be able to drive the more likely results to the top of the results listing (see figures 9 and 10 of the document FRD_1.2_FINAL_As_Built_Erin).  QUESTIONS:  From our current search design, is there anyway we can improve the search result rankings?

<DESC>In the summer of 2004, the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station will be hosting “Niagara Airshow” 2004.  This free yearly event attracts nearly 100,000 local citizens for the weekend.  We invite the public to see the latest in military and civilian aviation along with other military and corporate displays.  Along with the activities in the air, families will be able to walk through all of our aircraft displays, ride simulators, listen to music provided by military bands, and enjoy other various ground attractions.  
	The Base’s airshow is free to the public.  We pride ourselves on this.  The only groups that profit from our airshow are the nonprofit organizations that staff our concessionaire booths.  This permits them to raise money for their organizations.  
	Since this is a free community event, we ask corporations to help sponsor this event.  By participating as a corporate sponsor, there are many benefits:

Sponsor’s logo on airshow publicity materials
Sponsor may hang banners on airshow grounds
Space provided for sponsor company’s product
Opportunity for sponsor to conduct product sampling
Many other opportunities are available too.

	The purpose of the “Niagara Airshow” is to recruit people for the military and to provide goodwill to the local community.  Therefore, it would be to your company’s advantage in participating as an airshow sponsor.  In addition, your company will be able to advertise your product in front of 100,000 people for the weekend.  Also, your company will be working with a very professional airshow staff and will accommodate your company’s request in any way.
	For more information about the “Niagara Airshow”, please contact Mr. Jerry Slipko, Services Marketing Director at 716-236-3061 or jerry.slipko@niagarafalls.af.mil.  As soon as we hear from you, we will provide you more specific information on the exciting opportunities available to you.  We look forward to your reply.

Therefore, it is the Bureau's belief that The Center for Geotechnical Practice and Research at Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University is the only source capable in providing the supplies and services based on the facts above.  This is not a formal solicitation.  However, concerns that respond shall provide detailed data concerning their capabilities and may request to receive a copy of the solicitation when, and if it becomes available.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
 
Solicitation Number: CDC115-03-019.  
 
This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 15 (08/25/03).  The proposed procurement will be conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Subpart 13.5. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 and the small business size standard in number of employees 1,000. This solicitation is being conducted under full and open competition, however all things being equal, preference will be given to U.S. small businesses. Please indicate your business status on your response. The following FAR and AIDAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 (Jul 2003); FAR 52.212-2 (Jan 1999) (see evaluation factors below); FAR 52.212-3 (Jun 2003); FAR 52.212-4 (Feb 2002); FAR 52.212-5 (Jun 2003), and AIDAR 752.7000. An offer should include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.  
 
PURPOSE:  CDC/CAR intends to procure a complete set of serology laboratory equipment, and associated start-up supplies.  Each laboratory will consist of the following: Automated Microplate Reader, Automated Microplate Washer, Incubator, Centrifuge for Serum Separation, Pipettors and appropriate consumables.  35 sets of equipment will be provided to national and district-level laboratories in Central Asia. The provision of this laboratory equipment is part of a larger program aimed at strengthening the disease surveillance capacity of the Central Asian countries. Other components of the overall initiative include laboratory training and quality control system development.  The equipment will be used to test serum samples for viral agents such as, at a minimum, HIV, and Hepatitis B and C. Individual laboratories will likely eventually use the equipment for other applications, but they are not within the scope of the current program and hence should not be a factor in equipment selection.  The equipment is to be located in laboratory spaces which will be specified and provided by the Ministries of Health in each of the Central Asian Republics, at the national or district level. The list of equipment for each of the 35 labs, with minimum required technical specifications will be provided upon request.  
 
Offers shall provide:
1. Unit price based on quantity for 35 laboratories;
2. Brand and model names and technical descriptions; Manufacturer part or catalog number;
3. Full text of warranty, including explicit statement of applicability in Central Asia Republics; name, address, telephone and e-mail contact of warranty-service provider in Central Asia Republics. 
4. Price for shipping equipment to American Embassy, Almaty, Kazakhstan (4 sets), American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan (19 sets), American Embassy, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (6 sets), American Embassy, Dushanbe, Tajikistan (5 sets) and American Embassy, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, (1 set) quoted both for shipment via air freight, and via surface.  Delivery is due within 90 days from the effective date of award. 
5. Provision of laboratory technical and/or service manuals (operating instructions, installation, maintenance) as appropriate in Russian language.
6. Description of terms, conditions, and procedures for obtaining spare or replacement parts for equipment provided, both during and after the period of warranty.
7. The contractor will train 2 (two) resident nationals from Central Asia in the appropriate installation, use and maintenance of the laboratory equipment. Trainees will be designated by the CDC/CAR. The quote should provide the price for training of 2 persons and a description of the training content. The contractor should identify the training location (US or overseas) depending on the location of training facilities. Transportation and per diem expenses for participants will be paid separately by USAID/CAR. Training should be completed within 60 days from the effective date of award. 
8. Previous experience in the provision of similar or related equipment to international organizations or agencies of the US Government, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Department, and the Food and Drug Administration. 
9.  Origin (country of manufacture) of each product.   The Authorized Geographic Codes for this contract are 000 (United States) and 110 (independent countries of the former Soviet Union).   If a 000 or 110-origin product is not available, the offeror  must provide an explanation and request a waiver in accordance with 22CFR228.51.  
 
Order will be placed on or before October 29, 2003. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions. Therefore the initial offer must contain and meet all the Government specifications and requirements. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines discussions are necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The award decision will be based upon, in descending order of importance, price, technical compliance and quality, warranty terms and past performance. The Government's preference is to award one contract for all items. However, the Government may determine it is more advantageous to place separate orders for line items where there is a significant cost savings available on one or more items. 
Offers are due at 10 AM, Almaty time on September 29, 2003. They must be addressed to the Contracting Officer, USAID/CAR, c/o American Embassy, 99/97A Furmanov Street,  Almaty 480091, Kazakhstan. Facsimile proposals may be submitted to 7 3272 507635 or 507636. E-mailed offers may be sent to jlord@usaid.gov and nportnyagian@usaid.gov.  All quotes must be in writing, dated and signed by an authorized representative and reference RFQ No. CDC115-03-019. Questions should be addressed to nportnyagina@usaid.gov or 7 3272 507612 X290.

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall be considered as time excluded under clause III(m)(3).


ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.





ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: DEMURRAGE DOCUMENTATION.  In the event of demurrage, all supporting documents as identified in TANKVOY III(d) (3) Invoices, shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage invoices. After receiving the Contracting Officer's concurrence, Owner may submit demurrage invoices (with the DD Form 250-1) to the office identified in Box 18b of SF 1449.

MODIFY: II – Incorporate revised clause 52.212-4 (Oct 2003).  Tailored language still applies. 

MODIFY: III(p) – add new sentence at the end of subparagraph (1): “The United States of America shall be named as an additional Assured Party with waiver of subrogation on all applicable insurance policies.”
