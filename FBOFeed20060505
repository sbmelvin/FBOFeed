<CONTACT>Lorrie Gleghorn Contracting Officer 5032312392     Lorrie_Gleghorn@fws.gov;
<DESC>Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contract on as as-needed basis to furnish all labor, services, equipment, materials, and supplies for Land Surveys in support of U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service resource management programs in Region 1, the States of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California, Nevada, and Hawaii.  This support includes: boundary, topographic, control, and water rights surveying, which may involve research, field work, mapping, preparation of legal descriptions and tract reports, preparation and processing of tentative maps and applications for land division approval, calculation of volumes and quantities, recording of surveys, plats and monument records. The Service intends to award one to two contracts in each of twelve geographic zones, see Exhibit.  Geographic Zones have been identified within five of the six states covered by this contract.  The zones are delineated by county boundaries, and have been designed to include both major concentrations of USFWS facilities and the nearest urban areas.  In this way, it is expected that the costs of per diem and travel are minimized and local experience is maximized, while creating a large competitive pool. Contractors must have a survey office located within the zone for which they wish to be considered.  A survey office is an office from which survey crews are ordinarily dispatched by the Land Surveyor in responsible charge of the work being performed.  This requirement does not prevent the contractor from utilizing crews and resources from other offices for any projects allocated under this contract.  One firm may be awarded a contract in more than one zone, but the contractor is required is required to maintain a survey office within the zone(s) for which they are selected. Projects located within the zone will be assigned to the contractor for that geographic zone (if the zone has two contract awards then the projects will rotate between them).  If the need arises, Work outside the designated zones will be assigned to a contractor based on certain qualifying factors, as determined by the Service.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source follow-on contract with Cerner Corporation to augment research, data collection and other related activities among a cohort of HIV –infected persons receiving care at 15 HIV –specialty ambulatory clinics in several United States cities.  The anticipated performance period is five years.  The contractor will be required to continue to collect and assure the quality of data collected from HIV care sites—notably, the patients’ demographics, social and behavioral characteristics, physical signs and symptoms, medical diagnoses, treatments, laboratory values, and will propose and execute at least two sub-studies within the framework of such data collection.  The sub-studies shall include clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory, and social-behavioral issues in HIV infection.  Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks in this project:   

TASK 1: Data Abstraction and Entry from 15 study-sites treating HIV –infected adult patients (at least 75 patients per study site per year).  The Contractor shall collect and assure the quality of data collected from the HIV study sites within the data management system.  These activities shall include database entry of patient visit information within the study sites’ protocol and patient consent.  

TASK 2:  The data shall be entered into the Clinical Practice Analyst (CPA), and the contractor shall provide technical support for the CPA and modify the software as requested by CDC.  

TASK 3:  Provide and assure the completeness and accuracy of data by data-management training for on-site personnel to each study site and site visit to assure the timely, complete and accurate addition of data to the overall database; and ongoing quality assurance-driven data management.  


TASK 4:  The Contractor shall ensure all study sites maintain their local IRB approvals with annual renewals.  All approvals and final clearances (CDC and local IRB’s, FWA’s and other applicable requirements) must be obtained for the protocol acquired under TASK 1 above.  

TASK 5: Conduct and execute at least two sub-studies relevant to the prevention and treatment of HIV infection within the cohort of enrolled patients to address issues that emerge during the course of the study and as a result of the evolving knowledge about HIV/AIDS. These issues may include mortality and morbidity of HIV infection in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), treatment and prevention of opportunistic illnesses, and the treatment and prevention of complications related to the use of HAART and attendant longer survival.  The sub-studies shall include clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory and social-behavioral issues in HIV infection

TASK 6:  Organize and execute a two-day annual meeting for this project.  Participants will include CDC staff, Contractor’s staff, investigators, and others from study sites.

TASK 7:   The Contactor shall provide statistical support for at least eight new and separate scientific analyses of the data.  Analyses will be conducted in consultation with and under the guidance of CDC.  All presentations and publications from data analyses under the contract will be restricted. 

Cerner Corporation’s long-term experience with this study will help ensure the most efficient implementation of this project for the following reasons:

a)	Cerner Corporation has worked on this project for 13 years and is already intimately familiar with the study sites, agency’s requirements, and past and ongoing information on the “existing” cohort of patients.
b)	Cerner Corporation‘s past participation and continued partnerships are critical for resolving ongoing resolutions and/or remediation.
c)	Time constraints imposed by CDC for target patients’ group data, publications, site monitoring and reporting, require Cerner Corporation’s continued work on this project.  Cerner Corporation’s experience and history with the project will ensure timely reporting and meeting CDC’s requirements. 

It is critical to the study to continue to collect longitudinal, ongoing information on the “existing” cohort of patients from the original source than to any other source which would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling CDC’s requirement.  Hence, a follow-on contract with Cerner Corporation would be the most efficient and cost effective way to deliver services that are critical and essential to meet CDC’s requirement.   CDC intends to negotiate this requirement with Cerner Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, HHSAR 306.302-1, and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  Any other responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.  Responses must be received on May 16, 2006, at 4 PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Betty Vannoy at bbv9@cdc.gov.  Questions concerning this proposed acquisition may be directed to Betty Vannoy, Contract Specialist.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Market Survey Capability Assessment Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) Web-Based Application Tool (ASAP/WBAT) Support The FAA intends to award a contract for technical support services, including management, materials, and travel, to continue the design, development, implementation, operations, deployment, assessment, sustainment, and evolution of a secure, web-based data acquisition and information management system for ASAP participants, referred to as the ASAP Web-Based Application Tool (ASAP/WBAT). The proof-of-concept IFQASys ASAP effort and lessons learned form the basis for this solicitation and serve as the foundation for WBAT. This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.   A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to solicit comments from potential offerors.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that believe that they are able to perform the specific services outlined in the draft SOW and as specifically identified in the Task Order.  Background:   In order to maintain a high level of aviation safety, the FAA has established several voluntary partnership programs under which various operators and their employees can self-report safety concerns and events. Among these programs, one of the most important is the ASAP. The information collected by this program is used by ASAP participating Part 121 and 135 air carriers, fractional operator programs, repair stations, manufacturers, airport authorities, and the FAA to identify and correct individual employee, individual operators, industry wide safety, and National Airspace System (NAS) issues. The ASAP enhances safety by providing better insight into operations in order to identify potential precursors to incidents and accidents and to mitigate the associated risk.  Under the ASAP, the FAA provides enforcement related incentives (administrative action in lieu of legal enforcement action) for employee self-reporting of violations. Since 1991, over 47 ASAP Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) have been established with Part 121 and Part 135 certificate holders, and over 100,000 ASAP reports have been submitted by airline flight crews, flight attendants, dispatchers, and maintenance and engineering employees. ASAP reports provide insights into the causality of adverse safety events and allow individual air carriers to identify and correct their own safety problems. Since 80% of the ASAP reports are sole source, the ASAP allows the FAA to obtain safety information not available through traditional FAA oversight. The policy guidance provided in the ASAP Advisory Circular (AC 120-66B) specifies that the ASAP Event Review Committee (ERC) must maintain a database of all reports submitted and the disposition of those reports. To that end, a proof-of-concept version of the Integrated Flight Quality Analysis System (IFQASys) for ASAP was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of a web-based application to support this database requirement for interested participants in the FAA's ASAP. Currently, six airlines are using IFQASys ASAP for submission, management, and analysis of their ASAP reports to facilitate early discovery of operational safety and high risk issues that need to be addressed before they lead to incidents and accident. IFQASys ASAP also provides tools to manage the processing and disposition of submitted reports and their transformation into a database repository. By providing a consistent data formats, naming standards, categorization taxonomies, and exchange protocols, IFQASys ASAP has the potential to facilitate information sharing between carriers in order to identify industry wide problems that cannot be solved at the local level.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Upstate New York Service Center, anticipates modifying existing Contract GS02P96CTC0045 with LB&B Associates Inc. for mechanical maintenance services to extend the period of performance for 2 months beginning 1 July 06.  The noncompetitive extension is to provide the continuity of services.  The inability to complete this work would cause a major disruption to every tenant agency and would quickly require closure of the entire building.  Continuity considerations preclude the use of another contractor for preventive maintenance work that is already well underway or nearing completion.  No solicitation document will be issued for the extension.  The follow-on mechanical maintenance services acquisition plan is currently in progress. GSA intends to issue a competitive solicitation via GSA ADVANTAGE to FSS schedule holders under NAICS category 811002 in June 06.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)  intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Dr. William W. Lowrance, 72 Rue DE St Jean CW-1201, Geneva, Switzerland, to continue the service to provide expert consultant to the NHGRI.  The services required will investigate the issues surrounding de-identification of genotype/phenotype data and to develop a “white paper” for discussion at one or more workshops to be convened by NHGRI and/or others.  This project is a continuation of an initial consultation by the contractor for NHGRI staff regarding issues of participant privacy and de-identification of genotype/phenotype data as it relates to several on-going NHGRI initiatives.  The Statement of work (SOW) is as follows:  Background:  The National Human Genome Research Institute is involved in two NIH projects regarding whole genome association studies - The Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) and the Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI).  Both GAIN and GEI plan to supply genotyping services for selected whole genome association studies.  In the interest of open access, the projects are contemplating making genotype and phenotype information available on the internet (with phenotype information available through a limited access mechanism).  This open access strategy has raised concerns, including regarding participant privacy, from several NIH Institutes and individuals; therefore, NHGRI would like to investigate the issues surrounding de-identification of genotype/phenotype data.  Task #1)  Gather data surrounding de-identification of genotype/phenotype data through literature research, interviews with subject experts (both NIH staff and external experts), and other methodologies.  Task #2)  Develop a white paper (informational document) outlining the current issues surrounding de-identification of genotype/phenotype data.  The white paper should address the following questions at minimum and explore policy options regarding them:  What is the current practice of de-identification of genotype/phenotype data?   How does genomic/genetic data fit with HIPAA and other regulatory and legal requirements?  Should genomic/genetic data be treated as overt identifying information?  What is the status of DNA or other material as “personal data” or “protected health information” under law?  What methods are currently used to render data (of any sort) as not identifiable to researchers?  Based on expert interviews, how does the community think de-identification should be handled?  What policies should be put in place to both protect human subjects and advance human health/medicine/science?  How do the practices/laws of other nations affect this U.S.-based, international resource?.  Task #3)  Formulate and facilitate a series of workshops planned to gather public comment on the subject.  The white paper will be used as the basis for discussion.  Invitees will be comprised of experts in the field.  Task #4)  After the workshops, the contractor will be charged with summarizing the information gathered into a report for use by the NHGRI leadership.  The data gathered through this task will assist the NHGRI/NIH in developing future policies and procedures in this arena.  The period of performance is for Seven (7) months beginning on May 25, 2006 through November 25, 2006.  The place of performance is at NIH, Bethesda Maryland.  The sole source determination is based upon the need to continue to investigate the issues surrounding de-identification of Genotype/Phenotype data initiated by Dr. William W. Lowrance.  An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures.  It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable simplified acquisition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541690, Size Standard $6 million dollars.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, submit a statement of interest which includes a firm fixed price; documentation of similar projects conducted and the benefits in obtaining the Government’s objectives; at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government’s minimum requirements, a proposed delivery plan and the following technical evaluation criteria: 1) Demonstrated knowledge and understanding of the SOW as specified in this synopsis, 2) Demonstrate that the person performing this job to have: experience on the related field of this project, a Ph.D. from an accredited University in the biological field, Demonstrate a minimum of five (5) years of experience on Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) and the Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI) studies; and past performance.  The submission will be evaluated on the above documents.  The submission is due on May 20, 2006.    The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUN’s), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offerors Business size.  The Offeror must also register in the Government’s Contractor Registry System. Note: “http://www.ccr.gov.”  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Acquisition of Roche Light cycler 480 PCR System a device for Real time/quantitative PCR in a 96 or 384 multi-well platforms

Purpose/Brief History:

The Lab of Pathology at the NCI has a need to upgrade its current PCR system to the newest real time/quantative system available which is the Roche Light Cycler 480 System.  Projects involve identifying small changes in gene expression (less than 50% difference).  This requires complete consistency of temperature across the whole test platform during the amplification process.  The Roche Light Cycler 480 patented system can provide uniform well temperature across the entire platform.  This system is by far the fastest real-time PCR machine currently on the market.  It cuts down on the amplification time from 3 to less than an hour thus increasing productivity.  The Lab of Pathology often has to switch between 96 well and 384 well plates.  The Light Cycler 480 is the only machine that can switch between 96 or 384 well test platform in minutes without additional calibration time.  

The Roche Light Cycler 480 PCR System uses a patented technology called Therma-Base to insure well-to-well temperature homogeneity unmatched by any other system.  Therma-Base overcomes the “spreading resistance” phenomenon that results in non-homogeneous temperature control across all other block based real-time PCR systems.  The use of this technology for real-time PCR is unique to Roche and has been exclusively licensed and a use patent has been filed.  Research involves identifying small (less than 50%) changes in gene expression.  The Light Cycler 480 is able to provide the most accurate temperature control which will minimize the error due to amplification conditions and give a more accurate representation of the real m-RNA level in each sample tested.  This will increase the accuracy and sensitivity of the experimental determinations.  

The Light Cycler 480 system is the only system that allows 96-well and 384 well test blocks to be switched in less than 5 minutes with no further warm-up or equilibration time.  Further the system is ready for use as soon as the swap is completed without any lengthy calibration steps.  The lab has to switch between 96-well and 384-well test platforms often depending on the number of samples and repeats it needs for each experiment.  The Light Cycler 480 is the only machine that allows such switches in minutes and requires no additional calibration time.  This will increase the efficiency by allowing the lab to perform multiple tests in one day without regard to the test platform used.

The Light Cycle 480 system is the only real-time PCR system that can perform 30 cycle, 384-well runs in less than 40 minutes with 96-well runs requiring less than 1 hour.  The current system requires 3 hours for each run.  This will increase productivity by allowing the lab to  test more samples in one work day.

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

As stated above Roche Diagnostic Inc is the only manufacturer of such an instrument (Light Cycler 480 System) that can insure well-to-well temperature homogeneity via the patented Therma-Based technology.  The Roche Light cycler 480 system is also the only one that allows 96-well and 384-well platform interchangeability in minutes with no need for extensive recalibration and the Roche Light Cycler 480 is the only real-time PCR system that can perform 30 cycle amplification in under an hour.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This requirement is for the Decommissioning of three obsolete RADIAC calibrators currently located at US Army Radiation Standards Laboratory, R edstone Arsenal, AL. The calibrators can no longer be used to calibrate RADIAC instrumentation because the sources loaded in them are took weak, and the instruments they were used to calibrate have been replaced by state-of-the-art models which require a c onfiguration for calibration no obtainable using these calibrators. Decommissioning of the calibrators includes disposal of the radioactive sources, removing the possibility that they could be the target of the terrorist element effort to use them in weapo ns of mass destruction. J.L. Shepherd is the only contractor known to possess the expertise and experience with these calibrators (all three were manufactured by Shepherd) to provide the requested services. Shepherd is also the only contractor known to hav e the appropriate Nuclear Regulatory Commission license required to perform the requested services.

<DESC>Predicting Health and Disease (PHD) SOL BAA 06-19, Addendum 4, DUE: June 22, 2006 (white papers)/August 21, 2006 (full proposals) TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4674, Email: baa06-19@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/ 



DESCRIPTION

The Defense Sciences Office is seeking proposals for the new Predicting Health and Disease (PHD) program. In the civilian community, if a person becomes ill they are able to call in sick. This does not hold true for military operations, in which missions depend on the ability each member of a team to perform at peak performance. The PHD program will develop methods to assess whether an individual will develop an infectious disease, prior to the onset of disease symptoms. Such a capability will allow for early preventative treatment and/or infection control, and allow potential adjustments to critical mission profiles thus significantly increasing the probability of a successful operation.

Current methods are reasonably capable of diagnosing a specific infectious disease after the onset of a patient’s symptoms. The PHD program seeks to alter this paradigm by identifying changes in the baseline state of human health that indicate the onset of disease prior to typically manifested signs and symptoms. Achieving this will require a multi-disciplinary approach to diagnostics that includes, at the minimum, innovative data analytic methodologies coupled with traditional and non-traditional medical diagnostic parameters. DARPA’s end goal is to create the technological breakthroughs required for the development of a field portable, point of care health assessment system. Such a system must be able to handle large throughput (one hundred or more analyses), in short time spans (under a three hour turn around), at low costs. 

BACKGROUND

We are soliciting approaches that address the following challenge problem: 

The basal state of a human is the state of “health.” After encountering a pathogen at time t = 0, the host-response to the pathogen causes a set of symptoms to emerge. The appearance of these symptoms occurs at time t*. Using existing or novel techniques, detect the transition from the state healthy to the state “ill” prior to the onset of symptoms at ft* where f << 1. As f approaches 1, models should become more predictive, with Pd (probability of detection) approaching 1, and Pfa (probability of false alarm or false positive) approaching 0. We seek general methods that are applicable to multiple infectious agents.

PHD is envisioned as a two-phase program with an optional third-phase. The first phase will consist of development of a diagnostic method and supporting analysis. Successful efforts will find solutions to the challenge problem that meet an accuracy level of Pd = .7 and Pfa = .05 at f = .1 and Pd = .95 and Pfa = .01 at f = .8. Authors of the proposals should be aware that meeting the Phase 1 goal is one determining factor in the decision to proceed to Phase 2. Prior to Phase 2, there may be a down selection of performers. The second phase will consist of refinement of the model to an accuracy level of Pd = .9 and Pfa = .01 at f = .1 and Pd = .99 and Pfa = .001 at f = .8. Programs that are successful in the second phase may enter an optional third phase. This optional phase will support the final research and development of any new devices or technologies used in the model for submission for FDA approval. 

Proposals should detail aggressive timelines to meeting these milestones. Timelines must include a clear path to reaching the goals of Phase 1 and Phase 2. Successful proposals will establish expeditious means for addressing the viability of their methodology.  Phases will be limited to twelve months. However, proposals with phases longer than twelve months will be accepted but only with appropriate justification

Research efforts should address the following areas in developing the model. We are only interested in research in these areas as a pathway to attaining the milestones and are not interested in exploration of these areas in isolation.

1.	Pathogens of interest: We are mainly interested in viral, upper respiratory pathogens that have the potential for decreasing warfighter mission readiness, and occasionally result in aborted missions and significant warfighter morbidity. Pathogens of interest include influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and other similar viruses. 
2.	A data collection effort that assesses biometric data at multiple points pre- and post-exposure. We are interested in a wide range of sources for this data, including traditional, non-traditional, and entirely novel parameters. 
3.	Mathematical methods and analysis tools to determine the signatures that predict the transition from the basal state to the final state
4.	Robust descriptions of virus/host interactions through multiple phases of disease that improve our understanding of this dynamic host: pathogen system.
5.	Generation of a baseline model of health that must acknowledge the demographic composition of the American warfighter. 
6.	Intra-individual and inter-individual variability: reduction of false positives by such mechanisms as greater understanding of cell-mediated host immunity and stress responses. 


In addition, proposed models should be applicable to multiple disease agents. An approach that will only work for a single disease is not of as much interest as a universal approach. DARPA is not interested in proposals which focus solely on pathogen based diagnostics, for example, viral PCR



PROPOSAL PROCESS

We anticipate a two stage source selection. It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED that a white paper be submitted according to the guidelines provided below. 

White Paper and Full Proposal Deadlines

White papers will be accepted until June 22, 2006 NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM ET. All white papers will be reviewed no later than July 21, 2006 and recommendations for full proposals will be provided at that time. Full proposals will be due August 21, 2006 NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM ET. White papers and proposals submitted by fax will not be accepted. All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper. Note that a full proposal may be submitted at anytime before the close of the solicitation without having submitted a white paper.

White Paper Submission Guidelines

White papers of eight pages or less will be reviewed for the purpose of recommending the submission of full proposals. The white paper must include the following sections:


1.	An executive summary. A clear statement of the uniqueness of the idea. We are looking for ideas that will revolutionize the field of diagnostics if the proposed work is successfully completed. 
2.	A concise statement of the approach to the problem, the scientific and technical challenges inherent in this approach, and possible solutions for overcoming potential problems. This statement will also serve to demonstrate an understanding of the state-of-the-art in the field.
3.	A first-order analysis of the changes in diagnostic models necessary to achieve this approach both in terms of analysis and collection of data and the source of measurement of biologic change. 
4.	Timelines and milestone achievements by which progress can be measured. These timelines and milestones should be as detailed as possible. Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics. 
5.	A notional means of deploying this methodology in an active and deployed warfighter force. 
6.	A detailed cost estimate for resources over the proposed timeline. This cost estimate should include both labor and materials costs. 
7.	A summary of expertise of the key personnel on the project relevant to the challenge problem. If the team is multi-organizational, a proposed management structure should also be included. 
8.	Brief list of relevant references


Full Proposal Guidelines

Guidelines for full proposal submission can be found in BAA06-19 (http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa06-19pt2.html). The technical sections of the full proposal must include:

1.	An executive summary. A clear statement of the uniqueness of the idea. We are looking for ideas that will revolutionize the field of diagnostics if the proposed work is successfully completed. 
2.	A detailed description of the approach to the problem, the scientific and technical challenges inherent in this approach, and possible solutions for overcoming potential problems. This description will also serve to demonstrate an understanding of the state-of-the-art in the field.
3.	A comprehensive analysis of the changes in diagnostic approach both in terms of analysis and collection of data and the source of measurement for biological change.
4.	Timelines and milestone achievements by which progress can be measured. These timelines and milestones should be as detailed as possible. Milestones must be associated with demonstrable metrics. 
5.	A description of implementation of the proposed approach in the warfighter community that addresses the challenges of an active deployed force. 
6.	A detailed cost estimate for resources over the proposed timeline. This cost estimate should include both labor and materials costs. 
7.	A detailed overview of expertise of the key personnel on the project relevant to the challenge problem. If the team is multi-organizational, a proposed management structure should also be included. 
8.	Brief list of relevant references



In addition, all proposals should be supplemented by a one page Quad chart describing the program objectives, relevance to the military population, performers, technical milestones, and Fiscal Year total budget. This quad chart will not count against total page count.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the website link to the previous solicitation notice.  Please see the correct link below.

THIS IS A COPY OF A LETTER SENT TO FIRMS WHICH PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED TO RFI DCCA-060024.  OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE INVITED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.


Dear Sir or Madam:


Thank you for your interest in NSF Sources Sought Notice DCCA-060024, Ice-Breaking Services in Antarctica.  This Request for Information (RFI) is on the internet and may be viewed at:

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/NSF/DCCA/CPO/DCCA%2D060024/listing.html

Your input will help inform our discussions regarding the future of the U.S. polar icebreaking fleet.  In parallel, the National Academies of Science has constituted a special committee to review this issue and provide advice to the Government.  The website for that review may be viewed at:

http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=173

The RFI you responded to concerned icebreaking services.  Based on information gained from wide-ranging discussions on this topic, NSF now sees merit in seeking information concerning a complete re-supply package – for example, mated icebreakers and cargo/fuel supply vessels that can work in close tow configuration.  We may issue an RFI to that end but in the meantime, we invite your expression of interest in providing one or more aspects of such a system, and/or expressions of interest for teaming arrangements to implement such a system.

The package should include icebreaking with delivery of fuel, containers and break bulk to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, as well as the retrograde of materials from McMurdo Station to the U.S.  The nominal annual requirements are identified below and in the attached spread sheets. 

•	Fuel (gallons)
o	AN-8 3.5 million
o	JP-5 3.0 million
o	Gasoline 250 thousand

•	Containers (TEU): 600

•	Break Bulk (Pounds): 1.5 million

•	Retrograde
o	500 TEU
o	500,000 lbs break bulk

We would appreciate receiving responses by 4:00 PM on June 30, 2006.  However, we should advise you that we are seeking information only.  At present, we have not determined when, or if, we will seek these services.


Sincerely,						
						
Original Signed
						
Jillian M. Pate
Contracting Officer

<DESC>Title 49, United States Code, Chapter 443, authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide insurance and issue or procure reinsurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of American aircraft of foreign flag aircraft. Provision of such insurance is subject to several criteria. Such insurance must be necessary in the interest of air commerce or national security or to carry out the foreign policy of the United States. Further the insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from a commercial insurance company. The FAA is seeking proposals from interested parties to procure aviation insurance support services in the administration and settlement of insurance claims, the collection of information on commercial aviation insurance markets, evaluating program finances, and risk management and insurance brokerage services.  Provision of these services requires insurance industry contacts and agreements sufficient to form integrated claims adjustment and settlement teams to fit the unique circumstances of individual claims.  Further, knowledge is required of aviation insurance markets and insurer financing and risk mitigation techniques.  The service provider must understand the FAA aviation insurance program's statutory authority and responsibilities, and how these interface and impact program insurance coverage and claims settlements.  Finally, the insurance service contractor should not have current ongoing service contracts or relationships with air carriers, insurance companies, or other insurance service companies that would create a conflict of interest with the performance of tasks under this indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.

Phase II:	Augment model capabilities and undertake initial quantitative assessment for all 3 coastal regions using publicly available and other data sources. Phase III:	Augment model capacities for the inland waterways and shallow draft ports and complete quantitative assessments.  The Model will be augmented to allow assessment of capital expenditures, ongoing marine activities and "what if" scenario analysis. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) Project, Earthquake Hazards Team, Geologic Division, US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to lease Ku-band space segment on two geostationary satellites with coverage of the western United States (all of California and Oregon, minimum). In order to reduce vulnerability to losses of satellite equipment, the NCSN intends to use two master earth stations, operating on two different satellites, along with numerous remote stations. The NCSN may also be expanding its network of satellite-telemetered stations over the next few years. Therefore, from five to as many as eight 100KHz channels, distributed over the two satellites, will be needed during that period.  It is imperative that these operations continue on the same satellites (Intelsat IA-5 and IA-6) and on transponders with the same polarization (vertical uplink).  The following specifications apply to the requirements of both satellites unless otherwise indicated. The five 100KHz channels will include three channels on Intelsat IA-5, transponder K01 and two channels on Intelsat IA-6, transponder K27.  The satellites requested are Intelsat IA-5 and IA-6 using transponders K01 and K27 respectively or other odd numbered transponders if necessary. Carrier Output Backoff should be 31.1db for IA5 and 28.5db for IA6. Uplinks must be within the range 14.0 - 14.5 GHz and be vertically polarized.  Downlinks for a given satellite must be within one of the following 500 MHz bands: 10.95-11.45 GHz, 11.2-11.7 GHz, 11.7-12.2 GHz, or 12.25-12.75 GHz. The bandwidth offered shall not include frequencies within 400 KHz of the ends of the transponder. The USGS requires "Transponder Protected" grade of service. The channels must all be on the same transponder and should have a backup or preemptible transponder available. The transponder proposed should not itself be preemptible. The space segment configuration must be compatible with the Nanometrics Inc. of Canada Libra Satellite Seismograph System installed at USGS, Menlo Park, CA. This system uses a 3.8-meter antenna at the hub and 1.8-meter antennas at the remote VSATs that are located in the western US region. This is a sources-sought notice.  The USGS is seeking responses from qualified prospective contractors who are capable of providing the required service on the requires satellites.  Specifically, the USGS is interested in SBA-certified 8(a) concerns, HUBzone businesses, and other small business concerns.  The responses received to this notice will determine the course of this forthcoming acquisition, as either a set-aside of some variety or unrestricted. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12.  A synopsis and separate solicitation (with complete technical specifications) will follow.   For further information or comments, please contact the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Interior Lighting and Filtering for Air Mobility Command (AMC) Aircraft.

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to explore commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies to provide a single installation solution to adequately illuminate its aircraft cockpits for daytime missions, non-Night Vision Imaging Systems (NVIS) equipped nighttime missions, and NVIS equipped nighttime missions. Through this RFI, the US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is requesting information concerning mature technologies that meet these requirements.   

1.	AMC has a need for interior lighting solutions for its aircraft that can directly replace the multiple incandescent lamps currently used for cockpit and annunciator illumination.  The following bulb types have been identified for replacement on a C-5B and the upgraded Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) C-5B aircraft:

a.	MS25231-311 – 28V DC 
b.	MS25235-313 – 28V DC
c.	MS25237-327 – 28V AC
d.	MS25237-328 – 6V AC
e.	MS18209-387 – 28V AC
f.	MS24515-718 – 28V AC
g.	MS25069-1495 – 28V AC

Modifications to change the power supply to these light bulbs are beyond the scope of this RFI.  All solutions should be based upon using the existing power supply for the circuit the socket is connected to.  The preferred approach is to use replacement LED bulbs emitting 505 nm or 525 nm LED based Bulbs. 

2.	LED based replacements require a dimming capability based on existing dimming rheostats/switches for the circuit that the LEDs will be used in.  The replacement lighting solution should identify solutions for varying brightness to suit daytime and nighttime “naked eye” readability using the existing dimming circuitry in the lighting circuit.

3.	The replacement LEDs must emit light that conforms to the Aeronautical Systems Center Crew Systems Branch (ASC/ENFC) 96-01 standards for NVIS compatibility.  The replacement LEDs must have reduced power requirements and improved lifespan compared to the current incandescent light bulbs.  Direct replacement solutions are preferred but all options that comply with the wavelength, chromaticity, and radiance requirements of ASC/ENFC 96-01 for Type I, Class B NVIS devices are requested.

4.	The replacement LEDs must also meet daytime visibility requirements listed in the same ASC/ENFC 06-01.

5.	Laboratory testing has found that a tinted encapsulation reduces the NVIS radiance of green LED bulbs.  This will also help differentiate the LEDs from standard incandescent sources. 

6.	Some of the existing instrumentation is internally lit and cannot be modified due to the supply chain of these parts.  These types of instruments may require a NVIS compatible post light assembly, ring-bezel light assembly, or overlay filter as appropriate.  The preferred approach focuses on using post and/or ring-bezel type LEDs.

The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE purchases over $23 billion worth of goods and services annually including facility management, remediation, construction, research and development, management and scientific consulting, plate work manufacturing, administrative services, data processing, security, engineering, and waste treatment and disposal.  Features of this yearâ€™s conference include: -- PLENARY SESSIONS featuring prominent government, corporate and business leaders who will discuss ways small businesses can have better access to DOE procurement opportunities; -- BUSINESS EXPO providing an opportunity for businesses to showcase their products and services to hundreds of corporate and government attendees, including DOEâ€™s Prime Contractors; -- MATCHMAKING FORUM providing a unique opportunity to schedule one-on-one meetings with procurement representatives from DOEâ€™s Prime Contractors and share in over $1 billion of possible subcontracting opportunities within FY 2006; DOE has received positive reviews on the previous conferences. This year's conference will continue to provide the essential information and guidance needed to do business with the Department.  It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.

<SUBJECT>J -- Maintenance and Repair
<DESC>The US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) contracting office intends to award a sole source contract to AccuTech Systems, Inc. for the routine maintenance and emergency service, including repairs, of the existent Hirsch access control and detection system and Pelco closed circuit television system at the SEC headquarters facility located in Washington, DC.  The contractor will also be responsible for providing all routine maintenance and emergency service/repairs of the Hirsch access control and detection system and related security barriers integrated with that system, the Pelco closed circuit television system, weapons detection systems, and chemical detection systems.  

AccuTech Systems, Inc., a Hirsch and Pelco certified Value Added Reseller (VAR) is the contractor that installed the Hirsch and Pelco systems at the SEC headquarters facility.   AccuTech Systems, Inc. also installed the weapons detection and chemical detection systems.    The routine maintenance and repairs of the Hirsch system needs to be completed by a Hirsch certified VAR for the Hirsch warranties to remain valid.  In addition, for the contractor installation warranties on all systems referenced to remain valid throughout the warranty period, the maintenance, repairs, service, and installations need to be completed during this period by the actual contractor that warranties the system.  

Therefore, this sole source award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other service will satisfy agency requirements due to the substantial duplication in cost that would not be recovered through competition if the Government were to award to a different contractor. 

SEC intends to award a fixed price contract for maintenance, repairs and service work.  The estimated value of the two year contract is under $500,000. Any inquires for this acquistion must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Wright-Samuel, SEC, P&C Branch, Stop 0-20, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria, VA. 22312.

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 561621 with a size standard of $11.5 million dollars. Reference Note 22, 4 days in lieu of 45 days applies for this requirement.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA’s Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA’s response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (OFDA/DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support Division (OFDA/PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OFDA/OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA/Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

* Develop various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs and assessment teams.  Provide briefings and written reports as required;
* Conduct personnel-related activities, property management, safety and security assessments, supply management, contracting services, leasing, travel, and records management, as needed and when tasked;
* Coordinate delivery of relief supplies provided by OFDA. Ensure that distribution is carried out in accordance with USAID policies and regulations and with OFDA strategies;
* Interpret USAID policies and apply them to OFDA activities as appropriate;
* Determine availability of support resources including staff, equipment, storage, office space, and communications; identify the obligating authority for procurement of supplies, commodities and services;
* Participate in appropriate training either as a participant and/or trainer;
* Operate DART communications equipment and operate a four-wheel drive or standard-shift vehicle in cross-country conditions;

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation RFQ-NCI-60062-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-09.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program plans to enter into a contract for the drafting of Clinical Trials Agreements (CTAs), Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) and Materials Transfer Agreements (MTAs).  The North American Industry Classification code is 541990, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses.

Background

The mission of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) is to improve the lives of cancer patients by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. CTEP accomplishes this mission by funding an extensive national program of cancer research and by sponsoring clinical trials to evaluate new anti-cancer agents, with a particular emphasis on translational research to elucidate molecular targets and mechanisms of drug effects.

Purpose

The Agreement Coordination Group of the Regulatory Affairs Branch of CTEP is responsible for the preparation and execution of all agreements for the non-clinical and clinical development of agents that are in the CTEP portfolio. This includes all clinical collaborative agreements such as Clinical Trials Agreements (CTAs) and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) as well as all Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) for non-clinical studies. A high priority program within CTEP is the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program and this Group is responsible for negotiating and executing all of the MTAs to support this Program with the pharmaceutical companies and the participating institutions. The Group also negotiates and executes the confidentiality agreements for the initial meetings with potential collaborators and is responsible for coordinating all collaborator interactions with CTEP. 

Statement of Work

Following further review by the Coordinator, additional corrections and revisions will be expected 1 day later. For all other agreements, the contractor will be given the timeline based on the complexity of the agreement at the time the work is assigned. CRADA Research plans would be expected to take at least 2-3 weeks to complete the initial draft because of the detailed information that must be researched for inclusion in the research plan. Material Transfer Agreements would be expected to take about a week to draft. Revisions would be expected within 2 days of receiving corrections from the Coordinator.

•	The contractor will also provide guidance and recommendations to the Coordinator to assist in the preparation of agreements.

The above timelines would be followed for the drafting and revision of all agreements assigned.

•	The contractor shall recommend appropriate wording to the Coordinator, Research and Development Agreements for the NCI Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDAs) with potential pharmaceutical collaborators for exchange of information; CDAs for CTEP staff to attend advisory meetings and CDAs with companies interested in agents that DCTD is no longer developing. The contractor shall have good understanding of CTEP policies and procedures in order to appropriately draft the required agreement. The contractor will also be responsible for drafting all of the CDAs to support the participation of the Investigational Drug Steering Committee (IDSC) members as described by the Clinical Trials Working Group in the review of CTEP drug development plans. 

•	The contractor will review the Conflict of Interest forms for the IDSC members and make recommendations to the Coordinator regarding which members should participate for a given meeting. The review will be expected within a week of receiving all of the completed forms.

There will be at least 24-30 agreements per year in support of this program. 

•	The contractor shall draft Cooperative Research and Development Research Agreement (CRADA) research plans to support DCTD development activities.  This will require the contractor to be present for meetings with the pharmaceutical company in order to understand the scope of the work to be covered in the research plan. The contractor will receive from the Coordinator specific scientific documents such as the Drug Development Group summary, the Investigator’s Brochure and the draft clinical solicitation for use in the preparation of the research plan. The contractor may be required to search the scientific literature for additional background information as well as contact the company for its background data.   

•	The contractor shall review all NCI technology abstracts to ensure that technology advertised is consistent with DCTD obligations and agreements.

<DESC>The due date and time has passed for submission of questions regarding the subject solicitation. No further questions or clarifications can be entertained.  Attached is a consolidated list of questions and answers regarding the fitness center procurement and walkthrough.  Please remember the due date and time for proposals is May 9, 2006 at 3:00 p.m. EST.

QUESTIONS FOR FITNESS CENTER


Q. What is the size of the center (in terms of square footage)? 
A. The Fitness Center is 6,545 sq. ft. including the work-out area, fitness floor, lockers, storage, and office.

Q. What is the capacity of the facility?
A. Capacity currently stands at 112

Q. What is the eligible population for membership? 
A. Current eligible population is 2,000.  This figure does not include potential contract personnel at approximately 500.

Q. How many members do you currently have? 
A. Membership stands at 220.

Q. What is the current utilization (members per day)? 
A. Current utilization stands at 55 – 65 per day.

Q. How do you collect dues - is it through payroll deduction?  Is the contractor responsible for the associated costs of EFT or payroll deduction? 
A. Dues are currently collected via a drop box located in the fitness center lobby and are payable by check.  We are transitioning to a Web Based system as the primary vehicle for collection but will not have this in place until the fourth quarter (Q4) of this year.

Q. Do you already have software for membership management?  If so, what kind? 
A. The software is supplied by the current manager, Federal Occupational Health (FOH), a component of US Department of Health and Human Services.

Q. Do you desire a formal personal training program (individually paid trainers versus individual programs provided by on-site full-time staff)?  What is the current financial arrangement/agreement for this program? 
A. This has not been called out in the SOW and is not a current service offered. If your firm wishes to provide such service, please include it in your proposed firm fixed price solution.

Q. The RFP requests a minimum of 5 group exercise classes per week.  How many classes per week are currently offered?  Do you desire a combination of on-site staff and part-time instructors teaching classes? 
A. There are currently 10 classes per week. TSA leaves it up to each vendor on how it wishes to staff for this firm fixed price procurement.  

Q. Will the government provide a computer, phone, e-mail, and Internet connectivity for the fitness center staff? 
A. We will provide a computer, phone, e-mail and connectivity in the fitness center office to personnel once they have successfully gone through the Security Background process.

Q. Who incurs the cost for the background investigation of team members? 
A. The contractor incurs said cost(s).

Q. Are towels supplied for the members to use or do they have to bring their own?
A. Towels are not supplied.

Q. At the moment, the government pays for TSA employees while contractors pay a price of $78.00 per quarter.  But, in the future you would like the fitness center to be self-sustaining by using non-appropriated funds?
A. The government does not pay for any membership dues; all members pay the quarterly fee of $78.00.  Our goal is to be self-sustaining. Currently contractors are not allowed to use the facility due to FOH rules.

Q. Have you given consideration to family membership for an additional price? There are pros and cons to this idea.
A. Family membership is not an option due to the Security Access issues with our facility.

Q. How does the person who is overall in charge of TSA feel about the fitness center?  Does He/She use the center?  Does He/She support it?

A. We do not believe the Administrator of TSA uses the facility for whatever reason he has. Management supports providing the facility.

Q. Are TSA employee and contractors given time during work to use the fitness center?  If so, how much and, i

<DESC>The Offeror Certs and Reps you need to register and complete via the Online Representations and Certifications Application at:
 
https://orca.bpn.gov/ Please advise in your proposal that your firm has done this.

The synopsis / solicitation was suppose to have been amended to read as such. There should be no separate certification and representations.  Please register and complete at the above url.s this time at the convince of the employee or only at certain times of the day (per se before work, in conjunction with lunch, or after work)

A. There is no official policy on this issue but rather workout times are coordinated on a case by case basis with the individual’s supervisor.

Q. Are there running/walking paths outside of the building?  I ask this with thoughts in mind of promoting the fitness center and increasing membership.

A. TSA is located within Pentagon City which has a large amount of traffic.  However, there are walking and jogging paths in the vicinity. There are many joggers in the area.

Q. What financial institution does TSA use?  Is it in close proximity?  Is there a safe on hand to keep checks for a short period of time (it is a practical assumption that all members will not update their membership on the same day so monies will be on hand for a short time or is the payment taken through payroll deduction)

A. This cannot be addressed at this time. Further, as clarified above, TSA is looking to implement a web based payment collection in Q4.

Q. What are the procedures for a person who is not a full-time staff member of the fitness center to gain access to the facility to teach group exercise (ie Pilates)?

A. Currently personnel who have access to member records would need the full clearance to gain access. Visitors such as guest instructors would be required to sign in at the Visitor Center and be escorted into the facility by badged contractor staff.

Q. What time does the cleaning crew clean the fitness facility and what are they contracted out to do, if in fact it is contracted?

A. The janitorial staff cleans both locker areas 2 times per day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  They are contracted staff responsible for the locker rooms, fitness floor, mirrors, and windows but not the fitness equipment.

Q. Is there a thermostat located in the fitness center to regulate the climate?  The center should maintain a constant temperature year round.  It is conducive to maintaining an exercise regimen. 

A. The HVAC is currently controlled by the automated building systems but has an independent set point from the rest of the suite.  All adjustments need to be called in to engineering for action.

Q. The SOW made statement of a “Confidential and Non-disclosure Agreement” as well as a “Certification and Representations Clause” being attached to the SOW but as I went through the document, I failed to locate them. 
A. The FedBizOps posting was amended to state please contact TSA to receive a copy of the SOW and NDA.

Questions from Walk Through

Q. What is the current warranty on the equipment?
A. The warranty period for all equipment was is included on the list of equipment hand out during the walkthrough.

Q. What insurance is currently in place for the facility?
A. The Government is self insured and since a government entity (FOH) currently manages the facility, no insurance policy is required.  It would appear that a private organization such as a contractor would have to have, at a minimum, liability insurance.

Q.Is the selected company allowed to provide items that would produce revenue for that company?
A.This question has been posed to our Chief Counsel for a response. An answer is pending.
