The Brigham Young  University Plant and Soil testing lab has been analyzing soil samples for USGS from the inception of our current research program.  In order to ensure that research results from previous years and sites are comparable with current and future research activities, it is necessary to continue working with the same testing facility.  Other laboratory facilities use different analytical protocols and instrumentation, and thus provide data which often are not directly comparable to those provided by the BYU Lab.  Use of other sources would compromise the integrity and future research and the value of past research.  Services to be provided are laboratory analyses of soil and plant samples (physical and chemical properties).  USGS will provide samples for analysis which will be due 90 days after receipt.  One or more of the following tests will be performed on samples: Nitrate; Phosphorous; Potassium; Organic Matter; An, Fe, Mn, cu, pH & Salinity; pH, BC, SAR; CBC; Texture; Exchangeable ions; Total nitrogen; Particle size analysis; Sand size fractions; Calcium carbonate; Mineralizable N; Resin capsules with incubation; Resin capsules without incubation; Resin bags; PLANT ANALYSIS; P1-N, P, K, Zu, Fe, Mn, Cu, Cs, Mg, S; N; Nitrate; Root CEO.  Period of performance: Date of Award for 1 year and up to 2 option Years.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  Simplified Acquisition procedures will be used with an estimed award date of 07/03/2006.  This is not a request for competive quotes.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond within 10 days of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (209)742-5089 or email amargrave@usgs.gov.  A determination not to continue with this acquisition based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center plans to issue a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) for the continued operation of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which provides full science management for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Program and operates the HST science operations facility. AURA will provide the products and services required to execute the science program, schedule and create command loads for the telescope, maintain and calibrate the onboard instruments, maintain the ground systems, archive and distribute the science data, manage the grants program, perform public outreach and conduct astronomical research during the remaining years of the HST science mission.  Critical work includes HST science operations, ground system sustaining engineering, mission planning and development and execution of the Servicing Mission Orbital Verification (SMOV) Program.  Another Space Shuttle visit to HST, Servicing Mission 4 (SM4), is planned to provide new hardware and enable science data collection through 2013.  The basic period of performance for this contract is May 1, 2007 through April 30, 2010, with two, 3-year options.  The current contract with AURA for the STScI expires on April 30, 2007.   NASA intends to enter into a sole source contract with AURA under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  AURA has been operating the STScI throughout the entire mission lifetime of the HST to date, and is the only known source that possesses the required general and HST-specific experience and expertise for all areas of the contract.	HST is a highly complex and internationally acclaimed spacecraft that provides unique astronomical observing capabilities.  AURA is the only contractor that possesses a complete knowledge of HST-specific requirements in the critical areas of science planning and scheduling.  AURA’s expertise in science operations is required to ensure the safety of the science instruments and to process the data so that high-value, calibrated products can be effectively distributed to the astronomical community.  In addition, AURA is the only known source that possesses the end-to-end life cycle knowledge and operational skill set for the past, present, and future HST instrument suites.  AURA has already modified systems to service five replacement instruments and Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, which were installed under four previous servicing missions.  AURA is also currently modifying systems for the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Instrument and Wide Field Camera 3 Instrument for the next planned SM.  AURA modified the systems and refined the software development processes to allow new instruments to be supported at low risk.  Also, AURA has either made or is in the process of making extensive, complex modifications to the HST spacecraft planning, scheduling, and command load generation systems to support recent mission-critical life extension activities including Two-Gyro and One-Gyro Control Modes and the reduction of HST transmitter duty cycles.  Additionally, AURA created the only reference source that can meet the guide star requirements for the mission.  The algorithms needed to interpret and translate this information into spacecraft commanding instructions is unduplicated since no other satellites have the stringent pointing requirements or the guide star tracking instrumentation that HST has.	In addition, as NASA Prepares for the upcoming SM4 (currently planned for less than one year after the follow-on contract start date), no other contractor could attain AURA's extensive level of experience with the HST Observatory, its instruments, ground systems and software and obtain the knowledge of past HST servicing missions to perform critical mission planning and mission execution requirements in the timeframe needed for SM4.	     The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 6, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. See note 22.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) plans to post a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in the summer of 2006 that will solicit basic research proposals in the areas of advanced imaging and non-imaging sciences that support Space Situational Awareness (SSA).  In this context, the phrase SSA denotes imaging and characterizing man-made space objects.  The BAA will seek focused proposals for SSA-related basic research in four topic areas:  novel ways to collect and analyze SSA-related optical data; image and signal processing; enabling mathematics; and high-performance computing. The winning proposal will establish a coordinated program interconnecting these four areas and leveraging results in one area to advance another.  In addition, the winner will be expected to establish close ties with and emphasize technology transition to the Air Force Maui Optics and Supercomputing (AMOS) site in Maui, HI.  More information on AMOS and its mission can be found at http://www.maui.afmc.af.mil.  The anticipated award amount will be on the order of $500K/year for five years.

<DESC>The work involves logging out the trail travel way of downed or leaning trees, removing loose rocks and woody debris that have entered the trailway since the last maintenance, and cleaning to original design all existing drainage facilities. No brushing or blasting is required. ATV trail drainage structures will require considerably more work than non-ATV structures. Government estimates of time are 15-30 minutes per ATV drainage structure (15 on the narrower Chain of Lakes structures and 30 on the Taylor/Jew Mtn/Drop Creek structures). There are approximately 50 structures per mile. These estimates are made either using a combination of machinery and hand finish work (50” maximum width on TR# 39 & 313 – Chain of Lakes & Bitterroot-Rock Divide, and 64” maximum width on TR# 182, 185 & 248 – Taylor Creek, Jew Mtn & Drop Creek) or by hand and tool work.

<DESC>Request for Proposals Notice for a Firm Fixed Price Contract to Install Industrial Steel Gates, Federal Building, 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, IA, 50309.  JOB PCN: RIA25466.  This procurement is full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is: 236220 and the small business size standard is $28.5 million. Issue Request for Proposals:  on or about 07/05/06.  Receive Proposals: on or about 08/05/06.  Estimated Cost Range: $100,000 - $250,000.  Time for completion: 90 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The project will replace the existing barricades with Government provided industrial steel gates, currently stored on-site, to include concrete and paving work creating additional parking spaces, rework of east planter, re-installation of one card reader, providing one new card reader, new bollards, and new security fencing, as detailed in the drawings and specifications for the Des Moines Federal Building located at 210 Walnut.  Proposal is for all work conducted in two phases.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, material that is not government furnished, and disposal required to complete this project.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 07/05/06.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 08/05/06.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  
GSA Project Management Division (6PC) is required to post its Requests for Proposal  on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website. The RFP and its amendments will be available through a link in www.fbo.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Registration in FEDTeDS requires current registration in CCR as a prerequisite.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  Offerors and other interested vendors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.   It is each vendor’s responsibility to monitor fedbizopps for amendments.
Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At a minimum, all vendors must supply the following information:

1. Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company CCR Point of Contact, 
2.  Your Company DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.  Your Company Tax ID Number, 
4.  Your Telephone Number, and 
5.  Your E-Mail Address.

Your CCR registration will take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

•	Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
•	The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
•	Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
•	Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
•	Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
•	Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
•	Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
•	Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>The projects consist of a follow up herbicide treatment to approximately 1006 acres of salt cedar and Russian olive regeneration along areas of the Pecos River corridor. A chemical application will be applied for the purpose of reducing invasive species, fire hazard potential, improving riparian habitat, and potentially increasing available ground and surface water. The project areas have previously been treated my mechanical extraction of salt cedar and Russian olive within the floodplain of the Pecos River.  The project areas are not physically delineated by markers, but are self-evident when visiting the sites due to the disturbance from mechanical extraction.  Areas within the project areas that where inaccessible to equipment because of ground conditions will also be treated by hand application of pesticide/herbicide. These areas will be identified and marked prior to the start of the project. Treatment may include some acreage of private land adjacent to federal land.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services for the preparation of CD64, HLA-A2, 4-1BBL Master Cell Bank with the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility at the Abramson Cancer Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104. 

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

Adoptive cell therapy is a promising approach for the immunotherapy of cancer but, optimal approaches for expanding T cells for adoptive cell therapy have not been defined. Artificial antigen presenting cells (aApcs) may expand CD8+ T cells more effectively than other approaches currently in use.  

The proposed project will create a master cell bank of the aAPC using GMP standards, which can subsequently be used in clinical trial of adoptive cell therapy for cancer.  The established master cell bank will be used for clinical studies in the future and will generate a master cell bank of K562 cells which stably express high levels of HLA-A2, DC64 and 4-1BBL.  Cells will be engineered using lentivirus vectors under GMP processing guidelines.  

The Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility at the Abramson Cancer Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania developed the artificial APCs which will be used in the master cell bank.   Also, they invented these cells and provided the first report of their efficacy in inducing CD8+ T cell expansion.  In addition they have experience in cell processing and are a highly regarded facility on cellular vaccines and processing for clinical trials.  They are the only source known to the NCI that can provide services regarding the aforementioned.  
   
This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on July 5, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to the following: Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  It is the vendors’ responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-60086-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the administration of indirect payment to awardees of Marshall Space Flight Center's individual faculty fellowship program. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services for the administration from American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) on a sole source basis. ASEE was awarded a Cooperative Agreement to administer the overall NASA summer faculty research program for all the NASA agencies. The agreement indicated individual centers are responsible for "administration of individual fellowships conducted at their center". The purchase order will pay for the awardees' time and expenses (paid through ASEE), but not for ASEE's participation (which is already covered by the CA).	ASEE has managed the overall program for the agencies for more than 20 years and is uniquely qualified to administer the MSFC-awarded fellowships.  Selecting another source would require incurrence of significant additional resources and time necessary to duplicate the program activities already completed or underway by ASEE. The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Janet Appleton at janet.appleton@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. CST by June 27, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located at 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor Michigan, requires an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Installation of Drager Gas and Aerosol Detection Sensors through Task Orders issued over a five (5) year contract performance period.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, equipment, hardware, and documentation necessary to complete the task orders. NVFEL currently has 140 Drager gas detection sensors situated throughout the facility.  These sensors monitor CO, NO2, O2, and LEL (lower explosion limit).  The sensors sample the air in work areas and go into an alarm state if levels of toxic gas are detected, if oxygen levels drop too low, or if levels of combustible gas go too high.  The sensors are connected to Quadgard controllers and networked to a Central Gas Detection System Computer.  All sensor levels and alarms are logged on the Central Computer.  The gas detection system is required to ensure that personnel are not exposed to toxic gases above the OSHA permissible exposure limits, thereby helping ensure a safe work environment. NVFEL periodically requires installation of additional gas detection sensors.  Furthermore, it is envisioned that over the next five (5) years, a number of hydraulic aerosol detectors will need to be installed to detect pump leaks on hydraulic test stands.  Under this IDIQ contract, the Contractor shall install gas detection sensors and hydraulic aerosol detectors as specified in task orders issued by the Contracting Officer.  Work will include power wiring as well as other incidental services  necessary to integrate the new installations with the existing gas detection system. An IDIQ contract is contemplated, under which firm-fixed-price task orders will be issued.  It is anticipated that the contract will specify a minimum order amount of $25,000 and a maximum order amount of $750,000 over the life of the contract.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Three evaluation factors, in addition to pricing, will be used: Technical Qualifications, Past Performance, and Response to Projected Initial Task Order.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. The solicitation with the Contract Statement of Work and Site Visit Information will be released through the internet at the www.fedbizopps.gov website.  The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 15 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Scott Tharp, in writing, via fax (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov with questions.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813319   IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BELOW-NOTED STATEMENT OF WORK 1.0	BACKGROUND The EPA Student Environmental Development Program (SEDP) is nationally recognized. SEDP is a 7 week summer environmental education and leadership development program. Students are trained by a certified  teacher, graduates and staff from EPA and partner agencies.   This versatile format is being used as a model for after school, day camps and summer programs.  Hands on learning and extended learning experiences (field trips) enhance the learning process.  Students are from all racial, economic and  cultural backgrounds and range in age from 12-14. Philadelphia (13th year), Wilmington, Delaware* (6th year) and Washington, D.C. (5th year),  Baltimore,  (2nd year) and in Chester from 1999 - 2002. This program has been designated by the Region Administrator as key and essential program and has  developed into a regional and national outreach initiative, and is considered an essential part of the Region's Environmental Information, Education and Outreach Program.  SEDP has been recognized by the EPA Administrator and the White House as a model program for other government agencies to  follow and has already been duplicated by many Non Government Agencies. 2.0  OBJECTIVE Under this Work Assignment, the contractor shall help in the design, development and implementation of the Student Environmental Development Program (SEDP) in Washington, D C. The SEDP will run from July 5, 2006,  until December 31, 2006.  The contractor shall provide the following activities: Project evaluation, measurement of success or failure and, recruit students and hire staff as needed, handle and coordinate transportation issues, provide finance and budget activities.  The contractor shall conduct  each of these activities in consolation with EPA SEDP Coordinator who is the primary contact for this assignment.  The contractor shall not take direction from other EPA personnel under this Work Assignment. During the course of the project payment will be made based on the submission of a request  for funds in the form of an invoice.  There should be no more than two invoices submitted. The contractor shall provide a detailed budget including expenditures and funds needed for that invoice period.  The objective is to provide a holistic education for the students. SEDP participants learn  about environmental issues they face every day in their urban communities contaminated fish consumption, children's asthma, sun safety, lead, radon, pesticides, indoor pollution, radon, and hazardous waste in the household.  Other non environmental topics include: how to communicate across cultural  lines, to speak publicly, and to work well in a diverse work place. Some of the topics that the students learn are; life skill, job skills, critical thinking, self esteem, peer pressure, team work and personal and civic responsibility.  The major objective is for the students, after graduation from  the program, to take their knowledge back to their own communities to teach others -- especially elementary school kids -- about the environmental issues that affect their lives.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 effective May 19, 2006. The small business size standard is $23 million dollars. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has a requirement for a contractor to process the 2006 EEO-5 Survey Reports.  The EEOC contemplates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract. CLIN 0001. The contractor shall process the 2006 EEO-5 Survey Reports  - Quantity 1 Lot, Unit Price $________, Total for CLIN 0001 $________.  The EEO-5 survey is used to collect data by race/ethnic categories, gender, broad occupational categories,  by full time, part time, and new hire status, from all public elementary and secondary school districts with 100 or more employees.  The survey is conducted biennially in the even numbered calendar years. There are about 7,500 public elementary-secondary schools who meet the filing requirement in any one survey year. This survey is a joint requirement of the EEOC and the Office for Civil Rights and the National Center for Education Statistics of the Department of Education. All three agencies use the data collected on this survey for their respective equal employment opportunity programs. This survey is a compliance survey required by Federal Law and accompanying regulations of the above agencies. Appendix A contains the survey instruments: EEO-5 form (168A), and instruction booklets.  The 2004 EEO-5 survey was processed entirely under a commercial contract. The contractor developed an on line filing system which was very well received by the school districts. Over 95% of the districts used electronic filing in 2004. The contractor is required to complete all phases of the EEO-5 survey from beginning to end. EEOC will provide government furnished property and expects to receive the complete data results, in the form of a final statistical file containing all employment data from each school district which submitted data, actual images of the documents received, and the unused supplies.  Work to be performed: The contractor shall perform the following tasks: A. Mail out: In the 2006 survey, only the methods described below will be allowed as options for filing. 1. On -line web based filing - The contractor will be required to offer this system as the preferred method of filing. A “Foxpro” based on line system was developed and used to great advantage in the previous (2004) survey, the prospective contractor can use this system or develop its own.; 2. Data file diskettes or CDs - to be filed by the 12 states (These are the states who file for all of the districts in the state) as before. Specifications for the data file lay out are contained in Appendix - A; 3. Paper forms/computer printouts - In order to meet EEOC’s obligation under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, the Commission is trying to phase out this method of filing and to the extent possible it should be discouraged. However, it is a legitimate method available to those who cannot file using either method 1 or 2.  Filing method number 1 will have to be developed to mirror the form and filing directions set forth in the instruction booklet.  It must provide tracking, automatic editing, and warnings when the new data is significantly different from what it was the previous cycle so that respondent school districts can make corrections before the data is submitted to the Joint Reporting Committee.  Proper security measures will have to be developed so that no breach of confidentiality will occur, including generation of and transmission of the unique school district ID numbers and pass words.  This system has the ability to incorporate filing method 2. Data files must be able to be read into the system.;  B. Type of Mail Out: There are three different methods of mailing out  EEO-5 forms. The 2004 final mail file will be used to extract the mail file for the 2006 initial as well as subsequent mail outs, and for imprinting paper forms. 1. Direct states mail out  - See appendix B  for the states which fall into this category. In these states the forms, or other notifications of filing, are sent directly to the school districts who return completed forms to be processed by the Joint Reporting Committee. 2. Coordinated states mail out - See appendix- C  for a listing of these states. In these states forms or other notifications of filing, are also sent directly to the school districts as in 1 above, with the single exception of the state of Delaware where the school districts forms are mailed to the state coordinator who distributes them to the local districts, however the completed forms are returned to the state liaison officer who forwards them to the Joint Reporting Committee in all of these states. The liaison officer also follows up on non-respondents.  In the case of on line filers, the state liaison would be sent a copy of the on line filing by the district. The state liaison officer is also sent a list of the districts who have been mailed forms or other filing notification ( This is in effect a portion of the mail out log). 3. “Diskette/data file” states - See appendix- D  for a listing of states in this category. In these states the state education agency completes EEO-5 reports for each district in the state which meets the filing requirement and submits the data in a data file. See appendix - A for the record layout of these data files. No forms are mailed to any of the districts in these states.  The state education agency is mailed a notification of filing letter as part of the general mail out. The contractor shall propose a certification of data procedures that is acceptable by EEOC for those school districts that choose the on-line filing method. Note: Mail method 1 and 2 above include about 3,600 school districts (Form- equivalents). The Diskette/data file method includes approximately 3,900 districts (Form- equivalents).; C. 2006 Planned Mail out Procedure.; For direct mail and coordinated mail states, in an effort to emphasize the on line filing method, the initial mail out will consist of:1. Notification that the 2006 survey has commenced and provide the filing deadline., 2. Provide each school district with its unique EEO-5 ID number and pass word to access the on line filing system., 3. Advise the school districts of the other filing method options should they decide not use the on line filing method., 4. Provide instructions on how to request one of the other filing methods., 5. Provide EEO-5 filing instructions,  EEO-5 form , and specifications for filing a diskette data file as down loadable files.; D. Diskette/data file states - Provide survey notification including filing deadline, data file specifications, EEO-5 ID and password for use of up loading the data file directly should some of the states wish to do so.; E. Mail out supplies and quantities. The above initial mail out will consist of: 1. Survey notification letters - one page (front and back) - 3,613 (3,600 for direct and coordinated states plus 13 letters to the diskette/ data file states).; 2. Window business envelopes (4” x 9-1/2”) - 3,613.; 3. Postage for 3,613 letters.; 4. Printing the EEO-5 forms as they are requested by school districts. The maximum number of forms that would have to be printed is estimated to be no more than 1000. After the initial mail out the contractor must be prepared to respond to all those school districts who were mailed the initial survey notification but who desire to file either on the actual EEO-5 survey forms, computer print outs or on diskette/data file. Provisions must be made so that school districts can make this request by mail, e-mail, fax, or by downloading the required material from the website.; F. Mail out Control Logs. The contractor will provide three (3) copies of a mail out log for use in controlling the letters mailed out and for subsequent use in receipt and check in procedures and non response follow up mailings.; G. Mail out Reports. The initial mail out report must be submitted upon completion of the initial mail out. It must show the number of notices mailed to each of the different filing types. It must show the number of mailings by state and nation wide. Subsequent reports must be submitted on a weekly basis reporting the number of requests to file on one of the methods other than the on line system.; H. Receipt and Check In.  All EEO-5 mail will be received at a post office box, which the contractor is required to obtain and maintain during the length of the contract. Postmaster returns of the initial mail out must be resolved immediately by researching the addresses and if a better address can be found the letter must be re-mailed as soon as possible.  Postmaster returns are some time an indication that the school district may have undergone a merger, consolidation or closing. All survey returns received in the mail must be dated, logged in, and checked for completeness. Any correspondence received in the mail must have the unique identification number added and should be kept with the report to which it applies. Any non- routine correspondence (i.e., such as requests for special reporting procedures or requests for exemptions, congressional inquiries, etc) should be referred to EEOC immediately.; I. Manual Edits. The following are the required edits of all paper forms received: 1. Check for any changes to the pre-printed information such as - School district name, School district address, County name., 2. Indications of consolidation or closings., 3. Changes in type of agency which operates the district., 4. Check for the presence of the general statistics- number of schools and annexes operated by the district and presence of the October enrollment in the district., 5. Check and resolve any comments provided by the district in the remarks section of the form., 6. Check that the employment matrices contain only whole numbers, and that there are no factional entries or percentages., 7. Report should have data in all three matrices, i.e. full-time, part-time and new-hires., and 8. Check for the presence of a signature certifying the accuracy of the data.; J. Data Entry. All errors should be identified by the time the forms are ready to be keyed. It is important that all errors including matrix errors be identified as soon as possible so that if the school district needs to be contacted all discovered errors can be corrected with one contact, be that by phone, fax, e-mail, or letter. The data entry program should be designed to make all row and column checks to make certain that totals agree. Make sure that all address and other identifying information changes are keyed and verified.; K. Computer Edits. 1. Assign and verify that all FIPS county, state, and pmsa codes are correct., 2. All row and column totals equal the entries in the total columns, and the rows total, i.e. the sum of column A is equal to the sum of row 19., 3. The sum of rows 20 and 21 in column A is equal to the sum of columns B through K of row 22., 4. Check for the number of schools and the number of principals reported.  Generally there is only one principal for each school. If the above mentioned numbers are different, then an inquiry to the school district is required. On the average, there are .95 principles per school. Ratios 25% larger or smaller than this could be a flag of inconsistent reporting., 5. The overall ratio of school district enrollment to the number of classroom teachers, i.e. the sum of lines 5 and 6 on the full-time matrix,  is 20. Ratios which are either 50 % greater or less than this overall ratio should be questioned as it might point to reporting problems of either teachers or students. The above edits must be made on all school district data which is submitted as data files or which is submitted on-line.: L. Non - Response Procedure. 1. Thirty days after the filing deadline, a non-response notice will be mailed to all those school districts who have not submitted their EEO-5 data by any of the three filing methods. The notice will be prepared by EEOC and provided to the contractor for duplication and mail out., 2. A report containing all of those districts who are non - respondents at the end of the 30 days will be provided to EEOC for approval before the notices are mailed., 3. A second notice, using the same procedure as above, will be mailed 60 days after the filing deadline., and 4.A final notice will be mailed 90 days after the filing deadline.; M. Data base Development and Access. The data base shall contain all EEO-5 data no matter what method of filing was used to collect it. The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative shall have access to the data base as it is being built for monitoring purposes. The EEO-5 processing system has programs to retrieve data from the data base. This serves EEOC data disseminators in extracting reports for individual school districts, and state or national aggregates for dissemination to EEOC investigators, other government agencies, and the public. The contractor must expand this system to include (Participation - and Occupational distribution - rates) percentages, and if possible improve the layout of the retrieval formats.; N. Disposition of forms (form equivalents). The generated forms and computer printouts shall be imaged on CDs with retrieval capability to be used for data dissemination. After verification of the imaged data the contractor shall dispose of all paper filing documents. Diskettes and data files shall be provided to EEOC for use in data retrieval functions. Government Furnished Materials shall consist of the following: 1. 2004 final statistical file (diskette/CD) from which the 2006 mail file will be extracted, 2. EEO-5 form, 3. EEO-5 Instruction booklet, 4.

Sole source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently has a one-year project to test technology used in underwater sensors.  NIST utilizes the Robocrane suspension mechanism, which uses (6) six hoists, run in closed-loop servo mode, to manipulate a suspended platform in all 6 degrees of freedom (DOF).  NIST currently owns (1) one hoist needed to attach to the existing Robocrane that has been tested for performance requirements and for compatibility with the NIST control system.  Six (6) more hoists are needed in order for the Robocrane to work as required for the collection of data for the program.   The hoist is customized to NIST’s requirements with four sub components and two electronic interfaces.  The identical equipment is required to ensure 100 percent compatibility and functionality with the existing NIST Robocrane as configured.  Compatibility issues with include: maximum length, width and height to fit between structural members on limited deck space of NIST test boat, required cable speed combined with required pulling force, compatible electronic interfaces with NIST control system hardware and software for motor speed control and position encoder feedback. Applied Power is the only contractor who can provide NIST with these customized hoists, configured in the exact manner as the original.  

No solicitation package will be issued.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by June 27, 2006 will be considered by the Government.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Universal Safety Response, Inc. of Franklin, TN for the installation of an energy absorbing Ground Retractable Automobile Barrier (GRAB) at the Harold Washington Social Security Center (HWSSC), 600 W. Madison St., Chicago, IL 60661. To improve security, the SSA is seeking to install a vehicle barrier system capable of stopping unauthorized vehicles from entering the building. Most barrier systems are stationary and provide no energy absorption. The GRAB system complies with K12 standards for stopping a 15,000 pound truck traveling at 50 miles per hour and greatly reduces the risk of occupant injury by employing an energy absorbing net to stop speeding vehicles instead of conventional fixed barriers. In addition, the GRAB system can be redeployed in a very short period of time without technical support or major repair. Interested parties that feel they can provide a comparable vehicle barrier system may respond by submitting their capability statement and product information by email to Reggie.Poskocimas@ ssa.gov by 3:00 PM CDT on Wednesday, June 28, 2006. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.

<DESC>D –PATIENT-CENTRIC DATA BASE LICENSES(Claims Data) U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with PharMetrics, 311 Arsenal Street, Watertown, MA 02472. The Government anticipates making a fixed priced award of a Purchase Order with a twelve month period. This requirement is to acquire PharMetrics Claims Data that includes information of the patient, his/hers diagnosis procedures, charges negotiated by the insurance company and charges. 

BEA provides many economic measurements as part of the National 
Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).  The NIPAs are used for a 
variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in 
forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activities.  They 
include Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is considered 
the most useful summary measure of the nation’s production. 
BEA, as one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects 
source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and 
implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics 
to the public.  BEA collects source data for specific 
sectors of the economy.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis shall construct a price deflator for health services using retrospective claims data that contains medical and pharmacy claims for a large number of beneficiaries.  Specifically, the Government needs:

1.	Claims data that include information on the patient, his/her diagnosis, procedure, charges requested by the health provider, charges negotiated by the insurance company, and charges paid by the insurance company versus the patient.
2.	We need a data set that identifies separate disease episodes for each patient.
3.	The patients in the dataset must be representative of the population at large.
4.	The data must be clean—some vendors apply statistical algorithms to the data to identify anomalies and replace those observations with statistically sound imputations.  
5.	Our methods require millions of observations 

Deliverables to be performed:

The contractor shall provide claim level data for both prescription drugs and treatments for a large number of private insurance beneficiaries.   The data shall have an extract containing data on approximately 5 million patients from 1998 to 2005, or about 15 million observations.

 
All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing, or by sending an e-mail G. Jean Barrett at jean.barrett@noaa.gov or Jean.Hairston@noaa.gov.

This proposed contract action is for Cyotgentic Analysis of Perifpheral T-lymphocytes harvested from rat spleens (Rat Spectral Karyotyping (SKY)) for 60 test at different intervals in accordance with the below.  

  STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0	BACKGROUND

The United States Navy, Naval Health Research Center, Environmental Health Effects Laboratory (NHRC/EHE Lab) has a need for cytogenetic analysis of the peripheral T-lymphocytes cultured from rat spleen tissue obtained from animal studies conducted in our laboratories.  Chromosomal aberrations are abnormalities in the structure or number of chromosomes and are often responsible for a variety of diseases and genetic disorders.  These events may occur spontaneously or can be induced by environmental agents such as chemicals, radiation and ultraviolet light.  Recent studies have shown that an increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a predictor of cancer. In our continuing animal studies, we have detected significant levels of tungsten in the spleen of rats exposed orally to sodium tungstate for 70 consecutive days compared to controls. Chronic exposure to tungsten results in the accumulation of the metal in the spleen and may also cause changes to the chromosomes. Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral T-lymphocytes harvested from the spleens will be analyzed.  Spleens will be harvested from control and tungsten exposed P0 males and females on day 35 and day 70 of dosing and from the F1 males and females on post natal day 70.   

2.0	OBJECTIVE

This effort is to accomplish a cytogenetic analytical method by acquiring information for the diagnosis and identification of chromosomal aberrations in cultured cells from rat spleen tissue samples provided by NHRC/EHE Lab. Three groups of 20 rat spleen tissues will be sterilely harvested and shipped within 24 hours to a cytogenetics lab.  The lab has to receive the spleens within 24 hours of removal or the tissue will not survive.  Upon receipt of the tissues, spleen cells culture will be established from each tissue sample to obtain cells in metaphase.  The cells will be arrested in metaphase and analyzed for cytogenetic abnormalities using rat specific spectral karyotyping (SKY) probes.  Spectral karyotyping images capture should be no less than 20 metaphase spreads per sample. 

3.0	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

Tissues will be delivered to a cytogenetic lab on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year.  All tissues will be submitted for cytogenetic analysis no later than 30 September 2006.  All results must be received no later than 3 weeks from the date the lab receives the spleen from NHRC/ EHE Lab.

4.0	GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/MATERIALS/FACILITIES: 

N/A

5.0	REQUIREMENTS

„X	Approximately 60 rat spleen tissues will be provided by NHRC/ EHE Lab
„X	The tissues will be delivered at room temperature and in transport media by a commercial carrier or NHRC/ EHE personnel
„X	The spleens must be cultured within 24 hours of harvest to ensure cell viability 
„X	The contracted company can not be more than 350 miles from Wright Patterson Air Force base. This is to ensure that the spleens can be delivered during business hours and in a timely manner as not to disrupt the sample.
„X	Upon receipt of the tissues, spleen cells culture will be established from each tissue sample to obtain cells in metaphase.  The cells will be arrested in metaphase, fixed, applied to glass slides, and hybridized with rat specific spectral karyotyping probes.  Spectral karyotyping images capture should be no less than 20 metaphase spreads per sample.
„X	If the SKY analysis is extremely complex and exceeds the labor time allotted for a typical project, then NHRC/ EHE Lab will be immediately consulted.   
„X	The contracted company shall be responsible for providing all the necessary materials and reagents.
„X	The contracted company shall provide NHRC/EHE Lab with the raw data from about 60 rat tissue samples no later than 3 weeks after sample is received from NHRC/EHE Lab. A report and images will be generated and e-mailed to the contact person. 

For this acquisition the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is the Van Andel Institute.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider all quotations/responses received within three (3) days of the issuance of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
 
Anticipated Award Date:  27 June 2006

All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if received timely, will be considered which should include your CAGE code.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to acquire on a sole source basis FactSet’s financial workstation, including screening software and data on equities and corporate fixed income instruments for one year.  The estimated cost is $5,250/month for seven workstations (total $62,880).  This service is provided via the Internet through downloadable software. 

The OCC’s responsibilities require the monitoring of economic activity in the context of maintaining the safety and soundness of the national banking system.  This includes observation and analysis of financial market trends, credit risk in industries evolving through the business cycle, market-based measures of economic and credit conditions of industry concentrations in national bank loan portfolios, and macroeconomic conditions of regional economies where national banks operate.  The specific needs include data from and analysis of various financial markets, including the bond, secondary loan, derivative, mortgage and equity markets, financial statement data reported by corporations, which can be formulated into industry-level aggregates.   Examples include bond yield spreads, swap rates, stock betas, loan interest rate spreads over risk free rates, credit ratings, corporate capital expenditures, revenues, and various ratios of profitability and debt coverage.

While some of the services are provided by others, only FactSet provides all the services in the depth and in the detail required by the OCC.  

The following data are included in the FactSet subscription:

•	Detailed data on active and inactive corporate bonds, including daily OAS bond yield spreads, bond price, NAICS and other industry codes, current and historical ratings, as well as coupon and other features of each bond, for a significant historical period.
•	Ability to download historical data as parameter time series.
•	Daily stock prices, betas, and related equity market data.
•	Functionality to screen both bond and equity databases on a wide range of combined criteria.
•	Functionality to upload “canned,” formulated spreadsheets to retrieve data on screened equities, and bonds, which can be updated by routinely uploading the formulated spreadsheets.
•	Functionality to aggregate equity and bond data to create industry indexes or averages of a diverse array of metrics.
•	Functionality to screen on financial statement data, and integrate this screening with the equity and fixed income parameters.  The financial statement data is to be acquired separately.
•	Functionality to combine data sources, including domestic and international corporate financial statement data.

The FactSet product contains corporate, financial, bond and stock market and related data for corporations in all industries in one easy–to-use proprietary interface.  It also provides extensive news and analysis on these industries.  The FactSet product allows users to combine data from a variety of sources.  Users can create reports that combine equity and fixed income data into industry aggregate metrics.

The OCC requires this software and data to monitor and analyze market-based measures of industry credit risk on Banks as well as all industries to which national commercial banks lend money.  The market-based measures include both the bond and equity markets.  FactSet’s software provides not only an interface to access the data but also robust, manipulative software to filter and to aggregate relevant measures to industry-level indicators.

This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  Written or telephone requests for a solicitation will not be accepted.  A solicitation will not be issued.  All information received with 7 calendar days after the date of this notification that contains pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the contracting officer at the OCC.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH GENERAL OCEANICS INC.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO PURCHASE ONE EACH MODEL 8050 PCO2 MEASURING SYSTEM FOR THE NOAA PACIFIC MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY (NOAA-PMEL).  AUTHORITY FOR PROPOSED SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION IS FAR 6.302-1 ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AND NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY AGENCY NEEDS.  DELIVERY REQUIRED NLT 12/20/2006.  OVER THE LAST DECADE NOAA-PMEL HAS BECOME A LEADER IN AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO DETERMINE PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CO2 (PCO2) IN THE WORLD’S OCEANS.  IN ORDER TO DETECT THE SMALL SECULAR CHANGES IN OCEAN CARBON FLUXES, THESE GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS MUST BE OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE QUALITY.  NOAA-PMEL REQUIRES QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE GLOBAL MASS BALANCE OF CO2 TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE ACCURACY.  AS PART OF A MULTI-YEAR EFFORT TO QUANTIFY THE FLUX OF CARBON DIOXIDE BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND ATMOSPHERE UNDER NOAA’S CLIMATE FORCING PORTFOLIO, SYSTEMS TO MEASURE PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CO2 ARE BEING PLACED ON VOLUNTEER OBSERVING SHIPS AND RESEARCH SHIPS.  BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED SCOPE OF THE EFFORT, NOAA-PMEL AND AOML REQUIRE A COMMERCIAL VENDOR TO BUILD NEW UNITS TO EXACT SPECIFICATIONS.  GENERAL OCEANICS HAS PROVIDED UNDERWAY PCO2 SYSTEMS FOR NOAA-PMEL AND AOML IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  GENERAL OCEANICS HAS BEEN WORKING TO CREATE PCO2 SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE SPECIFICATIONS OF THE PCO2 SYSTEMS CURRENTLY IN USE BY PMEL AND AOML.  THE UNDERWAY SYSTEM MUST BE CAPABLE OF MEASURING ATMOSPHERIC PCO2 TO WITHIN PLUS OR MINUS 1 UATM AND SURFACE OCEAN PCO2 TO WITHIN PLUS OR MINUS 2 UATM.  THE SYSTEM MUST BE SELF-CONTAINED AND PORTABLE.  SYSTEM MUST BE FULLY OPERATIONAL AND INCLUDE 1) EQUILIBRATOR BOX FOR BOTH AIR AND SEAWATER LINES, FILTERS, FLOW CONTROLLERS, GAS DRYING SYSTEM, AND TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE SENSORS; AND 2) VALVE BOX THAT CONTAINS A VALCO MULTI-POSITION VALVE CONTROLLED BY AN ONBOARD COMPUTER AND INTERFACE ELECTRONICS, AND A LI-COR IR ANALYZER TO BE SUPPLIED BY THE USER.  THE VALCO MULTI-POSITION VALVE MUST TAKE A MINIMUM OF SIX GAS LINES FOR BOTH STANDARDS AND SAMPLES.  SOURCES WHICH MEET OR EXCEED THESE SPECIFICATIONS MAY SUBMIT SAME ALONG WITH CATALOG CUTS, BROCHURES, OR OTHER DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE FOR REVIEW.  SUCH SUBMISSIONS WILL ONLY BE USED TO DETERMINE IF A COMPETITIVE SOLICITAITON WILL BE ISSUED.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.  ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH SHALL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

The minimum contract award amount is $100,000. The maximum not-to-exceed amount is $12,000,000 for the 60 month period of performance. A full and open competition will be conducted among all qualified and interested bidders. The applicable FSC Code is 6910, SIC 7371 and NAICS 541511 with $23 million limitation.

All personnel working on this project must have Security Clearances at the Secret Level.

The place of performance is NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, SubSkillsNet Laboratory, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.

A Pre-Solicitation Conference is scheduled for 8th of June 2006 at the above referenced facility. All interested bidders are highly encourage to attend. Additional information will be posted in the solicitation on or about the 2nd of June 2006.

SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando TSD that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. 
    	
The SubSkillsNet product line has been ongoing since 1997.  During this timeframe, it has been receiving periodic updates to incorporate improved and new capabilities. NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified an ongoing requirement for the continued development of new and related products. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family including the Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT) and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT), and Photonics Mast On-Board Trainer (PMOBT) applications.

Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue Solicitation N65236-06-R-0848 as a sole source procurement to Readiness Management Support, LC., 1212 W. 19th Street, Panama City, FL 32405-4104.  This procurement covers the procurement of technical support for U.S. Central Command Air Forces (USCENTAF) Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) maintenance at sites in Afghanistan and Kyrgystan.  Services will include air traffic control operators and electronic equipment maintenance supporting airfields, air traffic control and landing systems, air to ground communications, surveillance and precision radar systems and voice communication systems equipment necessary to meet the mission requirements of the USCENTAF program.  The contract will provide critical mission support to operate and maintain aviation facilities and systems supporting joint services military personnel and coalition forces engaged in the Global War on Terrorism.  The majority of the work will be performed in a designated zone of hostile activity (Operation Enduring Freedom) and directly supports government-owned air traffic control and landing systems equipment.  If another contractor were to be awarded this bridge contract, the continuity of operations and the maintenance and operation of the equipment for the warfighter would be in jeopardy.  In an effort to minimize the transition, the bridge contract must be awarded to the contractor with its employees currently in Southwest Asia, until the competitive solicitation (N65236-06-R-0748) can be awarded.  Anticipated award date for N65236-06-R-0748 is 1 OCT 2006. An Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee type contract is anticipated.  The required period of performance is 31 August 2006 through 28 February 2006 with two three month option periods. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may submit comments in writing to the contract specialist, Janet Stone, Code 026JS, SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston, telephone number (843)218- 5906, e-mail address janet.stone@navy.mil, no later than 1400 local time (EST) on 05 July 2006.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>20--PROVIDE LUBE OIL POLISHING UNIT FOR THE FAIRBANKS MORSE OPPOSED PISTON (38ND 8 1/8) DIESEL ENGINE.
<SOLNBR>N6554006SCAM1
<RESPDATE>063006
<CONTACT>Steven Kovacs, Code 931, (215)897-1144, email: Stephen.N.Kovacs@navy.mil Walter Rauf, Code 9234 (215)897-7217, email: Walter.Rauf@navy.mil
<DESC>NAVSEA Philadelphia, PA is seeking expressions of interest, general information and data from potential sources to demonstrate the capability to provide a Lube Oil Polishing Unit for the Fairbanks Morse Opposed Piston (38ND 8 1/8) diesel engine.  After an evaluation of the submittals is complete, the Navy may select one or more systems for further development and potential procurement of 48 systems. The Fairbanks Morse Opposed Piston (38ND 8 1/8) diesel engine is used as the prime mover for the Ship Service Diesel Generators (SSDG) on LSD-41/49 Class ships.  The lube oil system has been a constant source of concern for these engines and has been very labor intensive to maintain due to the lack of a lube oil polishing system.  The lube oil service system filters currently in use on LSD-41/49 Class SSDGs only capture contaminant particles 25 microns and larger.  The Navy is seeking an independent lube oil polishing unit (kidney loop) that is capable of removing carbon soot, combustion byproducts and water from the engine lube oil.  The primary goal of the lube oil polishing unit is to eliminate solid particle contaminants in the 5-25 micron range and remove water from the engine lube oil down to a level of 0.05 percent by volume or less.  The Navy estimates that a SSDG kidney loop sump to sump lube oil polishing unit will eliminate up to 2-3 lube oil changes per year ther!  efore potentially doing away with four overhauls a year fleet wide. Specific requirements for the SSDG Lube Oil Polishing Unit are as follows: 1.Must be a permanently installed, skid mounted, kidney loop sump to sump system consisting of a pump, motor, controller, automated contaminant removal media, automated liquid removal media, power supply, valves, piping and heater/cooler (if necessary). 2.Capable of being installed on U.S. Navy Vessels (LSD-41/49 Class). 3.Capable of processing commercial SAE 40 lube oil with a temperature range of 50-225 degrees Fahrenheit. 4.Must be capable of operating independently of the diesel engine. 5.Capable of purifying the diesel engine sump, approximately 1000 gallons, a minimum four times a day (ƒî170 GPH capacity). 6.Must meet Grade B shock qualification. 7.Must fit within an approximate 4ft X 4ft X 5ft space with size and weight kept to a minimum and center of gravity placed as low as possible. 8.Solid contaminant removal media shall be capable of removing soot and other solid contaminants from the lube oil down to a level of 5 microns or smaller. 9.Liquid contaminant removal media shall be capable of removing water and other liquid contaminants from the engine lube oil down to a level of 0.05 percent by volume or less. 10.Capable of withstanding environmental conditions found in a U.S. Navy marine application, heat limitations and susceptibility to corrosion. The Navy is seeking to identify promising commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies that would yield a significant reduction of lube oil solid and liquid contamination with the aforementioned diesel engine.  Those lube oil polishing system manufacturers possessing such technologies can inform the Navy by providing the following information no later than 30 June 2006. Submissions for this announcement shall include the following information: 1.Past experience with similar type of lube oil polishing system including details of the system.  This shall include system configuration, quantity of oil processed in gpm, maximum acceptable water content of the filtrate and maximum acceptable particle size in microns, as a minimum.  In addition, the customer, how many systems were built, the cost of the systems, warranties and customer POC's, including phone numbers, shall be provided. 2.An estimate of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of the lube oil polishing unit including procurement, installation, maintenance, parts support, training, upgrades and improvements expected over a 25 year life expectancy. 3.Demonstrated reliability, projected Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of similar applications and estimated cost to repair. 4.Estimates for lube oil polishing system cost, weight (lb.), dimensions (ft.) and manufacturing lead-time. 5.Technical capabilities to design, manufacture, perform first article test, maintain and overhaul lube oil polishing system components. 6.Logistic capability for the development of commercial/military specification technical manuals, maintenance procedures, drawings and parts/material support. 7.Name of manufacturer and source of origin for major components. 8.Applicable laboratory test data (performance, reliability, maintenance, and durability) of similar applications and references used for evaluation. 9.An analysis of the projected obsolescence of component parts and their impact on operation and maintenance. 10.Maintenance requirements including level of maintenance (e.g. operator, depot and OEM level). 11.Disposal and handling of hazardous material requirements. 12.Materials list. This is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this announcement nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  PLEASE NOTE RESPONSE DATE FOR WHITE COPY IS DUE 30 JUNE 2006.  The following additional question and answer is provided: What are we doing in DNS?  The information age coming to undersea warfare has allowed the next generation of undersea warfare to be networked.  Undersea DNS is a capability that provides persistent undersea surveillance and influence of the battlespace using a distributed system that includes Unmanned Undersea Vehicles, distributed sensors, capital platforms including submarines and surface ships, all networked together.  I believe that there are Undersea DNS "building blocks" that can be configured to perform Undersea warfare missions including, SLOC, Sea Base defense, Barrier search, and Choke point.  We must identify the enabling technologies and system function requirements of this next generation Undersea warfare capability.  NUWC's first steps are to focus our scientific community on what we believe are the technology barriers that include sensors, transport, data fusion, communications, and detection in a distributed field.  NUWC can not do this alone; we are asking for NAVSEA permission to collaborate with the technical and war fighting community by co-sponsoring (with NDIA) the inaugural conference in Undersea Distributed Networked Systems in November 2006.  We look forward to the communities participation in the conference.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Physical Sciences Division (PSD) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Catholic University of America, Office of Sponsored Programs, 620 Michigan Ave, Washington, DC 20064. 

NOAA/SEC physicists V. Pizzo and D. Biesecker have recently been awarded a NASA LWS grant to develop new techniques for applying multi-view white-light observations of the solar corona to improve understanding and forecasting of Earthward-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The image data for the project will be provided by the NASA STEREO mission, which should begin producing binocular views of the corona in mid-summer of 2006. The project will utilize adaptations of two different techniques to greatly enhance our ability to characterize the properties of CMEs near the Sun. One is the geometric localization technique developed at SEC, which is based upon simple triangulation of points along the periphery of the CME as seen from the two views provided by the twin STEREO spacecraft. This will afford rough estimates for the CME location, size, shape, and motion.  

The other technique is the polarization analysis developed by Dr. Moran (at Catholic University) and Dr. Davila (at NASA/GSFC). This method takes advantage of the subtle signal contained in the polarized component in white light CMEs observed by the twin spacecraft. It will complement the geometric localization analysis by providing an impression of the finer structure within the CME as well as by yielding an independent estimate of key CME properties inferred by geometric localization.  Dr. Moran's responsibilities within the project are twofold. He shall provide the instrumental calibrations, background corrections, and methodology needed to extract accurate polarization data from the downlinked images in the low-resolution "beacon" data stream utilized in the project. In addition, his expertise as a consultant for polarization issues will be vital to combining successfully the results of polarization and geometric localization techniques in the new area of multi-view coronal analysis.

Dr. Moran, in collaboration with Dr. Davila, pioneered the use of polaroid imagery of CMEs using single-view SOHO/LASCO coronagraph data. In a landmark paper in Science (305, 66, 2004), they demonstrated for the first time that meticulously corrected polarization data could be used to obtain an impression of the three-dimensional structure of CMEs, a feat long hoped for by coronal physicists but never actually achieved. Dr. Moran's exhaustive work on the instrumental corrections was a key element in unlocking the power of polarization information for this application. In addition, his close collaboration with Dr. Davila, project scientist for the STEREO mission, his experience with handling real SOHO/LASCO data, and his familiarity with the STEREO instrumentation make him a unique fit to provide the corrected images and analytic expertise needed for the SEC project. Although several other researchers have since published studies in this highly specialized area, it has been judged, based upon a survey of the recent scientific literature and consultations with colleagues considered expert in this field, that Dr. Moran has by far the best grasp upon the proper calibration, reduction, and analysis of coronagraph polarization data.

The period of performance will be July 17, 2006 to June 16, 2007, with an option to extend for two more years, contingent upon acceptable performance and the availability of funds. The work is to be conducted at the recipient's home institution, making use of its equipment and resources. 

This announcement is being issued under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13 (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any responses shall be received in writing no later than July 11, 2006.  Anticipated Award date is July 12, 2006.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.     THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.       

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

The NIAID is seeking capability statements from sources that are capable of the development, optimization, qualification, and validation via Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) (21 CFR Part 58) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) (21 CFR Part 211) of product-neutral immunological assays, potency assays, and animal efficacy models for the evaluation and assessment of plague vaccine candidates based on F1 and V antigens.  These immunoassays and animal models will be developed in a manner that will support licensure of a plague vaccine under the FDA “Animal Rule,” (21 CFR Part 601.90-95).  

NIAID anticipates that a minimum of two species of reproducible animal efficacy models will be developed and characterized for both the pneumonic and bubonic forms of plague, one of which will be a small animal model and the other a NHP model.  Innate and adaptive immune responses will be analyzed and from these, correlates of protection will be identified.  The development and subsequent validation of immunoassays associated with the correlates of protection includes the identification and provision for adequate amounts of standardized reagents.  NIAID will require that potency assays be developed, characterized, and validated.  Once validated, these immunoassays, potency assays, and animal models will provide important tools for researchers and manufacturers, and therefore, reagents, methods, and procedures must be transferable.  This effort will become a crucial part of a joint Government Agency effort to develop and license a plague vaccine for both military and civilian needs.  

Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:  1. relevant experience in conducting studies using Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as well as conducting validation studies; 2. capacity and adequacy of biocontainment facilities; 3. certification or recent application for Select Agent Approval or the ability to successfully meet the certification requirements; 4. capacity and adequacy of facilities for care and housing of animals, and; 5. relevant experience and expertise of personnel and adequacy of relevant training.

Interested organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by July 5, 2006.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

This request is for planning purposes only, and it does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes. It is not an indication the government will contract for the services contained in this SSS. The government shall not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this SSS.

Similar information has previously been sought under FedBizOpps announcements concerning: Draft RFP for PATE; sources sought synopses under the project names: Specialized Scientific, Engineering and Laboratory Management, Services and Support (SSELMSS), Specialty Network Laboratory Capability (SNLC), Materials Technology Specialized Program Support II (MTSPII), and Materials Technology Specialized Program Support (MTSPS).  

In an effort to determine if this acquisition is suitable for small businesses, the US Air Force is seeking information specifically from small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) small business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns only that have a Top Secret facility security clearance.  Capability packages submitted by interested small business entities, small business joint ventures, or teaming arrangements will be reviewed to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy.

PATE requirements are listed in parts I and II that follow:

I.  The PATE support services involve: in-house operation and management of specific laboratory functions at a Government facility; laboratory data trend analysis and reporting; nuclear engineering analysis and particle transport analysis; chemical engineering and related disciplines; inorganic, organic, analytical, physical and biological chemistry; molecular biology; microbial biology; virology; immunology; biological engineering; mechanical engineering and related disciplines; aerobiological modeling; and meteorology.

II. The PATE requirements will also require a contractor to maintain industry awareness of cutting-edge and/or specialized laboratory and technological services.  Additionally, a significant subcontracting opportunity for these services, as the requirements and sources are identified and needed, is anticipated.  These subcontracting opportunities would include: molecular biology to include real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR); genetic sequencing and micro-array technologies; microbial culture; immunology to include protein screening and mass spectroscopy technologies (including MSnth technologies); separation of biological materials of interest from complex sample matrices; meteorological support to include models of transport and diffusion processes; assay protocol/trouble shooting; enhancement of existing laboratory protocols; biochemical, chemical, microbiological, and/or immunological analyses; aerobiological modeling enhancement or modification to database platforms; and field test support and general sampler engineering development and design.  End of II. 

Although a 50% limitation on subcontracting (FAR 52.219-14) would normally apply for the significant PATE subcontracting opportunities (part II above), a waiver of this contract clause applying to the subcontracting of cutting-edge and/or specialized laboratory and technological services will be considered in order to enable an otherwise qualified small business to participate in this acquisition. 

Firms with a Top Secret facility clearance that respond to this announcement should express their experience in providing PATE-type services and their capability in providing the following minimum types of qualified, Top Secret-cleared resources for PATE:

1.  Any three personnel from two or more of the following four types of qualifications:
(i) molecular biology
(ii) microbiology
(iii) immunology or protein chemistry
(iv) biochemistry

2.  Any one person from any of the following two types of qualifications:
(i) nuclear engineering or nuclear physics
(ii) inorganic, organic, analytical, physical chemistry or chemical engineering

3.  Any one person from any of the following two types of qualifications:
(i) mechanical engineering and related discipline
(ii) meteorological sciences

4.  An additional person from any of the above listed eight qualifications.

Respondents should include their assigned Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) code.  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.  Include your Government assigned company Facility Code (also called CAGE code) for the applicable facility and storage facility that would safeguard any classified data supplied by the Government. 

Prospective firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary (maximum length 10 pages) describing the firm’s expertise and related experiences in meeting the requirements stated above to the contract specialist:  daniel.gill@patrick.af.mil.  A Top Secret facility clearance is required.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only.  W911QX-SS-06-7001 is being issued by the U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) to obtain information from potential small business sources to determine if the Armys requireme nt for technical support for research at experimental facilities located at Aberdeen Proving Ground and other sites may be set aside for small business.  This requirement will require ongoing support for a period of 5 years.  The government will review qua lification packages submitted by interested small businesses, and based on those submissions make a determination as to if this requirement can be satisfied through a Small Business Set-Aside or Partial Small Business Set-Aside.  This requirement is for te chnical support for research at experimental facilities located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, MD and other sites where researchers from the Army Research Laboratory are conducting experiments. Specifically, the contractor will be required to provid e support for various programs conducted by the Army Research Laboratory to include:  Experimental facility preparation, work scheduling, hardware fabrication, installation, setup, and test execution; equipment repair, inventory, and maintenance; instrumen tation development and use; sample preparation and mechanical testing; and preparation and maintenance of data bases. The contractor will be required to conduct research and development of energetic materials to include secondary explosives, pyrotechnic fo rmulations, and gun powder; setup experimental arrays for tests and execute the test and report and analyze results; conduct analyses of penetration by various types of lethal mechanisms; conduct electronic circuit design, fabrication, circuit and system t esting, and product assembly; support operation and maintenance of laboratory flight simulation systems and ground test equipment such as ballistic flight simulator, shock table, spin fixture, projectile balance fixture, and gyroscopes; fabricate or modify  many unique and precision items; perform all aspects of armor target assembly, preparation, transport, disassembly, repair, dissection, and analysis; maintain readiness of all guns, howitzers, recoil mechanisms, etc., by monitoring use and scheduling main tenance as required; prepare aircraft, ground, and personnel simulate targets for testing by engineering and fabricating  parts, components and sub-systems; conduct research and experimental development work in the broad mission areas of physics of deforma tion under ballistic conditions and conventional warfare survivability technology; support  the unmanned ground vehicle program; conduct analytical and experimental studies and evaluations to record and document the kinetic energy and high explosive antit ank munitions fired from the M1A1 as they impact against various targets (sand berms, vehicles and hard targets); general test support for experimental ballistic programs in terminal effects and projectile structural security.  Companies should demonstrate  their ability to provide between 100 and 150 highly skilled experienced professional workers with a skill mix representing both junior and senior scientists and engineers, engineering and electronics technicians, and engineering aides.  In most cases, ski ll levels are driven by mission requirements that are influenced by global situations involving U.S. Army Forces.  Company managers should have experience with Government support services contracting, and have experience overseeing a Government contract of  similar complexity.  Additionally, contractors should demonstrate the ability to provide the required mix and quantity of personnel required to perform the effort.  Qualification package submissions should include resumes of key personnel appropriate to f ill the various management and technical positions.  All personnel must be able to receive a favorable interim security clearance and able to ultimately receive  a Secret Clearance.  In order to perform this contract, a facility clearance up to the Secret level is required.  Qualification submissions should include evidence of such a clearance.   It is requested that the responses be brief, to the point, and no mo re than 10 pages long (the 10 pages can be exceeded if necessary to clarify your data).  Companies should include in their submission details of their organizations training program in Safety and Security related matters.

<DESC>General Information 1.  INTRODUCTION:   a.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to co ntract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Department of Defense is not seeking proposals, and will not accept any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be  solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.   It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this and any other pertinent website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. b.  The request is for information only and will allow the Army to identify alternative technical approaches and develop an estimate of program cost and effectiveness.  As part of the first phase, the Army may conduct an information exchange meeting with r epresentative companies under each of the alternatives cited in Paragraph 2, below.  It is anticipated that these meetings will take place in the July (?) timeframe.  As stated in Paragraph a., this does not constitute an RFP.  Life cycle costing informati on will strictly be used as an aid in ascertaining a Government estimate for these candidate representative solutions as a means to completion of the required Economic Analysis. 2.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support an Electronic Requirements Generator (ERG) for the U.S. Army.  The Government is looking for information in four categories:  (1) firms that have the resources (hardware, software, p eople, facilities) available which would allow the Government to out-source the capability; (2) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) products capable of fulfilling DODs needs; (3) a combination of categories (1) and (2); and (4) development of a solution that would fulfill DoDs sourcing needs within the stated timeframe. 3.  BACKGROUND:  Paperless contracting includes the acquisition function of purchase request creation and subsequent integration with a contract writing system.  The Army has deployed and implemented the DoD Standard Procurement System (SPS), Procurement D esktop Defense (PD²) to perform the contract writing function.  Lacking a standard purchase request system following the demise of the Sustaining Base Automation Services Programs Integrated Requisition and Purchase Request System (IRPRS) in 1999, the Arm y G-4 (Logistics) in cooperation with the ASA (AL&T) conducted a source selection to acquire a replacement.  The CACI, formerly American Management Systems (AMS), AcquiLine ® PRWeb application was selected to fulfill the purchase requisition creation and t racking functions, which included integration with the SPS/PD².  AcquiLine ® PRWeb is a COTS product which will not be migrated to support SPS/PD² Version 4.2 Inc 3, effectively closing the Armys access to a method of creating and routing purchase requests from the requiring activity to contracting electronically. An electronic requirement generation capability must be implemented with Business Modernization Management System Business Enterprise priorities. The Common Supplier Engagement priority includes a capability for managing requests.   4.  TIMEFRAMES:  For planning purposes, this RFI is being conducted in support of an ERG acquisition decision in the 2006/7 timeframe.  5.	            5.  CAPABILITIES:  Attachment A is the ERG Functionality Requirements Document.  It sets forth the required functional capabilities that must be provided for the ERG.  Those responding to this request,  must categorize responses by i dentifying capabilities that currently exist, capabilities currently under development, and capabilities that can be planned and scheduled.  For each of these three categories, responses are expected to address each subparagraph below.  All responses must be accompanied by a plan addressing the approach, including a schedule, which describes the candidate technology and proposed approach for the Army ERG, method of supply/delivery  (e.g. full delivery or spiral delivery with proposed approach to provide ful l capability), training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment.  Responses must also include information on licensing arrangements and an estimate of cost for the development, training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment of the ERG.  Responses are n ot to exceed the maximum equivalent of 35 pages, including schedules. a)	The solution must provide the capability for designated users in all Army requiring activities to have the capability of identifying requirements, approving requirements, routing the approved requirement data through appropriate financial management off ices to add and certify funding information, and finally routing the approved/funded requirement data to the designated contract writing system.  b)	The solution must operate in a web-based environment. c)	The solution must allow designated users to create and amend a uniquely defined Purchase Requirement (PR). d)	The solution must capture PR information at both the document and line item levels. e)	The solution must provide the ability to as associate and transmit exhibit and attachment documents. f)	The solution must provide the ability to display, save as an electronic file, and print a complete copy of each PR or PR amendment. g)	The solution must provide the ability for the user to request and receive a complete record of the disposition of each PR at both the document and line item level. h)	The solution must provide the ability for the user to route to one or more approving authorities, post approvals, route to a financial management system/activity, capture financial data and certification, and route to a contract writing system.  i)	The solution shall provide the capability to consolidate multiple PRs at the time of creation and throughout the routing process. j)	The solution must provide the ability for the user to search the contract writing system database for past purchase information based on several key data elements. k)	The solution must provide the ability to maintain a list of authorized user names, authorities, roles, profiles and statuses. l)	The solution must provide real-time data field validation supporting user data entry, and provide batch validation of system-defined business rules. m)	The solution must provide on line help to guide the user through the process and provide detailed information on each data element. n)	The solution must utilize standard data sources to the maximum extent practical; standard data sources include, but are not limited to Central Contractor Registration (CCR) vendor data for suggested sources, activities from the DOD Activities Address Fi le (DODAAF) and Federal Activities Registry, and elements of the Line of Accounting from the DFAS Operational Data Store (ODS). o)	The solution must encompass the tasks of deploying, administering and training for users and system administrators. p)	The solution must provide for single sign on using a Common Access Card (CAC) as the primary access methodology. q)	The solution shall support Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology for user authentication and electronic signature.  6.

<SUBJECT>99 -- AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT
<DESC>AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


INTENT: Federal Prison Industries, Inc (FPI) is seeking proposals for new products and/or service arrangements that would be sold to federal agencies and produced by FPI in alliance with the successful offerors. FPI may also provide certain services to the private sector. FPI is interested in entering into business agreements with private sector firms to produce any of a variety of products and/or services, using federal facilities and federal inmate labor. 

Description of Federal Prison Industries: Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), which operates under the trade name UNICOR, is a wholly-owned Government Corporation within the Department of Justice, under the Federal Prison system. The Corporation was created by Congress in 1934, and provides employment, education, and training opportunities to inmates under federal custody. FPI operates more than 102 factories at 71 locations. FPI's product lines are extensive and include over 175 separate products and services sold to federal agencies, such as Electronics, Office Furniture, Clothing and Textiles and Metal products. FPI is also a service provider, to include call centers, recycling center and distribution centers to the private sector. FPI's mission is to employ and provide training to the greatest practicable number of inmates in federal correctional facilities. FPI employs a large number of inmates to ensure the safe and secure operation of such institutions. FPI must be market competitive in terms of price, quality and delivery. FPI operates in a self-sustaining manner while minimizing potential negative impact on private sector business and labor. The inmates benefit from industrial education, as well as earning wages. Employment of inmates by FPI substantially reduces recidivism. 

Strategic Business Development Program: Federal Prison Industries currently has business agreements with private sector firms to provide products and services to the Federal Government, as well as services to the private sector. For some business agreements, FPI provides fully equipped and staffed factories and manufactures products and provides services as turn-key operations for its private sector partners. For other agreements, FPI simply provides inmate labor and the physical factory space for industrial operations or service. For a more detailed description of FPI and its operations, or to look at a sample business agreement, please visit http://www.unicor.gov/fpi_contracting/.

Miscellaneous: FPI reserves the right to accept or reject proposals received. This notice fulfills FAR Part 5 publication requirements for individual proposals received and meets CICA requirements. Therefore, the intent is to enter into negotiations and/or to contract for new products and services in response to this announcement, and may not be published on Fed Biz Ops. For a sample joint venture agreement, profile of FPI's human resources, available physical facilities and equipment, and schedule of current projects and services, please visit our website at http://www.unicor.gov/fpi_contracting/.

<DESC>NOTE: Contact the POC listed below and not the Government POC who posted this announcement. This announcement is being placed on FBO on behalf of the Lead Systems Integrator for the Future Combat System (FCS) program and is NOT a Government procureme nt. No Government solicitation will result from this announcement. The Boeing Company, in conjunction with our partner Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), together acting as Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) for the Army, is pleased to announce a new competitive bid opportunity for the Future Combat System (FCS) Large Caliber Automated Resupply (LCAR) solution.   The capability to resupply large caliber ammunition in an automated manner is a FCS BCT program requirement associated with three Manned Ground Vehicle variants:  the Non-Line-of-Sight  Cannon (NLO S-C), the Non-Line-of-Sight  Mortar (NLOS-M), and the Mounted Combat Systems (MCS).   The LCAR capability will be external to the MGV platforms, but will interface with ammunition entry ports that facilitate automated resupply to the internal ammunition h andling system in each of the platforms.    The LCAR capability will be truck transported and must be compatible with the Heavy Equipment Materiel Truck Transport Load Handling System (HEMTT LHS) and/or Trailer with Palletized Load System (PLS) Flat-rack, which are transportation assets organic to the FCS BCT.  No Material Handling Equipment (MHE) truck-mounted or otherwise will be considered. On 30 August 2006, the LSI will host an Industry Day event for companies interested in being considered as a potential supplier for the LCAR solution.  This Industry Day will be held in St. Louis, Missouri.  A Draft LCAR RFP will be released at Industry Da y.

<SUBJECT>--Integrated Test and Analysis Contract (ITAC) Industry Conference
<DESC>A Pre-Solicitation Industry Conference on the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Integrated Test and Analysis Contract (ITAC) is scheduled for Wednesday, 19 July 2006.  Conference will be from 13:00 PM to 15:00 PM CST (1:00 PM to 3:00 PM CST).  The conference will take place at the Four Points Sheraton, Huntsville Airport, 1000 Glenn Hearn Blvd, Huntsville, AL 35824(phone number 256-772-9661).  Conference attendees can park in the Four Points Sh eraton parking lot and have their ticket validated at the front desk.  Conference attendance will be by electronic registration only and will be available at the following website NLT 16 June 2006:  http://www.smdc.army.mil/contracts/itac.html.  Registrati on will be available through July 17, 2006.  The Government is not liable for any expenses incurred by an attendee or eventual offeror in order to attend this conference.  This conference is not open to participation for foreign firms at either the prime o r subcontract level.  The conference will address technical requirements, contractual and business-related issues, as well as information on the acquisition strategy and the schedule.  Interested parties may also submit questions/issues you would like to h ave addressed at the conference to Nicole Meenen by email (nicole.meenen@smdc.army.mil) no later than 30 June 2006.  Correspondence should reference ITAC RFP number  W9113M-06-R-0017.  The contract requires an integration contractor team to plan, organize and coordinate operations/tests/analyses with comprehensive, widely distributed experimental weapons systems, or credible representations thereof, such as Ground Base d Midcourse Missile Defense hardware/element labs, early warning radars, sea-based missile defense elements, mid and lower tier missile defense elements, or representative element simulations; and/or other equipment of interest, such as communications netw ork hardware/simulation, command and control, and/or threat systems data.  Combinations may include, but are not limited to items such as weapons system Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) laboratories, Software-in-the-Loop (SWIL), detailed (up to and including de tailed engineering level) modeling and simulation (M&S) products, trustworthy databases reflecting detailed weapon system operations, threat system representations and /or any other asset required, for integrated test and analysis experiments.   Initial em phasis is expected by SMDC/ARSTRAT to be placed upon but not be limited to all varieties of missile defense operations (and related offensive operations) against threats in all phases of operational envelopes. Test and analysis experimental configurations are customer driven in accordance with directly stated objectives or derived from senior leadership expectations.  To perform this scope of work (SOW), SMDC/ARSTRAT and the ITAC contractor shall seek out partnerships with DoD and other US Government organi zations (and their lead contractor organizations) to obtain the requisite capabilities.  Task orders will be issued by the SMDC/ARSTRAT to accomplish the ITAC requirements.  Several US Government supported efforts are expected to be integrated into the per formance of this contract through the use of directed subcontractors to the ITAC prime contractor. Each present or future Directed subcontractor is precluded from participating as a member of the prime team.  The Missile Defense System Exerciser (MDSE) dev eloped by Teledyne Brown Engineering is expected to be heavily leveraged with the ITAC tasks, but the scope of ITAC is more comprehensive than just existing (circa 2006) MDSE operations.  Likewise, the Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense Embedded Test ( ET) capability developed by the Boeing Company is expected to be leveraged along with the Integrated System Test Capability (ISTC) resources and US Government supported contractor radar laboratories operated by the Raytheon Company.  The center for these activities is expected to be at Government facilities that have yet to be identified. The anticipated competition will be a small business set-aside and will result in an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract with a period of performance of five years with one five-year award term. It is anticipated that the requirements will be  executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements. ITAC integration tasks shall revolve around (but not be limited to) the following core functions: program and task management; derive specific ITAC requirements from customer event de finitions; purchase task-enabling hardware, software, network, or any other material items; integrate geographically distributed customer-specified assets into acceptable test and analysis event configurations; provide operational networks of HWIL, SWIL, c ommunication linkages, etc.; perform functional and qualification testing; perform and/or assist customer agents with event operations; arrange for data collection, storage, processing, and delivery; assist independent verification, validation, accreditati on, and qualification agents; and assist independent configuration management agents. Software developed incidental to the performance of the contract shall be delivered to the Government as both source and executable code and shall be considered a Special Work pursuant to DFARs 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works. The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC contracts. To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interest s, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual technical analysis performance.	  The NAICS code for this small business set-aside competition is 541710/1000 employees.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  Schedule, OCI clauses, draft RFP, and any other draft doc uments/information will be posted and updated on the USASMDC website  http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/itac.html.

7.0  Brand Name Justification:  The Personal Locator Beacons (PLB) transmits on 406 MHz via the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system with a unique, digitally coded distress signal and transmits a 121.5 MHz SAR homing signal.  This unit has all of the following unique characteristics which other PLBs to not have: (1) The unit must be a U.S. legal PLB or “FCC approved”.  The U.S. added two notable requirements to the international PLB standards.  PLBs that are not U.S. legal cannot be registered with NOAA, (2) It must have a 406 MHz distress beacon.  A 406 MHz distress beacon is more accurate than a 121.5 MHz beacon.  Also, the 121.5 MHz beacon does not have GPS capability and satellite processing will cease in 2009, (3) It must be waterproof.  These PLBs will be used on fishing vessels in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.  Therefore, it is critical that they are designed to function in this environment, (4) It must float.  To avoid loss if it is dropped in the water.  Also, PLBs will not function if the antenna is entirely submerged, (5) It must have a GPS chip.  Adding GPS to a PLB results in a more accurate location.   It also allows instantaneous location and launch of search and rescue assets, and (6) The GPS must be both external and integrated.  An external GPS allows the operator to load location information prior to abandoning a vessel.  An integrated GPS allows the operator to acquire the GPS location from satellites after abandoning the vessel, which can take time.  It is critical that the PLB provides both options since an operator may not have time to load the location information before abandoning the vessel.

Performance Work Statement

1. SCOPE.  In this Phase II of the Video-Data-Optimization (V-D-O) initiative, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battlelab (UAVB) will integrate a server with video indexing software into a mock Ground Control Station (GCS) at the UAVB to demonstrate the functionality of video storage, indexing and retrieval based on H.264 encoding technology in mock operational client scenarios.

2. BACKGROUND.  During Phase I of V-D-O, the UAVB participated in a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) sponsored Predator demonstration at Gray Butte, CA on 22-24 FEB 06 to collect combined video and data streams via the H.264 codec, evaluating the improved compression rate and accessibility for military worth.

2.1. ENCODER/DECODER.  Delta Digital, under contract with NGA, provided a hardware video encoder to replace the Enerdyne encoder in the Predator UAV.  Sensor metadata, which was formerly burned-in to the video and also downlinked on a separate data stream, was encoded with the respective video frames in Key-Length-Value format for simultaneous and synchronous transmission via the H.264 encoder using MPEG-2 transport specifications.  At the receiving GCS, a Delta Digital video decoder provided viewable video to the operators with user-selectable metadata overlays.

2.2. STORAGE/RETRIEVAL.  Phase I demonstrated video storage and management software compatible with the transport and encoding technology described above on a USAF supplied media server and demonstrated video retrieval and playback software on a USAF supplied client workstation.  The software remained on the systems until completion of the evaluation.

2.2.1. PHASE I SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.  Video indexing and playback software system met the following criteria:

Must be H.264 compatible
Must provide FastVDO’s H.264 decoding
Separate video and flight data into optionally viewable, dual layer display
Offer Digital Video Recorder (DVR) type controls (pause, jog, fast-forward, rewind, etc.)

3. PHASE II DESCRIPTION.  This phase of the initiative is to demonstrate the synergistic value of combining a new generation of video compression & management tools for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in mock operational scenarios.  The UAVB will piggyback on NGA’s demonstration of H.264 encoding technology during Phase I for bundling and transmitting flight data as indexed data within the video footage, thus enabling easily searchable video archives of UAS missions.  The UAVB will demonstrate, through the addition of an archival and retrieval system, the broad area access to vital data & footage for warfighters, support units and analysts.

3.1. OBJECTIVES.

Demonstrate implementation of H.264 video compression scheme and storage packages
Demonstrate benefits of the alternate compression scheme
Demonstrate accessibility and ease of use of indexed video
Demonstrate accessibility of indexed video by network computers and handhelds
Demonstrate benefits of overlaid mission data
Establish viable standard for cross platform UAS video
Provide baseline for emerging video technologies i.e. High Definition (HD)

3.2. REQUIREMENTS.  Software for Phase II will include those listed in paragraph 2.2.1, plus the following:

Client software must be a popular Windows-based web browser plug-in (i.e. Internet Explorer)
Plug-in may come in several packages to best optimize the capabilities of users devices, should it be beneficial
Searchable fields must include all encoded metadata fields
Client must be able to generate snapshots with manual or auto generated tags
User generated annotation creation should include a dropdown auto tagging feature with preset QuickTags (customizable by user)
Default metadata overlay should replicate existing Predator video layout
Off-video metadata display should include the same fields as the on-video overlay, independently shown or hidden, in conjunction with the on-video display
Software will ultimately transcode to preset resolution and frame rates based on users indicated device type.  The contractor and UAVB Subject Matter Expert will determine acceptable presets.

3.3. CONTRACTOR SUPPORT.  Contractor will support the Phase II demonstration at the UAVB, Creech AFB NV, on or about 1-2 August 2006.  Contractor will provide requested modifications to software to support Phase II requirements. Contractor will also provide a software revision after the Phase II demonstration with reasonable modifications suggested by the demonstration evaluators (users).  

4. DELIVERABLES.

4.1. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT (GFE).  The UAVB will provide a fast Pentium IV media server running Windows XP for server software integration and a similar unit for client software integration.  At a minimum, the systems will be desktops with a processor clock greater than 3.0 GHz, 1 GB memory and at least 20 GB of storage.  UAVB will provide a handheld computer with specifications that are comparable to devices currently used in theatre.  The UAVB will retain the equipment after the demonstration.  Additionally, UAVB will provide an encoder as described in paragraph 2.1.

4.2. CONTRACTOR FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/SOFTWARE.  The contractor will install copies of management and client software on the above GFE, which will remain on the systems.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 effective May 19, 2006. The small business size standard is $23 million dollars. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has a requirement for a contractor to process the 2006 EEO-5 Survey Reports.  The EEOC contemplates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract. CLIN 0001. The contractor shall process the 2006 EEO-5 Survey Reports  - Quantity 1 Lot, Unit Price $________, Total for CLIN 0001 $________.  The EEO-5 survey is used to collect data by race/ethnic categories, gender, broad occupational categories,  by full time, part time, and new hire status, from all public elementary and secondary school districts with 100 or more employees.  The survey is conducted biennially in the even numbered calendar years. There are about 7,500 public elementary-secondary schools who meet the filing requirement in any one survey year. This survey is a joint requirement of the EEOC and the Office for Civil Rights and the National Center for Education Statistics of the Department of Education. All three agencies use the data collected on this survey for their respective equal employment opportunity programs. This survey is a compliance survey required by Federal Law and accompanying regulations of the above agencies. Appendix A contains the survey instruments: EEO-5 form (168A), and instruction booklets.  The 2004 EEO-5 survey was processed entirely under a commercial contract. The contractor developed an on line filing system which was very well received by the school districts. Over 95% of the districts used electronic filing in 2004. The contractor is required to complete all phases of the EEO-5 survey from beginning to end. EEOC will provide government furnished property and expects to receive the complete data results, in the form of a final statistical file containing all employment data from each school district which submitted data, actual images of the documents received, and the unused supplies.  Work to be performed: The contractor shall perform the following tasks: A. Mail out: In the 2006 survey, only the methods described below will be allowed as options for filing. 1. On -line web based filing - The contractor will be required to offer this system as the preferred method of filing. A “Foxpro” based on line system was developed and used to great advantage in the previous (2004) survey, the prospective contractor can use this system or develop its own.; 2. Data file diskettes or CDs - to be filed by the 12 states (These are the states who file for all of the districts in the state) as before. Specifications for the data file lay out are contained in Appendix - A; 3. Paper forms/computer printouts - In order to meet EEOC’s obligation under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, the Commission is trying to phase out this method of filing and to the extent possible it should be discouraged. However, it is a legitimate method available to those who cannot file using either method 1 or 2.  Filing method number 1 will have to be developed to mirror the form and filing directions set forth in the instruction booklet.  It must provide tracking, automatic editing, and warnings when the new data is significantly different from what it was the previous cycle so that respondent school districts can make corrections before the data is submitted to the Joint Reporting Committee.  Proper security measures will have to be developed so that no breach of confidentiality will occur, including generation of and transmission of the unique school district ID numbers and pass words.  This system has the ability to incorporate filing method 2. Data files must be able to be read into the system.;  B. Type of Mail Out: There are three different methods of mailing out  EEO-5 forms. The 2004 final mail file will be used to extract the mail file for the 2006 initial as well as subsequent mail outs, and for imprinting paper forms. 1. Direct states mail out  - See appendix B  for the states which fall into this category. In these states the forms, or other notifications of filing, are sent directly to the school districts who return completed forms to be processed by the Joint Reporting Committee. 2. Coordinated states mail out - See appendix- C  for a listing of these states. In these states forms or other notifications of filing, are also sent directly to the school districts as in 1 above, with the single exception of the state of Delaware where the school districts forms are mailed to the state coordinator who distributes them to the local districts, however the completed forms are returned to the state liaison officer who forwards them to the Joint Reporting Committee in all of these states. The liaison officer also follows up on non-respondents.  In the case of on line filers, the state liaison would be sent a copy of the on line filing by the district. The state liaison officer is also sent a list of the districts who have been mailed forms or other filing notification ( This is in effect a portion of the mail out log). 3. “Diskette/data file” states - See appendix- D  for a listing of states in this category. In these states the state education agency completes EEO-5 reports for each district in the state which meets the filing requirement and submits the data in a data file. See appendix - A for the record layout of these data files. No forms are mailed to any of the districts in these states.  The state education agency is mailed a notification of filing letter as part of the general mail out. The contractor shall propose a certification of data procedures that is acceptable by EEOC for those school districts that choose the on-line filing method. Note: Mail method 1 and 2 above include about 3,600 school districts (Form- equivalents). The Diskette/data file method includes approximately 3,900 districts (Form- equivalents).; C. 2006 Planned Mail out Procedure.; For direct mail and coordinated mail states, in an effort to emphasize the on line filing method, the initial mail out will consist of:1. Notification that the 2006 survey has commenced and provide the filing deadline., 2. Provide each school district with its unique EEO-5 ID number and pass word to access the on line filing system., 3. Advise the school districts of the other filing method options should they decide not use the on line filing method., 4. Provide instructions on how to request one of the other filing methods., 5. Provide EEO-5 filing instructions,  EEO-5 form , and specifications for filing a diskette data file as down loadable files.; D. Diskette/data file states - Provide survey notification including filing deadline, data file specifications, EEO-5 ID and password for use of up loading the data file directly should some of the states wish to do so.; E. Mail out supplies and quantities. The above initial mail out will consist of: 1. Survey notification letters - one page (front and back) - 3,613 (3,600 for direct and coordinated states plus 13 letters to the diskette/ data file states).; 2. Window business envelopes (4” x 9-1/2”) - 3,613.; 3. Postage for 3,613 letters.; 4. Printing the EEO-5 forms as they are requested by school districts. The maximum number of forms that would have to be printed is estimated to be no more than 1000. After the initial mail out the contractor must be prepared to respond to all those school districts who were mailed the initial survey notification but who desire to file either on the actual EEO-5 survey forms, computer print outs or on diskette/data file. Provisions must be made so that school districts can make this request by mail, e-mail, fax, or by downloading the required material from the website.; F. Mail out Control Logs. The contractor will provide three (3) copies of a mail out log for use in controlling the letters mailed out and for subsequent use in receipt and check in procedures and non response follow up mailings.; G. Mail out Reports. The initial mail out report must be submitted upon completion of the initial mail out. It must show the number of notices mailed to each of the different filing types. It must show the number of mailings by state and nation wide. Subsequent reports must be submitted on a weekly basis reporting the number of requests to file on one of the methods other than the on line system.; H. Receipt and Check In.  All EEO-5 mail will be received at a post office box, which the contractor is required to obtain and maintain during the length of the contract. Postmaster returns of the initial mail out must be resolved immediately by researching the addresses and if a better address can be found the letter must be re-mailed as soon as possible.  Postmaster returns are some time an indication that the school district may have undergone a merger, consolidation or closing. All survey returns received in the mail must be dated, logged in, and checked for completeness. Any correspondence received in the mail must have the unique identification number added and should be kept with the report to which it applies. Any non- routine correspondence (i.e., such as requests for special reporting procedures or requests for exemptions, congressional inquiries, etc) should be referred to EEOC immediately.; I. Manual Edits. The following are the required edits of all paper forms received: 1. Check for any changes to the pre-printed information such as - School district name, School district address, County name., 2. Indications of consolidation or closings., 3. Changes in type of agency which operates the district., 4. Check for the presence of the general statistics- number of schools and annexes operated by the district and presence of the October enrollment in the district., 5. Check and resolve any comments provided by the district in the remarks section of the form., 6. Check that the employment matrices contain only whole numbers, and that there are no factional entries or percentages., 7. Report should have data in all three matrices, i.e. full-time, part-time and new-hires., and 8. Check for the presence of a signature certifying the accuracy of the data.; J. Data Entry. All errors should be identified by the time the forms are ready to be keyed. It is important that all errors including matrix errors be identified as soon as possible so that if the school district needs to be contacted all discovered errors can be corrected with one contact, be that by phone, fax, e-mail, or letter. The data entry program should be designed to make all row and column checks to make certain that totals agree. Make sure that all address and other identifying information changes are keyed and verified.; K. Computer Edits. 1. Assign and verify that all FIPS county, state, and pmsa codes are correct., 2. All row and column totals equal the entries in the total columns, and the rows total, i.e. the sum of column A is equal to the sum of row 19., 3. The sum of rows 20 and 21 in column A is equal to the sum of columns B through K of row 22., 4. Check for the number of schools and the number of principals reported.  Generally there is only one principal for each school. If the above mentioned numbers are different, then an inquiry to the school district is required. On the average, there are .95 principles per school. Ratios 25% larger or smaller than this could be a flag of inconsistent reporting., 5. The overall ratio of school district enrollment to the number of classroom teachers, i.e. the sum of lines 5 and 6 on the full-time matrix,  is 20. Ratios which are either 50 % greater or less than this overall ratio should be questioned as it might point to reporting problems of either teachers or students. The above edits must be made on all school district data which is submitted as data files or which is submitted on-line.: L. Non - Response Procedure. 1. Thirty days after the filing deadline, a non-response notice will be mailed to all those school districts who have not submitted their EEO-5 data by any of the three filing methods. The notice will be prepared by EEOC and provided to the contractor for duplication and mail out., 2. A report containing all of those districts who are non - respondents at the end of the 30 days will be provided to EEOC for approval before the notices are mailed., 3. A second notice, using the same procedure as above, will be mailed 60 days after the filing deadline., and 4.A final notice will be mailed 90 days after the filing deadline.; M. Data base Development and Access. The data base shall contain all EEO-5 data no matter what method of filing was used to collect it. The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative shall have access to the data base as it is being built for monitoring purposes. The EEO-5 processing system has programs to retrieve data from the data base. This serves EEOC data disseminators in extracting reports for individual school districts, and state or national aggregates for dissemination to EEOC investigators, other government agencies, and the public. The contractor must expand this system to include (Participation - and Occupational distribution - rates) percentages, and if possible improve the layout of the retrieval formats.; N. Disposition of forms (form equivalents). The generated forms and computer printouts shall be imaged on CDs with retrieval capability to be used for data dissemination. After verification of the imaged data the contractor shall dispose of all paper filing documents. Diskettes and data files shall be provided to EEOC for use in data retrieval functions. Government Furnished Materials shall consist of the following: 1. 2004 final statistical file (diskette/CD) from which the 2006 mail file will be extracted, 2. EEO-5 form, 3. EEO-5 Instruction booklet, 4.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Request for Quotes, RFQ60035.  This RFQ is a small business set aside.    This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on the behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on competitive bases to provide assistance to the NIMH Neurodevelopmental Disorders Branch in the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development (DPTR) in providing interaction between the developmental research community and federal research programs.

Only firms that can provide the exact AquaFix 406 GPS I/O Personal EPIRB Model PLB-200 as described herein will be considered. 

7.0  Brand Name Justification:  The Personal Locator Beacons (PLB) transmits on 406 MHz via the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system with a unique, digitally coded distress signal and transmits a 121.5 MHz SAR homing signal.  This unit has all of the following unique characteristics which other PLBs to not have: (1) The unit must be a U.S. legal PLB or “FCC approved”.  The U.S. added two notable requirements to the international PLB standards.  PLBs that are not U.S. legal cannot be registered with NOAA, (2) It must have a 406 MHz distress beacon.  A 406 MHz distress beacon is more accurate than a 121.5 MHz beacon.  Also, the 121.5 MHz beacon does not have GPS capability and satellite processing will cease in 2009, (3) It must be waterproof.  These PLBs will be used on fishing vessels in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.  Therefore, it is critical that they are designed to function in this environment, (4) It must float.  To avoid loss if it is dropped in the water.  Also, PLBs will not function if the antenna is entirely submerged, (5) It must have a GPS chip.  Adding GPS to a PLB results in a more accurate location.   It also allows instantaneous location and launch of search and rescue assets, and (6) The GPS must be both external and integrated.  An external GPS allows the operator to load location information prior to abandoning a vessel.  An integrated GPS allows the operator to acquire the GPS location from satellites after abandoning the vessel, which can take time.  It is critical that the PLB provides both options since an operator may not have time to load the location information before abandoning the vessel.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation Number HSCG40-06-Q-41303. 1. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:  This is a justification for the procurement of various Caterpillar Parts, as a commercial item acquisition, utilizing other than full and open competition procedures.  The various Caterpillar Parts are for engine model numbers manufactured by Caterpillar Inc, and installed on Coast Guard vessels and application.  The Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center intends to solicit only Caterpillar Inc., and or their authorized distributors and repair facilities.  2.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The Coast Guard currently has a requirement these various Caterpillar parts in accordance with current OPEM specifications utilizing genuine OEM Parts.  The ELC anticipates awarding a firm fixed price type contract.  The quantities of the Caterpillar engine parts will be addressed in the Schedule of the solicitation package. 
“only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements”. 3. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Caterpillar Inc., is the only known company possessing the original drawings, specifications, engineering  control procedures and proprietary methods to ensure the latest design configuration, manufacturing and quality control required to produce parts to current engineering specifications and requirements. 4. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL SOURCES: Documentation available is not sufficient to provide for a competitive solicitation.  Caterpillar is not willing to sell the rights to its drawings and manufacturing data.  Caterpillar, Inc., the OEM of the parts, has proprietary rights to the  engineering drawings and specifications used to manufacture the parts.  Further, the scope of manufacturing special tools, and equipment required to manufacture the various parts are unknown.  5.  FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The Contracting Officer anticipates that the  cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon established catalog pricing and competition amongst their authorized distributors.  FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  There are no known appropriate substitute parts for Caterpillar engine parts.

<ARCHDATE>06202007
<CONTACT>Joseph R. Gatlin Contract Specialist -A/OPC 3039692660     Joseph_Gatlin@nps.gov;
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation that was originally submitted as Q1320061176.  This solicitation is an amendment to the original solicitation, due to the high volume of questions concerning the wood preservative treatment.  The due date for proposals has been extended through 2pm, Friday, June 30, 2006.  The anticipated award date has been extended to July 14, 2006.  Inquiries may be made to Joe Gatlin at joseph_gatlin@nps.gov, ph 303-969-2660 through June 23, 2006.   After that date inquiries should be addressed to Keith Biermann at keith_biermann@nps.gov, ph 406-666-3310. The original solicitation item "C" is generic in terms of not specifying a specific brand of chemical for wood preservative treatment or a specific brand of wood product for the end material.  There are several new chemical materials being made to replace the older CCA type products for purposes of exterior wood preservative.  The newer CA (Azoles) and ACQ (Quats) products do not contain the arsenic compounds, but are corrosive for the application of replacing decking on steel dock structural frames with numerous fasteners.  We are aware of a chemical treatment being used on the East coast and southern states that uses Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (DOT) with a polymer binder that is applicable for exterior decking.  The product is also available with a 20 to 40 year warranty, depending upon application and original owner criteria.  It is also applicable for use in accordance with APWA C2, C31, C9, U1, P5, and ICC-AC62.  Most common borate preservative treatments are available for indoor use or locations protected from exterior weather elements.  This is due to the leaching of the borate preservative, if used outside without being protected from exposure to the weather.  There is a chemical preservative and wood product available that is made with (DOT) and a polymer binder for dock and decking applications.  As a result of this solicitation, we are now also aware of another chemical treatment and product that also meets the NPS specification item C, which does not use DOT, but still contains no arsenicals or heavy metals.  This treatment uses sodium silicate for the product preservative.  If we receive a proposal from an offerer that submits lumber materials that use these preservatives, then their offers will be considered better in meeting item C of the complete NPS specification instead of products that use CA, CAB, ACQ, CCA, etc.  Products using CCA are the least desirable for our application and will not meet specification item C.  Products using CA, ACQ, etc, will be evaluated using the NPS specification items A through L, and would probably not meet the specification.    All products submitted will be evaluated based on the criteria items A through L. Lumber products treated with DOT, but without the polymer binder would be less desirable that products treated with copper azole (CA) or Achromium Copper Quaternary ACQ (quats).  However, CA or ACQ treated products would be less desirable than products treated with DOT and polymer binder, due to the higher corrosion factor of the CA and ACQ products.   The chemical treatment process for the TimberSil brand, EnviroSafe Plus Brand, or other brands without Arsenic or heavy metals meet the spec requirement for specification item C.  Although the chemical wood preservative used for TimberSil is not (DOT), it does not contain arsenicals or hazardous heavy metals.  The sodium silicate treatment is an acceptable alternative according to the NPS material specification item C.  It appears that the treatment process infuses the chemical throughout the wood but the information provided on the website pages is not clear about treatment process as either being a surface treatment or something similar to pressure treatment, as required by the NPS specification item A.   All proposals must include adequate product data sheets, manufacturer's warranties, copies of labels or certifications, or other information to be used in comparing and evaluating all proposals for this offer based against the NPS specification items.   ORIGINAL SOLICITATION (1)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format stated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
