<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Contracting Officer 7037871263     Sharon.Teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  Pursuant to this Broad Agency Announcement (FAR 35.016), the Department to the Interior, Minerals Management Services, solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Environmental Studies Program (ESP). This initiative is entitled "Review of studies on interactions between spilled oil and shorelines". The MMS web sites for ESP have descriptions of past ESP projects. The web site address is http://www.mms.gov/eppd/sciences/esp/. BACKGROUND: The Minerals Management Service recognizes the importance of understanding the interactions of spilled oil with shorelines. The shoreline materials may include sediment, gravel, rock, mud, etc. Accurate description of the interactions in the nearshore areas is essential for oil spill risk analysis (OSRA) studies. Since many environmental resources in OSRA analysis are located along and/or near the coasts, MMS needs to accurately estimate the rates of the spilled oil entrained on the shorelines, especially on the sediment beaches. Representation of the oil-shoreline interaction should be considered as a component of the entire simulation of the evolution of oil spills in the coasts.  OBJECTIVES: MMS is seeking white papers to increase the understanding of physical interaction of spilled oil with sediment beach particles. MMS requests that the white paper addresses a review of the state-of-the-art of spilled oil interactions with sediments on beaches and identifies information gaps in this state. HOW TO RESPOND:  ONLY WHITE PAPERS ARE BEING REQUESTED; DO NOT SUBMIT TECHNICAL OR BUSINESS PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposal(s) shall be requested. The MMS anticipates a total of $35,000 to $50,000 may be available for this study. NOTICE: The MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review. Potential contractors shall notify the MMS if they do not want their white papers/proposals shared. White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, Attn:  Sharon Teger, 381 Elden St., Mail Stop 2101, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, not later than July 19, 2006 at 04:00 PM, EDT. WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED. White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort. NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL SHALL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY. The MMS shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the technical and cost/business proposal. This announcement solicits white papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award. Respondents SHALL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) understanding of the technical issues; (2) feasibility of the approach or solution; (3) innovative or creative approaches or solutions; (4) past performance and experience.  QUESTIONS shall be E-mailed to Sharon.Teger@mms.gov . The reference number 1435-01-06-AN-39742 MUST be in the subject line of the E-mail and include your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service intends to make an award to Northwest Marine Technology for the purchase of one T-13 diverter gate in the amount of $24,900 to be mounted on an existing T13 tunnel detector located at Spring Creek National Fish Hatchery. Tunnel detectors are used for adult spawning to detect adult salmon.  Each detector is 6' long, 2' wide, and 2' tall.  Northwest Marine Technology has been an innovative and responsive industry leader in this field for many years.  Its equipment has consistently fulfilled our requirements. The Fisheries Program, Region 1, began implementation in Fiscal year 2004, Congressional legislation that mandates mass marking of hatchery fish that are produced for the purpose of harvest.  The items being acquired under this justification are components that assist with this mandated marking.  They are compatible with equipment purchased to date and can be serviced and maintained by Northwest Marine Technology.  Questions should be directed to Linda Askew at 503-736-4498.

The evaluation factors for award are technical capability to meet the requirements of the RFQ, price and past performance, with technical capability and past performance of equal importance, and each individually more important than price. Past Performance factor: The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

Year 2000 compliant means information technology that accurately processes date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing and sequencing) from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000 and leap year calculations. Furthermore, Year 2000 compliant information technology, when used in conjunction with other information technology, shall accurately process date/time data if the other information technology properly exchanges date/time data with it.

<DESC>GRCA Maintenance of Backcountry Toilets - NAICS 221320 This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).   The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback regarding the development of the acquisition strategy and request for proposal to maintain composting toilets within Grand Canyon National Park.  The purpose of the acquisition is to maintain up to eleven aboveground vault composting toilets within Grand Canyon National Park in a manner that will ensure the health and general well-being of visitors, national park staff and the contractor's employees.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The contractor shall provide all management, licenses, labor, equipment, tools, supplies, and transportation to provide waste removal from selected backcountry composing toilets within the Grand Canyon in a manner that will ensure the health and general well being of visitors, national park staff and the contractor's employees. The contractor will need to comply with all applicable federal, state and local standards, including licensing by the State and County as a septic pumper/hauler as may be required. The contractor will provide annual waste removal for up to eleven aboveground vault composting toilets located within primitive areas of the Grand Canyon not accessible by livestock. The work involves the removal of composted waste from the toilet, repair of the facilities if necessary, and re-supply of wood chips, enzymes or other composting materials.  This work is currently accomplished by use of helicopters and NPS staff.   In consideration of the location of these facilities in proposed wilderness, the NPS is looking for solutions from contractors to remove waste from the backcountry toilets by back-packing and/or boating waste out of the inner canyon.  The NPS is open to other methods of waste removal as well.  The NPS will consider business plans on an experimental basis.  The NPS is interested in the potential reduction of impacts to the proposed wilderness.   The evaluation will focus on the following aspects of the operation: 1)  Impacts or benefits to the proposed wilderness, park visitors, and park operations, specifically river and backcountry operations. 2)  Safety, health, and experience of park visitors, park staff, and contractor employees. 3)  Cost effectiveness as measured against other collection and disposal alternatives.  A more complete background of the history, setting and management issues to be resolved through this contract is provided in the Environmental Assessment/Assessment of Effect: Replacement, Rehabilitation, and Maintenance of Backcountry and Corridor Toilets (March 2003).  This document can be located on-line at http://www.nps.gov/grca/compliance/bcktry-toilets.htm  or may be obtained by writing to the Superintendent, Grand Canyon National Park, PO Box 129, Grand Canyon, Arizona 86023. BASIC SERVICES: The toilets and facilities to be serviced are Romtec above ground vaults with a wood privacy screen attached to each unit.  The content weights may vary from 100 - 750 pounds depending on the frequency of waste removal, frequency of visitor use, and dryness of the compost.  The NPS proposes that composted waste be removed on at least an annual basis, prior to the beginning of the spring hiking season The backcountry toilets are currently located as follows: Horseshoe Mesa (2)			 Monument Creek Upper Tapeats Tanner Deer Creek Clear Creek Salt Creek Horn Creek Hermit Creek Waldron (Hermit) Basin SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:  The NPS proposes that as an alternative to helicopter use in a proposed wilderness area, that toilets be shoveled out on-site, waste transferred to sealable portable containers, and packed out to the rim via backpack or backpacked to the river and transported by boat, or by another method recommended by the contractor.  The containers for removal of the composted effluent must be tight sealing and easily cleanable containers capable of maintaining all waste in the container and not emitting an odor. The container should also have rounded interior corners to aid in cleaning. Should the contractor propose to use boats on the Colorado River, all such use must conform to the rules and regulations for administrative use exercised by the NPS.  Operations conducted by overnight backpacking must also conform the park's rules for administrative use.  The composted effluent from the backcountry toilets is currently disposed of at the wastewater treatment plant at the Grand Canyon Village.  The contractor may either reach an agreement with the NPS to continue disposal at Grand Canyon Village, or make another arrangement that complies with law and regulation.  The contractor must also conform to all applicable regulations promulgated by authorities having jurisdiction over the handling and disposal of human waste, including but not limited to the United States Public Health Service and the State of Arizona Department of Health.  ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:  The purpose of this RFI is to gain market research in order to determine the best methods available, in order to formulate the proper acquisition strategy.  TERM:  The NPS intends to issue a contract for a single season, renewable for four additional seasons provided the contractor can demonstrate that the work can be performed with minimal impact to park resources and can stay within acceptable use parameters to safeguard people, park resources, and wilderness. The NPS will provide on-site monitoring and evaluate the contractor's performance the first season and make a determination on award of subsequent seasons based upon its written evaluation. SUBMITTAL:  If interested, please submit a summary business plan, which addresses the needs identified above.  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Responses to this RFI should be in a Word.doc, not to exceed twenty (20) pages.  Responses should be submitted, via e-mail, to Katie Hoover at the following address katie_hoover@nps.gov or via fax at 303-969-2222.  Responses must be submitted no later than, July 17th 2006.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for one Multi-component, Multiplexing Tunable Diode Laser Absorption System.   NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Zolo Technologies. The critical technology employed by Zolo is the fiber-coupled optical multiplexer.  This Zolo-proprietary (patented) technology allows several laser wavelengths to be carried over a single optical fiber with acceptably small insertion loss.  This is a critical requirement for the arc jet application, since the arc jet heater design allows for only a single optical path.  The high efficiency, compact, fiber-coupled multiplexer is an enabling technology for this application.  The multiplexer is the result of several years of telecom venture capital investment and would be cost-prohibitive to procure as a separate item. Statement of Work Design, verify, and install a diagnostic system to detect, measure, and record the path-averaged temperature and concentrations of atomic copper and atomic oxygen in the add-air plenum region of the Ames 60-MW IHF arcjet facility, for a single line of sight, during normal test operations.	Conduct engineering research to identify lasers, optics, and control systems.  Collaborate with NASA engineering staff to design and fabricate facility optical interfaces and interface attachment hardware.	Modify control software to report temperature with +/- 10% precision and report atom concentration with +/-15% precision, at a data rate exceeding 0.5 Hz.  Typical operating conditions and signal levels are detailed in the Stanford University thesis “Development of Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Sensors for a Large-scale Arc-heated Plasma Wind Tunnel”.  The path length is approximately 10 cm. Requirements Data must be measured for all species simultaneously.  The system must be field-upgradeable for simultaneous multiplexed operation on additional atomic and molecular species (up to six total species plus temperature) without increasing the number of existing optical access ports or existing lines of sight. The system must process the data automatically for immediate assessment during facility operation or post-test review.	The system must preserve sufficient raw data (wavelength integrated absorption and periodic full line shape samples) to allow post-test quality assessment of processed data.   The system must not interfere with the normal operation of the facility.  The system must not alter the plenum environment.  The system must not alter the electrical or cooling requirements of the facility.  The system must not require intervention by facility operations personnel.  The system control logic must be compatible with the existing facility data acquisition system. Laser light and signal beams must be carried to and from the facility interface with a minimum transmission length of ten meters.  The lasers must be fiber-coupled to the facility interfaces.  Free-space optical transmission of laser or signal beams within ten meters of the interfaces is not acceptable.  The interface hardware must be compatible with existing plenum hardware and lines of sight.  The interfaces must be removable by facility personnel using common hand tools.  Fiber optic lines must be electrically non-conducting.  The lasers must operate with facility safety interlocks.  All optical-facility interface hardware designs are subject to NASA approval prior to fabrication or installation.   Electrical power will be supplied as 120 VAC/60 Hz.  Laser generation and detection hardware must be completely contained in a standard instrumentation rack no greater than 6 feet tall.  Free-space transmission of laser or signal beams outside the space defined by the rack is not acceptable.	The instrumentation rack must be on rollers or casters.  The instrumentation rack must be capable of being disconnected from the optical fibers and stored, daily, with no degradation of system performance when re-connected. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 12, 2006 to Christine M. Benavides at cbenavides@mail.arc.nasa.gov .  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00164.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.   STATEMENT OF WORK Title:   Provide data  from toxicological studies of fuels/fuel additives (alcohols and ethers) to be used in EPA health assessments.   Program Office: ORD/NCEA-RTP Period of Performance:  12 months from date of award Estimated Hours/Level of Effort:  2,930 hours BACKGROUND: Various alcohols and ethers have been used  or considered as fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) in an attempt to formulate "cleaner" gasoline in an effort to reduce levels of carbon monoxide, ozone, and toxic air pollutants.  Although the purpose of these F/FAs is to reduce air pollution levels, such chemicals need to be evaluated for their  own potential toxicity under certain conditions.  Thus, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is interested in compiling health effects information on F/FAs such as DIPE (di-isopropyl ether), ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether), EtOH (ethanol), MeOH (methanol), MTBE (methyl tertiary  butyl ether), TAME (tertiary amyl methyl ether), and TBA (tert butanol).  Health assessments of some of these chemicals (MTBE, ETBE, EtOH, MeOH) are underway for the U.S. EPA's IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) program, and Section 1506 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 further reinforces  the need to evaluate such F/FAs.   The number of published toxicological studies of F/FA chemicals varies widely.  For example, ethanol has been investigated extensively whereas DIPE has not.  Even a well-studied substance such as ethanol may have been investigated primarily by one route  (ingestion) whereas other routes (e.g., inhalation) may be more relevant to F/FA use and likely exposure pathways.  Under Section 211(b) of the Clean Air Act, the U.S. EPA has exercised its authority to require manufacturers of several of the above-named F/FAs to conduct toxicological testing of  mixtures of these respective alcohols or ethers with baseline gasoline, using the inhalation route of exposure.  Although the U.S. EPA's authority to require such testing under CAA 211(b) is limited to the inhalation route, other routes, especially ingestion, are also of importance in attempting to  understand the broad environmental and health implications of these F/FAs.  Peer-reviewed, published reports of health studies are preferred for use in U.S. EPA health assessments, but such reports may not provide as much information as desired or necessary for modeling and other analyses used in  health assessments.  For example, data on effects in individual animals may be needed for analytic purposes, but published reports often do not include this level of detail.  Unpublished data may also be used in assessments so long as the data are available in a manner that can be subjected to peer  review in the context of the assessment's preparation.  There is reason to think that researchers and research organizations in the scientific community have detailed data from studies that could be useful for U.S. EPA assessments of F/FAs.  In some cases, these data may have been the subject of  published reports, but in other cases the data may come from studies that have not yet been reported in the published literature.  In the latter instance, studies may be in various stages of completion.   This requirement is not intended to fund the initiation of new experimental studies, nor is  it intended to obtain information that has already been fully reported in accessible publications.  Rather, this requirement seeks to obtain unpublished data from existing studies that have been completed, at a minimum, experimental exposures and collection of "raw" effects data.  For example,  tissues from selected target organs may have been collected from laboratory animals exposed to F/FA chemicals in toxicological experiments.  Under this requirement, pathological evaluations of tissues could be conducted, along with statistical analyses of the data.  Ancillary data on individual  experimental animals, including food and water consumption, body weights, time until death, and similar information, would also be required.  Potential offerors should indicate the nature and extent of data available, including the specific chemical(s) and route(s) of exposure; the chemical  concentrations administered; the number, gender, age and species of animals for each exposed and control group; detailed descriptions of the endpoints examined and/or quantified (e.g., tumor sites, number and classification of tumors); the statistical analyses completed or planned; the relationship  of the data to any previously published report(s) on the same chemical from the laboratory in question; and any other information, including provisions for quality control/assurance, that would help the U.S. EPA determine the utility of the data for health assessment purposes.   Successful  offerors shall retain possession of their data and the right to publish reports referring to such data.  Procurement or consideration of an offeror's data shall not imply an endorsement of the study by the U.S. EPA. Tasks Task 1:   After award of a purchase order, the contractor shall be required  to develop a Joint Quality Management/Quality Assurance Project Plan (JQM/QAPP), specifying how the data will be compiled, evaluated, statistically analyzed, reported, and transferred in electronic format.  The QAPP shall address at a minimum the topics listed in the QA attachment   The QAPP shall  be submitted to the US EPA Project Officer for approval within four (4) weeks of receiving award of the purchase order.  The intent of the JQM/QAPP is to ensure that the data, data analysis, and reporting of the results are of acceptable quality and support reconstruction of the conduct of the  study by outside review.   The requirements in QA attachments, "EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans" (http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r2-final.pdf) and "EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans" (http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r5-final.pdf) shall be followed.   Task 2:    The contractor shall prepare a report that includes a detailed description of the experimental methods (including information on the dose regimen for chemical administered, the experimental subjects, the endpoints measured), QA procedures (see Subtasks 1-8 below), data handling procedures,  statistical analyses, and results, along with a narrative description and discussion of the results.  This information is expected to be more detailed than typically provided in journal articles or similar publications of comparable experimental studies.  The report shall be accompanied by the  complete dataset in an acceptable electronic format (e.g., Excel, Lotus 123) as an appendix to the report.  The dataset shall include identifiers for individual animals, their respective experimental condition/group, food consumption (if available) and body weight data, qualitative and quantitative  data on toxicological endpoints measured (e.g., number and type of tumors), time of death, and any other available relevant information.  Subtasks 1-7  1. The contractor shall describe all procedures and methods that will be used in the data collection effort and how they will be documented.  The  contract shall also indicate whether the data collection will be carried out in a certified environment, such as a GLP accredited lab, and under generally accepted, citable protocols, including those dealing with the humane care of experimental animals. 2. The contractor shall identify how study  records (e.g., methods, data, supporting documentation) are maintained (including where and how this documentation and the data record will be provided to the U.S. EPA). 3.

The Grantee (The Nigerian Stock Exchange) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance program to assist in the development of a disaster recovery plan for the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).

NSE requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) assistance to a disaster recovery plan which will provide a mechanism for continuous trading and support of the NSE in case of failure of the main building or main equipment and ensure that the data stored and transferred on the NSE’s hardware and communications infrastructure is fully recoverable and secure.  The Technical Assistance consultant would review existing IT systems and plans, existing hardware and communications infrastructure, and would develop a strategic plan, specifications, and an implementation plan for a disaster recovery facility.  The Technical Assistance would ensure that any recommended procurements can be integrated with existing hardware, communications infrastructure, applications, and databases.  The NSE would also like to use this Technical Assistance to obtain “Security, Reliability, and Data Integrity” certification of the exchange.  The NSE currently does not have a full accounting of its security-related infrastructure.  This Technical Assistance would identify existing physical and IT infrastructure security operations and gaps at the NSE, and develop a strategic plan for security at the disaster recovery facility.

•	Review Existing IT Systems and Plans

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to negotiate two Engineering Change Proposals resulting from contract N68335-99-C-0167 with Hydraulics International Inc of Chatsworth, CA on a sole source basis. 

One ECP will re-design the Chain Tensioner Assembly of the Linkless Ammunition Loading System (LALS). This redesign would reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs and extend the lifespan of key components inside the LALS. 

The second ECP will re-design the Aircraft Interface Unit of the LALs to improve reliability and maintainability.

In addition to the non recurring engineering effort, the government anticipates buying two first article test units and five hundred and forty five of each assembly / kit to upgrade existing US Navy and USAF 20mm Linkless Ammunition Loading Systems.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey (OCS), has a requirement for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to perform rapid-response hydrographic-quality side scan sonar survey of port areas.  OCS requires an AUV that could be deployed in conjunction with manned surface assets to provide a rapid response capability for underwater domain awareness of ports, harbors, and inland waterways.  NOAA has a manned surface capability consisting of a 29-foot hydrographic survey launch equipped with multibeam and side scan sonar.  The survey launch is operated by a two or three person crew.  The operational concept is to use the AUV to augment the capability of the manned surface vessel to detect and map cubic features as small as 30 centimeters in water depths up to 100 meters.  The AUV would be deployed to perform baseline surveys, investigate targets in areas previously surveyed by the surface vessel or other resource, or survey potentially dangerous areas.  The autonomous vehicle will be operated by the crew of the survey launch with minimal or no shore-based support facilities.  The goals of using an AUV are, primarily, to provide standoff capabilities for the safety of the manned assets, and, secondarily, to increase survey efficiency and coverage.  

The technical requirements of AUV are detailed in the attached Statement of Work, Autonomous Hydrographic Survey Vehicle, dated June 21, 2006.  This requirement is set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334511 and the applicable size standard is 750 employees.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the qualified responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of this solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.    Award will be based on an integrated assessment of offers using all evaluation factors.  If an award is made, it will be to the responsible Contractor that offers the best value to the Government.  The evaluation factors, although relatively equal, are listed in order of importance:    
•	Approach – The likelihood of effectively meeting requirements
•	Past Performance – The relevance and quality of prior performance
•	Price – The amount, realism, and consistency of the evaluated price

An adjectival method will be used to rate each factor:
•	Outstanding – Clearly demonstrates the full scope of the requirement for a comprehensive system solution
•	Good – Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid
•	Adequate – Reasonably sufficient and suitable
•	Marginal – Minimally suitable at the lower limit
•	Unsatisfactory – Not sufficient, not enough, disappointing

Responses must be sent electronically in MS Word format to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov and in paper to Pauline Jaffe, Contract Specialist, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, Suite 7608, SSMC4, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, no later than 11:00 am, local time, on July 10, 2006.  The applicable terms and conditions for the resulting purchase order are current through FAC 2005-09 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Interested contractors are hereby advised that contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Please register with CCR at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov.  Questions regarding this requirement shall be submitted electronically to Pauline.Jaffe@noaa.gov.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the Regents of the University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) for the requirement of the Autism Phenome Pilot Project under the NIMH Project entitled Clinical and Immunological Investigation of Regression in Autism.  The current investigation will focus on the interrelationship between regression in autism and immune dysfunction.

Children of both sexes with autism spectrum disorder will be compared and contrasted with children with developmental delays but not autism.  The

The University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) maintains clinical and biomedical infrastructure to carry out many component processes of the Autism Phenome Pilot Project.  The University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) has an affiliation with the CHARGE study which is already recruiting children with autism, children with developmental delays, and healthy children on a population-based sample.  The sample will allow initial pilot data in a short time frame.  The University of California (M.I.N.D. Institute) will provide the services of a research psychologist.

An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research involving the recruitment and evaluation of very young child with autism and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.     

Period of Performance will be 12 months. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million. 

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>B -- RESEARCH ON SMALL BUSINESS BENEFITS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0008
<RESPDATE>072706
<ARCHDATE>07272006
<CONTACT>Maria Manga, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 205-7036, Fax (202) 481-4324, Email maria.manga@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
In August 2005, the Office of Advocacy released a study on small business benefits that reached the following conclusion (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs224tot.pdf): 

Employees of small businesses have access to fewer benefits than do the employees of large businesses. Small and large businesses continue to provide benefits to their employees, but at a declining rate. Companies of all sizes have reduced the availability of health insurance to their employees due to the increasing cost associated with benefits in recent years. Access to retirement benefits is more prevalent among large firms than among small firms.

The Office of Advocacy has conducted many studies on this topic (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/wages.html). Small firms continue to be squeezed by higher health insurance premiums, as evidenced by annual surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation (http://www.kff.org/insurance/7315/index.cfm), and small business owners continue to cite the cost and availability of insurance as the single most important problem that they face in the monthly Small Business Economic Trends published by the National Federation of Independent Business (for more information, see http://www.nfib.com/page/researchFoundation). Firms have reacted to rising health care costs in different ways.  Many are beginning to offer high deductible health plans (HDHP) coupled with a health savings account (HSA) as a method of using consumer-driven options to control costs.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more large firms than small firms are the early adopters of these HDHP’s and HSA's, which were created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Because these types of plans are relatively new, data are just beginning to emerge on their usage.  (Another source of information on these and other plans is America’s Health Insurance Plans, which can be found at http://www.ahipresearch.org.) 

In terms of retirement plans, small firms are more likely to have defined-contribution versus defined-benefit plans. Yet, rising health care costs can mean that some small business owners must choose between providing their workers with health insurance or making contributions to their employee’s retirement savings plan. Providing such benefits can be essential to attracting qualified workers, especially as these smaller entities compete for labor with their larger counterparts.

The Office of Advocacy seeks additional research in the area of small business benefits. Proposals could focus on health care, retirement, or some other form of employee compensation or benefit, and they should focus on data sources that contain firm-size information. (This is preferable to establishment-size data.)  Possible data sources include, but are not limited to: the Current Population Survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (maria.manga@sba.gov). Fax or email proposals will not be accepted. Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions. NOTE:THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- ANTITRUST AND SMALL BUSINESS RESEARCH
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0009
<RESPDATE>072706
<ARCHDATE>07272006
<CONTACT>Maria Manga, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 205-7036, Fax (202) 481-4324, Email maria.manga@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:  
Small/new businesses are an integral component to the U.S. competitive marketplace.  Antitrust laws strive to allow for competition.  Advocacy seeks research to evaluate how the application of antitrust laws, mergers and/or court cases has affected small businesses and potential entrants in the past decade or so.

One avenue of study could be creating a competition/concentration of industry model with mergers/antitrust court cases as dependent variable(s).  Other avenues of study include creating an entrant or small business performance model with mergers/antitrust court cases as dependent variable(s) or modeling the impact of a specific antitrust case on small businesses.  Note that the models will need to capture the “natural” evolutions of industries, such as controlling for technological changes and demand for goods and services.  (Researchers will need to show their proficiency in creating econometric models and familiarity with the data presented in their proposals.)

The proposals need to specify the data and models to be used for the scientific research sought.  In addition to others, firm size data from the U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/data.html),  firm size data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/bdm/home.htm) or information on publicly traded companies that track large publicly traded company characteristics or initial public offerings by industry are options.   Information from the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), such as FTC’s “Horizontal Merger Investigation Data, Fiscal Years 1996-2003” http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/02/horizmerger.htm could help guide proposals. 
 
The study could focus on the entire economy or a few select industries.  If individual industries are to be studied, overall findings should be applicable to other portions of the economy. 

As a side note, the federal government is showing interest in refreshing antitrust laws.  Legislation in 2002 created the “Antitrust Modernization Commission” (http://www.amc.gov/) to examine and solicit input into antitrust laws.  Work groups and meetings are currently being held and a report from this group is expected in mid-2007.

Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (maria.manga@sba.gov).     Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.     Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.     NOTE:     THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- THE IMPACT OF ENERGY PRICES ON SMALL BUSINESS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0010
<RESPDATE>072706
<ARCHDATE>07272006
<CONTACT>Maria Manga, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 205-7036, Fax (202) 481-4324, Email maria.manga@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
Small businesses that rely heavily upon energy inputs are in a particularly difficult position when energy prices increase sharply, at least when compared to their larger counterparts.  Small firms generally do not have the economies of scale to ameliorate the costs of inputs that are at least somewhat fixed, such as electricity for plant operations or fuel for deliveries.  Thus when energy prices rise, small businesses face decreasing profits and increasing uncertainty.

Because of rising world demand, sustained increases in energy prices, including gas, natural gas, and electricity, are expected to prevail into the foreseeable future and small businesses will be forced to confront this issue.  Regardless of industry, energy prices have some impact on a firm’s costs.  However, some industries will be impacted to a greater extent than others, and small businesses are not equally distributed across industries.  This research should address these issues in determining what impact elevated energy prices will have on small business.  Geographic differences in energy prices will also be important, especially with regard to electricity and natural gas.  The effects of government regulation, both of the energy markets directly and through environmental requirements, might also be considered as important factors driving small business impacts, especially with respect to geographic differences.

The Office of Advocacy seeks research proposals to study the effect of rising energy prices on small business.  A proposal should carefully document the methodology and data to be employed in the investigation.  Preference will be given to proposals with a clear research agenda, familiarity with both small business economics and the energy sector, and well documented policy relevance.
Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (maria.manga@sba.gov).     Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.     Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.     NOTE:     THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institutes of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis with Science Daily, LLC, 14904 Talking Rock CT., North Potomac, MD  20878.  The period of performance is for one year period.  NIGMS requires a contractor to support Web site troubleshooting and enhancements.  Specifically, the work to be performed includes, but is not limited to:
•	Maintain and develop in ASP and other languages, including Javascript, XML, and XSLT, scripts on the NIGMS Web sites (such as the publications ordering system, the funding opportunities directory, and the Google site search).
•	Develop new Web-based applications that interact with NIH databases.
•	Improve existing Web material and functionality of the site to ensure that the best, most current technologies and practices are implemented, as appropriate, on the NIGMS Web site.
•	Troubleshoot and resolve problems that may arise on the site.
•	Interact with technical, scientific, communications, and managerial staff and contractors at NIGMS and NIH, particularly CIT, to facilitate the work on the site and to assist NIGMS staff in developing content for the site.  These interactions may be in person, by telephone, or via e-mail.
•	Participate in meetings at OCPL, NIGMS, and NIH and attend meetings such as the NIH Web Authors Group (WAG), NIH Web Interest Group (WIG), CMS Users Group, American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey meetings, and meetings with CIT and report back to NIGMS staff as appropriate.   
•	Evaluate and recommend relevant Web design, development, and management software, hardware, and other products or services.  
This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However all quotes received within ten (10) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>*****************Additional Q&A data and answers: ******************************************************************

(1) 6-DOF Research Grade Balance 


*	Balance Type -- Is this an internal single piece sting type? 



Yes


*	Balance Front End Type -- Cylindrical? 



Cylindrical with some sort of taper and pin attachment or recommend a model attachment configuration. We prefer to have both balances with the same attachment configuration. Since we don't have any models to mount at this time, we are open to mounting configuration suggestions.


*	Balance Back End Type -- Taper? 



We don't have any existing equipment at this point to attach the balances to so we are open to recommendations. We anticipate some kind of taper attachment or another configuration that provides a rigid mount.


*	Diameter = 0.750 inch 



The smallest diameter possible to provide the performance required with a safety factor of at least 2 at the monitored sections.


*	Length? 



We didn't specify a balance length as we intended to allow flexibility in design for the balance, model mount and overall sting arrangement. We anticipate the selected vendor will propose a design that will allow maximum model-to-support distance in order to minimize aerodynamic wall interference while the model is yawed.


*	Full scale loads @ Balance Moment Center NF=250, AF=30, PM=300,
RM=150, YM=150, SF=75 



Yes. 


*	Resultant Standard Deviation Error (%of FS) NF=0.10, AF=0.10,
PM=0.10, RM=0.25, YM=0.10, SF=0.10 



NF=+/- .05-.10%, AF=+/- .05-.10%, PM=+/- .05-.10%, RM=+/- .10-.25%,
YM=+/- .05-.10%, SF=+/- .05-.10%


*	Failure Safety Factor -- The Internal Balance will be designed
using Von Mises Theory. The maximum stresses will be calculated using Pro-Mechanica Finite Element Analysis Software. The Balance will have a safety factor of 1.5 to 2 based on the ultimate strength of the material. 



We prefer a minimum safety factor of at least 2.0 at the balance monitored sections, but we will consider any value proposed. 


*	Balance Calibration Matrix -- We will propose a 6X27 calibration
matrix instead of the modified 6X39. 



Ok. 


.(1) 3-DOF Student Grade Balance 


*	Balance Type -- Is this an internal single piece sting type? 



Yes. 


*	Balance Front End Type -- Cylindrical? 



Cylindrical with some sort of taper and pin attachment or recommend a model attachment configuration. We prefer to have both balances with the same attachment configuration. Since we don't have any models to mount at this time, we are open to mounting configuration suggestions.


*	Balance Back End Type -- Taper? 



We don't have any existing equipment at this point to attach the balances to so we are open to your recommendations. We anticipate some kind of taper attachment or another configuration that provides a tight and rigid mount. 


*	Diameter = 0.750 inch 



The smallest diameter possible to provide the performance required with a safety factor of at least 2 at the monitored sections.

Yes.


*	Resultant Standard Deviation Error (%of FS) NF=0.50, AF=0.10,
PM=0..50 



NF=+/-0.50%, AF=+/-.05-0.10%, PM=+/-.50% 


*	Failure Safety Factor -- The Internal Balance will be designed
using Von Mises Theory. The maximum stresses will be calculated using Pro-Mechanica Finite Element Analysis Software. The Balance will have a safety factor of 1.5 to 2 based on the ultimate strength of the material. 



We prefer a minimum safety factor of at least 2.0 at the balance monitored sections, but we will consider any value proposed. 


*	Balance Calibration Matrix -- We will propose a 3X9 calibration
matrix. 



Ok.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for operation of the National SEMAA Office. The NASA Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Aerospace Academy (SEMAA) project was established in 1993, as a joint venture between the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Cuyahoga Community College (CCC).  Since then, the NASA SEMAA project has grown from a single site to a nationally renowned leader in the efforts to increase the participation of historically underserved K-12 youth in the areas of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).	  The goals of the NASA SEMAA project are to inspire a more diverse population of students to pursue careers in STEM, engage students, teachers and adult family members by incorporating emerging technologies into the project, and provide a challenging curriculum that meets national math, science and technology standards and is aligned to NASA’s mission directorates.  The NASA SEMAA project proactively addresses these goals by delivering a hands-on, minds-on curriculum, a state-of-the-art Aerospace Education Laboratory (AEL) and an innovative Family Café (see below).   K-12 STEM Curriculum • Aligned to the National Math, Science and Technology Standards • Encompasses the research and technology of each of NASA’s four Mission Directorates (Aeronautics Research, Exploration System, Science, Space Operations • Provides NASA SEMAA participants with 21 contact hours in STEM activities/sessions  Aerospace Education Laboratory (AEL) • Places cutting edge technology at the fingertips of NASA SEMAA middle and high school students • Engages students in real world challenges relative to both an aeronautics and microgravity scenario • Houses real aerospace hardware and software including an Advanced Flight Simulator (AFS); a laboratory-grade, research wind tunnel; and a working, short-wave radio receiver and hand-held GPS for aviation Family Café • Promotes sustained family involvement at each of the NASA SEMAA sites around the country • Provides parents/adult family members with relevant parenting and STEM education information • Researches and presents information to parents/adult family members on additional STEM related programs available for their child’s participation Due to the success of the NASA SEMAA project in Cleveland, beginning in 1998, the NASA SEMAA project was replicated across the United States.	In order to manage and coordinate the growing NASA SEMAA project, a National SEMAA Office (NSO) was established.	By the end of 1999, the project had been replicated in nine US cities; at the end of calendar year 2005, there were twenty-four sites across the US.	 The NASA SEMAA project is managed via a performance-based contract.  The Educational Programs Office at NASA Glenn manages the NASA SEMAA project, and the NSO administers the day-to-day operations.	Each NASA SEMAA Site has a sub-contract agreement with the NSO, and each site is contractually obligated to meet the requirements of the contract as well as adhere to NASA’s Education Operating Principles.  The role of the NSO is to assist NASA in the coordination of the NASA SEMAA project nationwide.	NASA furnishes the NSO with work statements for new tasks related to the operation, expansion and sustainability of the NASA SEMAA project.  Based on NASA funding, each NASA SEMAA site is contractually required to serve a predetermined number of students, offer both academic year and summer sessions, conduct end of session evaluations, submit quarterly reports, and garner adequate funding to enhance and sustain their operations beyond NASA funding.  In fiscal year 2006, seven NASA SEMAA sites were closed due to their inability to meet these and other contractual requirements.  In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2007, NASA will competitively select new NASA SEMAA sites in order to ensure that NASA educational opportunities are created in other communities.  In order to facilitate this growth, NASA anticipates that over the next five years that existing NASA SEMAA sites will be self-sustained or closed (if unable to become self-sustaining).  The NSO will work with NASA to implement this process. Other responsibilities of the NSO include but are not limited to: - Monitor the NASA SEMAA Sites (including operations of the AEL and the Family Café)  - Manage the GRC AEL (conduct student visits, teacher training, etc.) - Provide funding to the NASA SEMAA sites in a timely and  efficient manner - Work with NASA to develop and enhance curriculum for all aspects of the project - Conduct site visits and participate in site award/recognition ceremonies - Implement NASA SEMAA site replications (including AEL installation) - Market NASA SEMAA (including maintaining the NASA SEMAA website) - Establish National Committees to stay abreast of relevant trends, etc. - Conduct Special Projects to retain participants in the NASA STEM pipeline - Perform Data Collection, Evaluation and Reporting For additional information, visit the NASA SEMAA website at www.semaa.net No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 25 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Jean M. Rogers no later than July 7, 2006.

<DESC>Chem-Bio Sensor Feasibility Study for WMD Counterforce Applications Project/Global Strike Introduction: Success of current and future military operations is conditioned upon rapidly detecting threats, assessing them, and acting decisively to negate the threats in order to achieve operational objectives with minimal risk.  As part of the Battle Damage Assessm ent (BDA) for Global Strike Missions, Chemical Warfare, Biological Warfare and Toxic Industrial Chemical (from the ITF-25 list) sensors will be employed to help assess any releases from various strategic targets.  DTRA has tasked the Department of Energys  (DOE) Kansas City Plant to repackage existing sensors into a BLU-97 submunition form factor to meet remote deployment goals. Request: DTRA has tasked the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center to seek out Government Agencies and Commercial Vendors that can provide applicable sensors and collaboration for sensor repackaging.  ECBC has formed an Integrated Product Team to review candidates, a nd provide recommendations to DTRA. Package: The BLU-97 form factor is 6.65 inches long and 2.51 inches in diameter.  Vendors or Government Agencies must be willing to work with DTRA and the Department of Energy to repackage and integrate detectors into their sensor package and network.  Detector pac kages will transmit results to a command center in a yet to be determined manner.  Sensors will be expected to operate in the field for 2 to 4 days, without expectation for recovery.   Deployment: The BLU-97 type packages are expected to be dropped via aerial vehicle in groups of a yet undetermined quantity. Sensors: - Sensors should be of reasonable dimensions so that, with minimal reengineering and repackaging, they can meet the BLU-97 form factor.  This form factor will also contain an undisclosed power source as well as transmitting device.   - Sensors should be reasonably robust.  However, DOE will work with vendors to ruggedize repackaged devices. - Sensors should be able to digitally transmit data on demand or continually, so that it can be retrieved near real time. - Sensors should have a proven track record to function as advertised. Vendor Information: The Edgewood Chemical Biological Centers Battlefield Management Team has put together a Technology Screening Integrated Process Team to evaluate vendor proposals to fill these defined mission needs and specifications.  Vendors should contact Stephen Skoln ik at 410-436-3955 or Stephen.skolnik@us.army.mil, for direction on how to submit sensor details.  Database submissions and updates will be accepted from 7 July through 7 August, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- Intra-Connector Material Handling (ICMH)
<DESC>1.	Introduction – Intra-Connector Material Handling System (ICMH)
ATI requests a Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) proposal for Phase 1 of the subject project in support of the Office of Naval Research (ONR) for the Seabasing Future Naval Capability (FNC).  The ONR FNC has a need for an automated, self-tensioning cargo restraint technology to support cargo movement on U.S. Navy hovercraft.  The technology must be self-contained, capable of automatically tensioning, be self-adjusting under load restraining operations, be automatically released/de-tensioned and provide remote operation capability.  Other desired capabilities are a system operating condition status, commonly referred to as ‘health monitoring’ and selective load assignment to permit load de-tensioning for each selected cargo load, essentially an “item-by-item” unloading capability.  The complete RFP, including project specific evaluation criteria, is available at www.nsrp.org/seabasing/susd-icmh.html.  Submission of a response to this RFP is entirely voluntary and any and all costs of participation in this process will be the complete responsibility of the respondent.

2.	Funding and Period of Performance
The funding anticipated for Phase I of the project will be limited to a maximum of $300,000 for each awardee.  It is anticipated up to three Phase I proposals may be funded with a down-select to one following the completion of the initial six-month Phase I effort.  The anticipated period of performance for Phase I is six (6) months from contract award date, which is anticipated to be in October 2006.  The complete project (Phase I & II) inclusive of options is anticipated to be 36 months or less in length.  ATI reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this RFP.

3.	Proposal Submission Deadline

Balance capacities (Requirement 1): Total normal force capacity at zero pitch moment = 4000 lb;  Total pitch moment capacity at zero normal force = 6700 in-lb; Axial force capacity   = 3000 lb; Total side force capacity at zero yaw moment = 3000 lb (Requirement 2); Total yaw moment at zero side force = 4000 in-lb; Roll moment capacity = 1000 in-lb  (Requirement 3). B. Balance Dimensions/Geometry: Total Balance Length = 6.1 inches (Requirement 4); Metric Sleeve Length = 4.0 inches; Non-metric Rod Taper Length = 2.1 inches; Taper 0.625 in/ft; Taper diameter = ?  to fit taper gage 10191; Four balance pin holes 0.2812 dia. at 90-degree orientation at center of metric outer sleeve with a minimum clear depth of 0.10 inches without fouling on internal components at worst-case combined loading of all components. Non-metric taper shall provide for push-on screw contacts, push-off screw contacts, and positive roll retention compatible with Task taper variation 2. C. Requirements: 1. All non-gauged portions of the balance shall maintain a safety factor of 3.0 below ultimate strength at worst-case combined loading to capacity in all components.All gauged portions of the balance shall maintain a safety factor of 2.0 below ultimate strength at worst-case combined loading to capacity in all components. 2.  Side Force capacity is somewhat optional. Lower capacity provides capability for using balance rolled 90 degrees and obtaining higher measurement resolution, but this is not a requirement – design is acceptable with side force capacity equal to normal force capacity and yaw moment capacity equal to 80% of pitch moment capacity. 3. Roll moment capacity is optional/negotiable if it constrains other aspects of the balance design. 4.  Total length may be increased up to 6.6 inches by extending the non-metric inner rod forward of the metric outer sleeve, provided that portion extending forward of the outer sleeve does not exceed 0.5 inch of length and has a diameter less than 1.25 inches.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for the manufacture of low-melt viscosity polyimide resins: 55 lbs of a NASA Glenn proprietary low-melt viscosity polyimide resin with an absolute viscosity in the range of 10-15 poise as measured by the Brookfield viscometer at 280 °C within 1 hour period.	The resin is composed of asymmetrical 2,3,3’,4’-biphenyldianhydride [CAS#36978-41-3], 3,4’-oxydianiline and 4-phenylethynylphthalic anhydride.  The process requires mixing all the three monomers into a homogeneous powder, and heating the monomer mixture to 450 °F and maintained the mixture with vigorous stirring at 450 °F for at least 1 hour until it melted into a viscous solution and fully imidized.  The vendor need to make sure it is totally imidized as indicated by Infrared Spectroscopy, before cooling it down and pouring the resin out of the reaction vessel.  Then the imidized resin has to be grounded into powders. 1)  To qualify for this manufacturing project, the vendor needs to prove its capability to produce or acquire high purity of  asymmetrical 2,3,3’,4’-biphenyldianhydride (&gt;98%pure) and electronic grade 4-phenylethynylphthalic anhydride (99% pure), besides the commercially available 3,4’-oxydianiline.  2)  The vendor also needs to ensure that the absolute viscosity of the resin meets the requirement of 10-15 poise at 280 °C over 1 hour period, as measured by theBrookfield Viscometer.  Moreover, the vendor needs to prevent lots to lots variation of resin to maintain a low-melt viscosity not exceeding 15 poise. 3)  The vendor is required to deliver the first installment of	30 lbs of the ground imide resin powder by August 30, 2006,	and the remaining 25 lbs of resin by the end of September 30, 2006.

<DESC>This proposal is for the addition of NSNs to the existing Corporate Contract with MAS Industries, LLC., formerly M and A Supply, Inc., SP0760-05-D-9744.   The contract is a long-term contract, currently in its 1 Option Year with 8 full Option Years remaining. These NSNs are intended to be added under the same terms and conditions as the original solicitation; therefore, an RFP will be issued only if Offerors other than the aforementioned source is interested in this procurement.  The scope of this initiative is items for which MAS Industries, LLC, has supplied in the past directly or through dealers, whether or not the NSNs are ultimately procured from MAS Industries, LLC.  Items will be procured on an All or None basis per NSN.  Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not posses complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors described in the original solicitation.  See Note(s): 9. Submitted correspondence must include the name, organization, address, e-mail address, telephone number and facsimile number of a designated point of contact.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number is S-AQMPD-06-Q-1053.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 05-09. The order type is firm fixed price.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430.  The solicitation pricing on .www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on Wednesday, June 28, 2006 at 10:00  a.m. Eastern time (in effect at the time quotes are due) or as otherwise displayed at .www.FedBid.com.  FOB destination is Washington, D.C.. The Department?s Bureau of Information Resource Management requires renewal of software maintenance support (Updated Subscription Services and Support) for existing licenses and purchase of new licenses with maintenance support as listed in (1) above. These licenses and maintenance are required to maintain the existing Groove infrastructure domestically and abroad, as well as expand the infrastructure as described for the SMART project.  Groove is a working environment that promotes the notion of a shared desktop.  Project files, documents, schedules, calendars and many other items can be seamlessly shared across IT boundaries.  This facilitates working groups that have to work under tight timelines. The Dos Information Technology Change Control Board (ITCCB) change management-approved addition of the Groove products to the DoS baseline.  DoS has invested significantly in training and deployment of Groove software in order to support Iraq embassy operations, the Secretary?s? travel teams, Arms Control operations, S/ES, OBO, and several other important missions where there is a need to share documents and project files collaboratively over geographically dispersed facilities. Groove is the first successful collaborative software tool deployed at the Department of State.  DoS inherited the original infrastructure during the Iraq handoff.  Groove was used to setup IT operations over a network that had intermittent bandwidth in an austere environment.  Groove allows collaboration over poor or even ?no? bandwidth environments as it replicates contents to each peer PC.  Other collaborative products evaluated by DoS do not employ government certified encryption methods. It?s in the government?s interest to choose COTS products that are compatible and widely accepted by industry and other government partners.   Microsoft recently acquired Groove networks.  The state of collaborative software is such that collaborative tools interoperate with each other, but not necessarily with tools provided by other vendors.  Because Microsoft acquired Groove and it is a part of Microsoft Office, Groove as a collaborative environment will continue to be one of the primary collaboration environments available.  Because Groove is becoming so well accepted, we can instantly collaborate with many other government agencies. The ability to share information between Government Agencies has been mandated by Congress.  Groove is one of the few examples of a COTS product that can cross Government Agency IT boundaries. Under the SMART plan, Groove collaborative software will be introduced to posts that have the need to share workspaces with offices in the Department of State and potentially with other offices in other US Government agencies. Groove has undergone FIPS, NIST, NIAP and internal IA and CCB evaluation and/or accreditation.   Groove has undergone rigorous DoS testing, certification and accreditation, user acceptance and ITCCB approval.  There has been significant investment in training of Arms Control and SMART personnel on the maintenance of the Groove infrastructure. We have several contractors trained in server maintenance, forms building and collaborative space deployment.  There is not another COTS product that can fulfill the value of this product at this time, additionally evaluation and deployment of an additional infrastructure would require a significant investment of time and funds in addition to the license and maintenance costs.  Therefore, these requirements preclude consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) to be used in the Process Measurements Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***
 
BACKGROUND:
The Process Sensing Group at NIST has a requirement for a scanning probe microscope system (SPM) also referred to as an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).  The SPM will be a shared user instrument, used by several projects within the PSG including chemical microsensors, nanomaterial sensors (gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and nanowires), and biological thin films of DNA and proteins.  Successful analysis of these diverse materials requires a SPM instrument with high resolution, dynamic scan area, multiple imaging modes, the ability to analyze large samples, and compatibility with standard accessories for future expansion of experimental capabilities.  Because metrology is of critical importance to the projects studied at NIST, it is required that the SPM system be equipped with independent x-y and z scanners, to eliminate cross talk and image bowing typical of stacked x-y-z piezoelectric tube scanners, and closed-loop hardware feedback to obtain exact and repeatable placement of tip to substrate.  

The Contractor shall provide a quote for the following line item:

Line Item 0001:  Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM)

The required microscope shall meet or exceed the following specifications:
 
1) Computer controlled system including a PC computer and system controller electronics interface allowing for control of sample stage, tip placement, and computer control of instrument for acquisition of scanning images and stationary tip surface measurements.  System control unit to computer communication interface to be USB based enabling future computer system upgrades by PSG.  Future software upgrades shall be included in the purchase price.

2) The system shall include "offline" software for data analysis and processing that can be installed on computers supplied by PSG.  The software will have the ability to export data (both force distance curves and images) in Image File (JPG, PNG, BMP) and Text File (TXT) formats.  Future software upgrades shall be included.

3)  The system shall include a motorized Z stage to move the sample in the z direction relative to the tip and an X-Y sample stage to move the sample in the x and y directions relative to the tip.

<DESC>Amendment 1 is issued to change the required quantity from one to two each.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price type contract.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the IN-SNEC, for a Cortex Command, Ranging and Telemetry Unit CRT XL-2, Model F261630, as it is believed that this is the only source with that can provide 100% functional compatibility and performance with the existing Cortex CRTs.  This acquisition will be processed under simplified acquisition procedures (Part 13). 

Brand Name Justification:  IN-SNEC Cortex units are THE OPERATIONAL GOES I-Q Telemetry & Command Front End Processors. The telemetry and command transmission system called the Replacement Telemetry Acquisition & Command Transmission System (RTACTS). As an integral part of this system, the Cortex unit functions as the front end processor. The Cortex is a digital signal processing (DSP) unit which can simultaneously demodulate L & S band telemetry and modulate the command data received from the RTACTS Sun E-250. It responsibilities in the GOES ground system are as follows: simultaneously demodulate the L & S telemetry received from the GOES spacecraft and format it into a usable minor frame, produce a modulated 16 KHz subcarrier which in turn is modulated onto a 74.2 MHz carrier, and incorporate the ability to range the GOES spacecraft. The design of the Cortex DSP algorithms are proprietary in nature and have been extensively tested by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ground system engineers to determine compatibility with the GOES grounds system and spacecraft. Within the RTACTS, extensive code has been developed to interact with the Cortex’s Application interface which produces full monitoring and control capability. The RTACTS system and its Cortex front end processor are currently the telemetry, command and control interface to this nation’s weather satellites. IN-SNEC’s Cortex units are currently the only front end processors that can fulfill the GOES ground system requirements without a costly redesign to the RTACTS system and possible disruption to the GOES satellites.  These units have been through extensive testing within their subsystem, RTACTS & NTACTS respectively, and are operational 24/7. The operational software in the RTACTS & NTACTS was specifically designed to communicate with IN-SNEC's interface control document (ICD) and therefore units other than those procured from from IN-SNEC are almost 100% likely not to function properly.   

1.0  SPECIFICATIONS:  Furnish and deliver one (1) Cortex Command, Ranging and Telemetry Unit CRT XL-2, Model F261630.  This model has:  No. of IF inputs:  2; Max. no. of receiver: 3; Max. no. of IF Modulator:  2; and Support of Synchronized Commanding:  Yes.  The CORTEX XL-2 supports all functions required for AMOS 3 satellites operation.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with 13.5, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number is S-AQMPD-06-Q-1053.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 05-09. The order type is firm fixed price.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430.  The solicitation pricing on .www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on Wednesday, June 28, 2006 at 10:00  a.m. Eastern time (in effect at the time quotes are due) or as otherwise displayed at .www.FedBid.com.  FOB destination is Washington, D.C.. The Department's Bureau of Information Resource Management requires renewal of software maintenance support (Updated Subscription Services and Support) for existing licenses and purchase of new licenses with maintenance support as listed in (1) above. These licenses and maintenance are required to maintain the existing Groove infrastructure domestically and abroad, as well as expand the infrastructure as described for the SMART project.  Groove is a working environment that promotes the notion of a shared desktop.  Project files, documents, schedules, calendars and many other items can be seamlessly shared across IT boundaries.  This facilitates working groups that have to work under tight timelines. The Dos Information Technology Change Control Board (ITCCB) change management-approved addition of the Groove products to the DoS baseline.  DoS has invested significantly in training and deployment of Groove software in order to support Iraq embassy operations, the Secretary?s? travel teams, Arms Control operations, S/ES, OBO, and several other important missions where there is a need to share documents and project files collaboratively over geographically dispersed facilities. Groove is the first successful collaborative software tool deployed at the Department of State.  DoS inherited the original infrastructure during the Iraq handoff.  Groove was used to setup IT operations over a network that had intermittent bandwidth in an austere environment.  Groove allows collaboration over poor or even ?no? bandwidth environments as it replicates contents to each peer PC.  Other collaborative products evaluated by DoS do not employ government certified encryption methods. It?s in the government's interest to choose COTS products that are compatible and widely accepted by industry and other government partners.   Microsoft recently acquired Groove networks.  The state of collaborative software is such that collaborative tools interoperate with each other, but not necessarily with tools provided by other vendors.  Because Microsoft acquired Groove and it is a part of Microsoft Office, Groove as a collaborative environment will continue to be one of the primary collaboration environments available.  Because Groove is becoming so well accepted, we can instantly collaborate with many other government agencies. The ability to share information between Government Agencies has been mandated by Congress.  Groove is one of the few examples of a COTS product that can cross Government Agency IT boundaries. Under the SMART plan, Groove collaborative software will be introduced to posts that have the need to share workspaces with offices in the Department of State and potentially with other offices in other US Government agencies. Groove has undergone FIPS, NIST, NIAP and internal IA and CCB evaluation and/or accreditation.   Groove has undergone rigorous DoS testing, certification and accreditation, user acceptance and ITCCB approval.  There has been significant investment in training of Arms Control and SMART personnel on the maintenance of the Groove infrastructure. We have several contractors trained in server maintenance, forms building and collaborative space deployment.  There is not another COTS product that can fulfill the value of this product at this time, additionally evaluation and deployment of an additional infrastructure would require a significant investment of time and funds in addition to the license and maintenance costs.  Therefore, these requirements preclude consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Clarified that the prices shall include restricted rights use for 5 user licenses for each of the licenses listed in the price table and Enterprise Assurance for three and a half years beginning with the award date of the contract.

<DESC>Questions/Answers

Request for Proposal No. SN06R0009
Questions/Answers
June 27, 2006



•	Are electronic bid submittals acceptable?  NO - PLEASE SUBMIT A HARDCOPY 
 
•	Is there a range of historical Task Order value or typical scope of work?  SIMILAR TO THE STATEMENT OF WORK IN THE RFP 
 
•	What is the percentage of sonic vs. auger/direct push, ATV drilling methods?  90% ROTOSONIC
  
•	Is there any training in excess of OSHA standard 1910.120 relative to potential radioactive exposure?  10CFR 835 RAD WORKER II WITH AN NTS (SITE-SPECIFIC) MODULE IS ADEQUATE. 
 
•	Does a certified welder need to be onsite or available at the contractor facility?  NO 
 
•	Is the reference to OSHA 1910.126 a typographical error and if not, how does it apply to this scope of work?  IT SHOULD READ 1910.120  

•	What permits are required?  NO PERMITS ARE REQUIRED 
 
•	If so, is the contractor responsible for all permit fees?  NOT APPLICABLE 

•	What are the referenced NRC licenses or certifications required?  NO NRC REQUIREMENTS - THIS WAS LISTED IN ERROR 
 
•	What are the primary potential contaminants of concern?  PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS (DIESEL OR GASOLINE) AND CONSTITUENTS. 
 
•	The SOW implies in the text that the Drilling Supervisor/Driller is one person.  Section B – Pricing Schedule/Proposal Form lists a separate Drilling Supervisor, Driller, Helpers (2).  Should one rate be supplied for the Drilling Supervisor/Driller as part of a 3-man crew or is it intended to have a 4-man crew?  3-MAN CREW - LIST EACH JOB CLASSIFICATION WITH SPECIFIC RATE 
 
•	Are 6 samplers required?  YES AS PER THE SOW  





•	 Is the 10CFR 835 Rad Worker II training provided at the NTS site or is this the responsibility of the subcontractor to independently obtain?  What is the length of the required or site specific training?   RAD WORKER II TRAINING IS PROVIDED AT  NTS.  SNJV WILL HELP WITH ENROLLMEN IN REQUIRED CLASSES.  THE SUBCONTRACTOR WILL NEED TO INDPENDENTLY OBTAIN/MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL DOCUMENTATION.  SOME JOBS DO NOT REQEUIRE RAD WORKER II CERTIFICATION.  THIS IS A JOB-DEPENDENT REQUIREMENT AND WILL BE LISTED IN SITE SPECIFIC SOWS.  THE REQUIRED TRAINING, INCLUDING SITE SPECIFIC, IS 2-DAYS IN DURATION. 

•	It appears from the accelerated bid process and the short duration of the initial phase of the contract encompassing August and September that there may be priority projects during that time frame or projects that cannot be performed by others.  What would be the expected task order size and type of drilling required during this 2-month period?  Would the Rad Worker II training be required for task orders performed during this time?  ROTOSONIC DRILLING AND THIS WILL REQUIRE RAD WORKER II.  DUE TO THE SHORT NOTICE, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT SNJV WILL HAVE TO MAKE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO HOLD THE TRAINING FOR THE CREW. – JOB WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 80 TO 100 HOURS.





Stoller-Navarro Joint Venture (SNJV), as the prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO), will conduct environmental investigations at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), Mercury, Nevada.
