<DESC>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on behalf of the Precision Engineering Division, with FEI Company of Hillsboro, OR, for a service contract for a scanning electron microscope.  

The Precision Engineering Division, Nanoscale Metrology Group, utilizes an FEI Helios NanoLab Dual-beam Scanning Electron Microscope.   The microscope is equipped with a SideWinder FEG type ion optical column, an Elstar electron optical column, a high-accuracy laser interferometer sample stage, a cryo-sample stage, an energy dispersive micro-analyzer, and other essential detectors and measurement systems.  

The microscope has shown excellent imaging resolution and is very capable of providing needed information and carrying out measurements and calibrations on various samples of the above-mentioned group. In order to ensure the performance of the FEI Helios, a 
maintenance contract must be maintained. 

FEI Company is the sole source for the maintenance contract.  All equipment being covered under the service agreement are commercial items.  FEI has proprietary rights to the technology which governs the hardware and software.  FEI Company guarantees the full system performance of the instrument.  A potential source would have to possess proprietary knowledge of the FEI equipment.  No other vendor possesses the knowledge to provide the required service and maintenance.  No other vendor has rights to FEI’s proprietary hardware and software. FEI has no distributors.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by August 9, 2010, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Westboro Photonics, of Ontario, Canada (exclusive North American distributors for Instrument Systems), for the acquisition of an Instrument Systems UV-VIS-NIR CCD Detector to supplement the Instrument Systems spectroradiometer currently being used in the Optical Technology division of NIST’s Physics Laboratory.  

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

NIST currently utilizes an Instrument Systems spectroradiometer in the Optical Division of the Physics Laboratory.  A research need exists that requires that the current spectroradiometer be expanded into a CCD-array spectroradiometer system by the addition of a CCD detector to the existing instrument. 

The Instrument Systems CCD Detector is the only CCD detector that offers 100% compatibility and part-interchangeability with the existing Instrument Systems spectroradiometer.  In addition, significant characterization and evaluation testing has been performed with the existing spectroradiometer instrument, as well as customized LabView programs.  These programs can be used for an Instrument Systems CCD detector without modification or replacement. 

Westboro Photonics is the only contractor who can provide the Instrument Systems UV-VIS-NIR CCD Detector that meets NIST’s requirements.  Therefore, Westboro Photonics is uniquely qualified to provide the required Instrument Systems UV-VIS-NIR CCD Detector.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on August 7, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc. (PPD), Vaccines and Biologics Laboratory, 466 Devon Park Drive, Wayne, PA 19087-1816, for testing services using the human papillomavirus (HPV) 4-Serotype Competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA) to evaluate the antibody response pre-and post-vaccine licensure to HPV types 16, 18, 6 and 11 in samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the HPV Sentinel Surveillance Study.
<p>HPV is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection and because of its etiologic role in cervical cancer, is a significant public health issue. HPV is not a single virus, but is a family of more than 100 closely related viruses. High-risk types such as HPV-16 and-18 are associated with cervical cancer where as low-risk HPVs such as HPV-6 and -11 are associated with the production of benign genital warts. In clinical trials vaccines against HPV have been shown to be effective in preventing infection and genital cancer precursors associated with the targeted types. HPV vaccination is now recommended in the US, and monitoring the impact of this vaccine is a key priority. HPV serology is an important tool to determine the baseline exposure of the US population to the vaccine types.</p>
<p>The CDC requires a high-throughput assay to measure the type-specific antibody response to the four HPV types targeted by current vaccine formulations; HPV 16 and 18 (Gardasil and Cervarix) and 6 and 11 (Garadasil). Due to limitations in sample volume, the assay must be in a multi-plex format. Additional requirements are that the results be quantitative and measure neutralizing epitopes on L1 viral like particles (VLPs). The competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA), a high-throughput multiplex assay that allows for quantitative measurement of 4 HPV type-specific antibodies against neutralizing epitopes meets this requirement. At this time the CDC laboratory does not have an assay of this capability and therefore the services of a CRO capable of performing cLIA in a time efficient and standardized manner would be greatly beneficial in testing the serum samples collected for various epidemiological studies pre and post vaccine licensure. The reliability of this assay is recognized as it was used in clinical trials determining the safety and efficacy of one of the current licensed HPV vaccines, Gardasil.</p>
<p>This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541990. No solicitation is being issued. Note 22 applies herein. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions no calls will be addressed, please e-mail gmorgan1@cdc.gov to contact Gary Morgan.</p>

<DESC>This is a notification of the National Park Service (NPS) intent to issue a Sole Source award to GeoSpatial Experts for software license maintenance and upgrade of existing NPS developed software called GPS-PhotoLink NPS Edition.  This contract will have a base period with four option periods. This is not a request for quote nor shall there any written solicitation to follow.

Upgrade to existing, installed GPS-PhotoLink software.  GPS-Photo Link is software that maps your photos. The PC-based software works with virtually any digital camera coupled with a GPS. Use GPS-Photo Link to accurately map photographs for display on a digital map layer such as Google Earth or in a geographic information system (GIS) such as ArcGIS. Create customizable watermarked photos, word reports or html reports. Perform advanced analysis in ArcGIS. Share the geotagged photos, data, and maps between organizations. 

In Fiscal Year 2006 NPS contracted with GeoSpatial Experts to develop an NPS specific software that best supports the NPS mission.  This software is only available through GeoSpatial Experts and is proprietary to the company.  This software developer is the only company authorized to support and maintains the NPS specific PhotoLink software which is currently installed within the existing IT environment.  Purchases of new software licenses must be the NPS specific version of the software in order to maintain software maintenance agreements on current licensing.  
Experts is the developer and owner of the proprietary rights to PhotoLink NPS Edition and only company that can supply needed maintenance on the existing installed NPS developed software.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a sole source award to PaperThin, Inc. for consulting and support services for their Commonspot Content Management System. To enable a closer relationship, PaperThin and NPS will enter into a more engaged Support Services relationship.
The goals for this engagement are to: Ensure that PaperThin's extensive experience and best practices are made available to NPS/DOI. Provide strategic technical consultation on architectural issues related to the inner workings/architecture of CommonSpot. Ensure that NPS/DOI utilize CommonSpot's framework to its fullest capabilities and deploy websites and applications rapidly and efficiently in a supported manner. Create a communication pipeline that allows issues/questions to be identified and resolved faster and ultimately to create a process of growth that steers the NPS/DOI CommonSpot implementation away from future issues.
The NPS currently uses PaperThin's CommonSpot software and recently began expanding use of the software for full integration of all hosted websites within the NPS framework (both public and private).  NPS requires PaperThin's unique knowledge to ensure that the NPS configuration and system architecture meet with the best practices of the product and all development work is completed in an optimal way that will meet scalability and system requirements.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes there shall be no written solicitation to follow.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.
       
This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-44.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

BACKGROUND
The National Institute of Standards and Technology/Center for Neutron Research (NIST/NCNR), has developed a national facility for neutron scattering.  The facility provides over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research.  Instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.  

The NCNR is continuously developing new and better instruments for neutron scattering.  This requirement is for a mean neutron velocity selector with narrow distribution from the broad ‘white’ distribution produced by the moderation done by a hydrogen cold source of the initially room temperature water moderated nuclear reactor’s spectrum.  The neutron velocity selector (NVS) must be able to select the correct velocity range with high efficiency of transport.  

The required selector will be located after a neutron guide that transports the neutrons away from the reactor and the cold source.  Based upon the geometry of the instrument, the velocity selector must not deflect the beam direction.  For non-deflection of the beam, the velocity selection must be completed using high-speed rotation of a device that has helical channels made from neutron absorbing material, known as a helical neutron velocity selector.

All quoters shall provide a quotation for all of the following line items.

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Neutron Velocity Selector.  The neutron velocity selector must meet all of the required specifications identified herein.  All equipment must be new.  Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.

1) The neutron velocity selector shall be supplied as a complete, turnkey system including the neutron velocity selector, control electronics, sensors, cables, computer and software. NIST shall supply vacuum pumps, as well as electrical and chilled water services.

2) Wavelength range: 0.46 nm to 1.0 nm. The neutron velocity selector must operate uninterrupted at any wavelength within this range for a minimum of one week; 

3) Acceptable bandwidth (full-width at half-maximum &#61508;&#61548;/&#61548;): 12.5% to 14%;

4) Beam transmission at peak: 90 % at a minimum.  Stronger consideration will be given to quoters whose equipment offers a beam transmission of 93% or greater;

6) Neutron absorption material on blades:  Boron 10 or Lithium 6;

7) For purposes of calculating bandwidth and beam transmission, the following beam 
divergence is required: +/- 0.0005 radians;
		
8) The non-rotating transmission of 0.4 nm wavelength neutrons must be < 0.001. Transmission is defined specifically for 0.4 nm wavelength neutrons, and is defined as the (number of 0.4 nm neutrons exiting)/(the number of 0.4 nm neutrons incident).  Non-rotating transmission is measured when the velocity selector is not rotating, with a neutron beam incident on the neutron window;
				
9) Length of selector from outside of neutron window-to-window shall not exceed 500 mm. Stronger consideration will be given to quoters whose equipment offers a length
less than 420mm;

10) Width of selector shall not exceed 500 mm. Stronger consideration will be given to quoters whose equipment offers a width less than 420 mm;
		
11) Total length of velocity selector, including motor, electrical connectors, etc. shall not exceed 800mm. Stronger consideration will be given to quoters whose equipment offers a total length less than 500 mm;

12)  The software provided shall be part of the complete turnkey system.  The software must be able to control the neutron velocity selector throughout its rotational speed operating range, and monitor and control based on system diagnostics.

NIST requires the ability to control the NVS software from NIST’s data acquisition software. The NIST data acquisition software will communicate via a serial RS-232 connection.
