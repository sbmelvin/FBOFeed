<DESC>NASA/Godddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for the improvement of an inexpensive and reliable method of producing electrostatically clean solar panels for the Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) and Global Electrodynamics (GED) Solar Arrays.   The requirements include the production of a minimum of one qualification panel and a prototype panel.   Under a previous NASA contract, a composite graphite fiber aperture was developed that fit over the spaces between the cells. The aperture, which was insulated on the backside, kept the spaces between the cells at spacecraft potential and did not allow the space plasma to see array potential. This acquisition focuses on apects of the work that were not completely solved. The electrical connection between the indium tin oxide coated covers and the aperture was not as reliable as required after thermal cycling and the covers had an anti-reflection (AR) coating that interfered with good electrical connection to the covers. Another aspect remained untried, namely the repair of a broken cover or cracked solar cell. Also, further optimization is desired in terms of the power loss caused by the aperture and the weight increase caused by the aperture. It may also be possible to increase the number of cells under a single cover, which were two under the previous effort.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be firm-fixed price and is limited to a budget of $300,000. The acquisition will be conducted using NASA MidRange procedures found in NASA FAR Supplement Part 1871. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 (See Note 26).  This procurement is a total small business set-aside (See Note 1).  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.  The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified  responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about 15 June 2001 with an anticipated offer due date approximately 30 days later after the RFO is released. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility owned by the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC) and located in Fairmont, WV.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC). The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source. The IV&V facility was constructed by WVURC under a NASA grant, and title of the completed facility was transferred to WVURC.  The grant also stipulated that NASA would occupy the facility to perform IV&V services for the Agency. In support of this activity, NASA has funded WVURC for the operation and maintenance of the facility in support of the NASA activities conducted at the facility since the original occupation in October 1993. Therefore, this action will result in a follow-on contract to the current cooperative agreement with WVURC. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of specialized services, such services may be deemed to be available from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition. Based on this, competition of the effort is not reasonable because of the substantial investment in the physical facility and the fact that WVURC has title to the facility and is the owner/operator.  Therefore, WVURC is determined to be the only responsible source capable of providing the O&M and other physical infrastructure necessary to support NASA operations. The anticipated period of performance of the resultant contract is 10 years. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 13, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA has received several industry responses to its notification on October 25, 2002 regarding the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems consolidation stating that NASA intends full and open competition; therefore, we would like to solicit additional ideas.  The contemplated EVA consolidation would combine work from four current contracts; the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) EVA contract (NAS 9-97150), the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) portion of the NBL/Spacecraft Vehicle Mockup Facility contract, the Space Flight Operations Contract - Flight Crew Equipment (SFOC-FCE) (NAS 9-20000), and the Science Engineering Analysis and Test contract (SEAT) (NAS 9-19100).	For many years, we have awarded hardware and sustaining efforts associated with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) related EMU activity non-competitively to Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International.	Qualification of a proven second source for OEM related activities would be extensive.	NASA does not desire to direct a subcontract.  Given this situation, please provide your options for contract strategy.   Please provide your response to Jessica Niebuhr by January 15, 2003.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for future postings.

<DESC>This RFI is revised to update the phone number for the point of contact.

Note: This is a Request for Information only.  Do not respond with quotes, proposals or offers. This RFI does not represent a commitment by the CPA to issue an RFP or RFQ.  Submissions should not be in .ZIP format.   Responses my be sent directly to the POC as listed in paragraph 7.0  

1.0	SUBJECT. Request for Information (RFI) for a Personnel Management/Pay and Accounting System for the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on May 7, 2004.  See section 7.0 for further information.


2.0	PROBLEM DESCRIPTION.  The Department of Defense (DoD), Office of Security Cooperation, is tasked to organize, train, mentor, and equip credible and capable Iraqi Security Forces in order to accelerate the transition of security from Coalition Forces to Iraqi Forces.  In order to effectively accomplish this goal, a responsive personnel management, pay and accounting system must be in place.  The current methods in place are entirely manual.  The method of payment relies upon rosters being centrally maintained along with centralized disbursement of pay across Iraq.  At the current growth rate there will be nearly 6000 being paid by mid May of 2004 and over 30,000 being paid by September 2004. This system will quickly become too labor intensive to effectively manage.

3.0	OBJECTVE. To procure an automated personnel management system that incorporates a pay and accounting system. Instructions and display characters shall be in both Arabic and English.  Initial training may need to be included with the system.  The scope of the technical solution may be from a combination of automated/manual system up to and including an integrated, Web based, commercial software package that is responsive, and cost-effective.  The Government will consider separate solutions/installation schedules.

4.0	HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


This section enumerates the high-level functionality and requirements for a Personnel Management/Pay and Accounting System.  

The high end solution will enable customers to input individual personnel data at recruit initial entry points and will allow updates via trusted clients at personnel support centers located at permanent duty stations. The Personnel Management portion of the system should be able to be implemented separately from the Pay and Accounting System but will utilize data fields common to both systems.  The Bandwidth conservative solutions are preferred over bandwidth insensitive solutions. A dial up, text only interface should be included as an option or even the solution.
The Government desires the best commercially-available system that fulfills the objectives described in this Statement of Objectives (SOO).  A turnkey solution is desired.  While negotiable, the source code shall be treated as Government-Off-The Shelf (GOTS), to include unlimited Government data rights. Expedience is a priority over technical depth.
Planned Fielding and System Characteristics.  The Government plans an initial deployment to the Ministry of Defense located in Baghdad and will grow to incorporate 10 military bases and several recruiting centers.  The system must incorporate a data base that must be able to support a work force of 300,000 personnel.  The following characteristics are desirable:
„X	Must be compatible with Windows OS.
„X	Support a broadly distributed network.
„X	Incorporate appropriate measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation. Where technical solutions allow, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication is desired.  
„X	Be able to support concurrent actions from multiple nodes.
„X	Provide a process for auditing, track authors, permissions, history and generate session logs.
„X	Incorporate printable reports for individual personnel.
„X	All user, audit and other collaboration-related files and data will be stored on Government-provided storage devices.  
„X	Support node additions by Government representatives without the requirement for contractor system support personnel. 
The contractor is to install and operate all associated software at the primary Personnel Support Center.  System training may be conducted on site.  Instruction and training for follow on installations at remote sites must be provided.

5.0	RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. We would like the following sections to be covered:

Section 1 ¡V Software modules and implementation alternatives

Briefly describe your proposed software functionality. Include information on each module¡¦s capabilities, and propose implementation alternatives.

Section 2 ¡V System implementation methodology

Briefly describe your implementation approach and provide examples of similar projects where your company has implemented this software including but not limited to the region of the Middle East.

Section 3 ¡V Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide software costs (licenses fees and structure). Provide user training costs and discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations

Section 4 ¡V Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI. Any relevant lessons learned.  


Section 5 ¡V Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.


6.0	DISCLAIMER

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Contract.  This effort was previously announced in the International Space Station (ISS) Integration and Control Contract Strategy Request for Information synopsis 9-BG-12-2-69P, in March 2002.  The contract strategy package was updated and forwarded to industry through the internet in June 2002.  The URL for the location of the ISS Integration and Control Contract Strategy package is	     http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/=09=20=20= =20   .   The EVA Systems procurement has recently been disengaged from the ISS Integration and Control Strategy.   The effort for the consolidated Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) Systems contract is contemplated to encompass, in phased increments over the life of the contract, the development, sustaining engineering, and processing of EVA Hardware plus the integration of EVA requirements.  This contract will support the EVA requirements for the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) and the International Space Station Program (ISS), including activities within those programs involving payloads and international partners. This contract will also support EVA hardware research and development that is consistent with NASA's vision and mission statement.  In addition, this contract is contemplated to encompass the management of Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) activities supporting EVA training and development.  The NBL scope of work will be included as an option under this contract, which will provide a contracting mechanism for exercise at an appropriate time during the contract period of performance, which will be no earlier than 2 years after award of the NBL Operations contract (currently being competed) or no later than 5 years after the award.   This contemplated effort is planned to represent a consolidation of the EVA portions of the following contracts:  the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) EVA contract (NAS 9-97150), the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) portion of the NBL/Spacecraft Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF) contract, the Space Flight Operations Contract - Flight Crew Equipment (SFOC-FCE) (NAS 9-20000), and the Science Engineering Analysis and Test contract (SEAT) (NAS 9-19100).	 For the purposes of this contemplated effort, the term "EVA Hardware" includes all items, software, or devices that can be used to support EVA flight and training events.   The term EVA hardware includes all Class I (flight), Class II (qualification), Class III (training) and NBL training hardware.	Examples include:  the Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the EVA tools, the Secondary Breathing Gas System (SBGS), the Pistol Grip Tool (PGT), the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), the EMU/EVA bags, the ISS EMU Umbilical (IEU), the	ISS Battery Charger Assembly (BCA), the ISS Battery Stowage Assembly (BSA),the EMU Middeck Battery Charger, the Operational Bioinstrumentation System (OBS), the Communications Carrier Assembly (CCA) and Metal-Oxide (METOX) Regenerator and Canisters.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.   NASA is seeking capabilities from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.   Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).	Technical and procurement questions should be directed to Jessica M. Niebuhr.  Comments may be forwarded to Jessica M. Niebuhr via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission. This Request for Information/Sources Sought Synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.= =20 Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to the identified point of contact. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. All responses shall be submitted to Jessica M. Niebuhr either in writing or via email no later than 3:00 p.m. CDT, October 4, 2002.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a formal solicitation or a request for proposals.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Program Management Office, Coalition Provisional Authority is seeking to determine if companies are interested in operating the 17 remote sites on a fee-for-services basis.  Potential contract is likely to start as a cost plus, with the options to convert to a fee-for-services reimbursement basis after the first year.  Strong emphasis on Iraqi company participation is a goal(Prime-Mentor relationship).   Security would remain a cost plus line item through the period of performance.   The CPA is interested in obtaining industry feedback on the feasibility, a rough order of mangnitude of probable costs and alternatives to meeting this requirement. Submit e-mail responses to Mr. Tom Courtney at Courtneyte@orha.centcom.mil or Ms. Barbara Heald at healdb@orha.centcom.mil.
