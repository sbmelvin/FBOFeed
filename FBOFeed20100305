<DESC>U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division has a requirement to acquire Containerized Expeditionary TRICON Systems. The Government anticipates that this will result in a Five Year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts.  The Government anticipates that this acquisition will result in two (2) five year IDIQ type contracts per each ETS system.  The minimum requirement will be divided among the most qualified offerors.  The submission of individual proposals is required for each system proposed.  Offerors may bid on one or all of the systems. There is a potential for joint services requirements in addition to the US Armys Force Provider requirement.  The Army Acquisition Objective is currently 56 Modules.  52 modules have been built to date.  The ETS concept consists of the following:  an Expeditionary TRICON Latrine System (ELS), Expeditionary TRICON Shower System (ESS), Expeditionary TRICON Kitchen System (EKS), and Expeditionary TRICON Batch Laundry System (EBL); all of which are part of a continuing effort to provide improved combat field service equipment for the expeditionary War Fighter.  The Product Manger, Force Sustainment Systems Combat Field Service Equipment Team (PM FSS CFSET) developed the concept of the TRICON-based support systems.  This concept is based on the existing ISO (20-foot) containerized support systems currently in use by the joint services and managed by PM FSS.  The new design, based on the expandable ISO TRICON (8 x 6.5 x 8) platform will provide more flexibility and capability for the expeditionary War Fighter in a smaller and more easily deployed unit, fully transportable by sea, air, or land.  Prototype and limited production ETS assets have been designed, fabricated and successfully field-tested and deployed, and are available to view at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center.  The systems sought via this contract effort shall be built-to-print based on existing technical data packages.  All systems shall incorporate an integral water supply and waste water storage and be capable of discharging waste water up to 50-feet away at sufficient capacities to keep up with maximum discharge of each system; incorporate an onboard pump system of sufficient capacity for delivery of hot and cold water for all related operations and be environmentally controlled.  Power for these systems shall be supplied from a military standard generator (60 kW, 208 Volt, 3 Phase 50/60 Hz).  All system components shall be packed within the system for transport, including the equipment per the supplied systems packaging plan. Total packed weight of each individual system, with all components, shall not exceed 9500 lbs. The ELS shall support an expeditionary base camp size of 150 personnel by incorporating four (4) toilets, two (2) sinks and two (2) urinal troughs, divided into two (2) separate compartments and operate off of one 60A power input. The ESS shall provide a shower capability for an expeditionary base camp size of 150 personnel by incorporating four (4) shower stalls with user adjusted shower water spray temperature and four (4) personal hygiene sinks, divided into two (2) separate compartments, and operate off of one (1) 100A power input and one (1) 60A power input.  Target temperature at each shower head is 105 deg. F.  The EKS shall provide food serving and kitchen sanitation capability for an expeditionary base camp size of 150+ personnel by incorporating major components as follows:  one (1) cook and hold oven, one (1) half-oven, one (1) steamer, one (1) tilting steam jacketed kettle, one (1) griddle, one (1) counter-style refrigerator, three (3) serving/preparation tables, and one (1) three well sanitation system.  The hot water supply flow for general use shall be maintained between 110 F and 120 F.  The sanitation well of the sink shall have a separate water heater to maintain the sanitation water temperature at 180 F.  The EKS shall operate off of two (2)100A power inputs. The EBL shall provide laundry capability for an expeditionary base camp size of 150 personnel and, as such, shall incorporate one (1) 50-lb capacity washer and one (1) 75-lb capacity electric dryer.

System fabrication, assembly and integration shall conform to best commercial practices and applicable standards from NFPA, NSF, ANSI, ASME, ASSE, and IAPMO.  Materials and coatings shall be selected to provide effective resistance to wear, rust, decay, and deterioration.  Construction shall be such that the equipment is capable of withstanding extremely hard usage encountered in Military Service.  Examples of hard usage are as follows:  Cross country transportation, material handling onto transport vehicles, storage in harsh environments (salt air, UV, temperature and weather), operation in extreme temperature and humidity, and high altitude.  Some systems may be required to survive exposure to chemical contamination.  The contract effort(s) shall include development of technical manuals and other data associated with the logistical support of each system.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, (NPPTL) hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Ocenco, Inc. to procure Ocenco M-20 and EBA 6.5 Self Contained, Self-Rescuers (SCSR).
<p>Purpose and objective: Ther purpose of this action is to procure Ocenco M-20 and EBA 6.5 Self Contained Self-Rescuers (SCSR) for testing and evaluating, in the NIOSH Long-Term Field Evaluation.</p>
<p>Project Background: In order to minimize the probability of SCSR failures and subsequent miner deaths, NIOSH and it predecessor has conducted a program called the Long Term Field Evaluation program (LTFE). This program has been in place since the introduction of SCSR's over 20 years. Each year, NIOSH collects deployed SCSR's from active mines across the country and replaces those devices with new units of the same model and manufacturer. The number of each type collected is determined by their portion of the total population of SCSR's in use. Replacing the collected SCSR's with units of the same kind is necessary because each manufacturer's unit operates differently and miners at that mine must be trained on the specific device. Mixing of different models of SCSR at the mine would cause confusion and increased probability of death in an emergency. The collected SCSR's are taken to the National Personnel Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) where they are inspected and evaluated for their life support capacity. This program has identified many unexpected failures over the years of its operation that have resulted in massive recalls of SCSR's and improved SCSR designs. Miners' lives have been saved by units that would have likely failed if not upgraded due to the LTFE program.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12027. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Ocenco, Inc., 10225 82nd Street, Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>DME MAC Jurisdiction D Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a DME MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform numerous functions on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and shall establish relationships with suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS), for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor shall perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare FFS program. The Medicare FFS program's legal, policy and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor shall utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment and/or operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor shall coordinate its activities not only with CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from DMEPOS suppliers and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, as well as perform edits on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also conducts a variety of different supplier services, such as answering written inquiries, and educating them on Medicare's rules and regulations and billing procedures. The Contractor also operates Medicare's suppliers toll-free lines across the country to answer a wide-range of supplier questions. Additionally, the Contractor conducts redeterminations on appeals of claims and responds to complex beneficiary inquiries referred from the Beneficiary Contact Centers.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction D (comprised of the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, Mariana Islands, American Samoa) on or about March 22, 2010. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is April 22, 2010 with an anticipated award date of October 30, 2010.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

DSCP anticipates an Indefinite Quantity Contract with a two year base period and two 1-year options. The total estimated dollar value is $48M (inclusive of options). The contract resulting from this solicitation will be a Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) (05%) and will be conducted under the authority of FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in conjunction with FAR Part 15. This procurement will be a 50% Partial Set-Aside. Vendors will be invited to offer on any or all portions in which they meet the requirements of the solicitation; however, a successful awardee may not receive more than one award as the policy and procedures of FAR Part 6.202, Establishing or Maintaining Alternative Sources, will be utilized if needed. Inspection and Acceptance will take place at Origin and the RFP will be issued on an FOB origin basis.

This is a DVD contract for both CONUS and OCONUS locations. All 8 item descriptions are brand name or equal citing salient characteristics. The required delivery date will be 60 to 90 days depending on the size of the order. Smaller, high priority orders will require a shorter delivery date.

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4. It is a survey not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Businesses. A predecessor contract, # DTFACT-05-D-00009 was awarded to a Small Business in 2005. The FAA has an ongoing need for most of the tasks that were in the aforementioned contract. The FAA has revised and added tasks for better support of the Tower Siting Process. This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside competition to Small Businesses. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
In 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a revised Siting Order, 648.4A that required Line of Business to travel to the William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ to participate in real time Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) sitings. The success of each ATCT Siting requires the same consistent application of analysis and correct Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) evaluations. For each ATCT siting, time-sensitive preliminary reporting of TERPS impacts and data gathering and verification of the following approved FAA databases is required: 	-Aviation Standards Service (AVN)	-Information Systems (IS) &	- National Airspace Resource (NASR)
The contractor assists the siting team in selecting a site, within the required thirty minute response time that has little or no impact to any Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) into or out of the airport. In the location where SIAPs impact exists, the contractor recommends adjustments to the ATCT location or height to minimize or eliminate adverse impacts. The contractor is responsible for follow-up coordination with the appropriate offices within the FAA until the Air Space case is officially approved. 
Contractors must be qualified on the following requirements:1-	Contractor is required to have a minimum of five years experience in United States Standards for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS).2-	The contractor shall submit detailed information regarding Professional Qualifications and Specialized Experience in TERPs. The information shall, at a minimum, include key personnel (including experience and work history), applicable training, specific tasks/work completed related to TERPs, and if applicable any current TERPs projects.3-	The contract shall provide five examples of TERPs consulting in the last two (2) years.  The submitted information must include the following; the airport, nature of studies, dollar value, period of performance, point of contact at airport, and outcome of study if applicable. 
Interested companies are required to provide a capability summary of not more than eight pages that address the specific capabilities stated above and complete the attached Business Declaration form. 
Submissions of capability summaries are due by 2pm EST Thursday April 1, 2010. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement. Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration capabilities. Responses will not be returned. This is a sources sought announcement so NO solicitation exists. If a determination to set this requirement aside for Small Businesses is made, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from competition since, upon Contracting Officer decision, the solicitation may be released to qualified, responding Small Business.  The FAA may require qualified small business to participate in testing to confirm and validate the contractor possess the capabilities to meet the required 30 minute response time. Only contractors who meet the requirements will be requested to submit proposals. 
The North American Industry Code Standard for the work contemplates is 541511-Custom Computer Programming Services and the Small Business Size Standard is $25 million. 
A draft Statement of Work for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) is attached. 
All questions are to be submitted, via email, to harry.lutz@faa.gov not later than 2pm Eastern Standard Time March 25, 2010. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) intends to issue a sole source modification to extend the period of performance under contract DE-AC07-99ID13727 with Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI).  Due to unplanned delays in the selection process, more time is needed to complete all activities necessary for contract award and transitioning to a new Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) contract.  The current period of performance ends March 31, 2010.  DOE intends to extend the contract up to six (6) months (six (6) one-month options) through September 30, 2010.  The anticipated dollar value of the extension is $11M per month, up to a maximum of $67M.
The extension will enable DOE to meet the Settlement Agreement milestone of shipping 2,000m3 of transuranic waste out of the state of Idaho per year.  BBWI will continue to retrieve stored waste from the Transuranic Storage Area-Retrieval Enclosure and storage modules, and certity and/or ship approximately 660 cubic meters (m3) per month, up to a maximum of 4,000m3, of TRU waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.
The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion codified at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when only one responsible source exists and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  BBWI is uniquely qualified to carry out the AMWTP work through the extension because it has the management structure and correct mix of skilled workers in place to fulfill the requirements set forth by the Settlement Agreement and the Recovery Act work.
This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement.  Any responses must be received no later than 4:00 p.m., local prevailing time, March 19, 2010, to be considered.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>Improvement of the Accuracy of the Beta Dose Calculations in VARSKIN 3.1 Computer Code
<SOLNBR>RS-04-10-124
<CONTACT>Michael Mills, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 492-362`, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email michael.mills@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a full and open competition for the project entitled "Improvement of the Accuracy of the Beta Dose Calculations in VARSKIN 3.1 Computer Code."
<p><br />The objective of this contract is to customize the computer code VARSKIN 3 and NUREG/CR-6918 for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The current version of VARSKIN 3 does not accurately predict beta dose from some radionuclides for iron slab and iron sphere. The accuracy of the code is decreasing with skin depth. In order to address the above issues, NRC seeks to replace the current beta model in VARSKIN 3 to give the code the ability to accurately model beta dosimetry resulting from contamination on the skin or on protective clothing covering the skin. The secondary objective is to further develop and expand the code's functionality and usefulness to address foreseeable user needs after the contract has been completed. The proposed contract will be for a 19 month period of performance.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available on or about March 22, 2010 and the closing date for proposals will be on or about April, 21, 2010. The solicitation will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. The solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website. Therefore, interested parties are requested not to send letters, e-mails or faxes requesting copies of the RFP. Accordingly, telephone, mail, e-mail or fax requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any costs associated with responding to this solicitation. The size standard for this acquisition is an average of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS code 541330. Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small business, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The NRC encourages teaming arrangements utilizing FedBizOpps' Interested Vendors List (IVL) system, which will be enabled after the solicitation is issued.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. All responses should be directed to Jerrie Reed, at jerrie.reed@smdc.army.mil, and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The proposed contract action is for supplies or support that the government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is to negotiate a sole source contract, and is not a request for competitive proposals.  This synopsis is being issued for information purposes only. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation documents are not available.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA, 22134-5010,  intends to issue an 18 month extension, valued at $66,854,000.00, from 30 September 2010 until 31 March 2012 to General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), 8201 East McDowell Road, Scottsdale, AZ 85252-1417 under current terms and conditions of the contract M67854-02-C-2052, Combat Operation Center (COC) System. The extension planned includes the production of COC AN/TSQ-239 Versions 3 and 4 and post production support of initial spares, consumables, and training.  This extension will also include any necessary Engineering Change Proposal installs, retrofits, and refreshes, as well as any necessary On The Move (OTM) capabilities required. This extension is being executed to ensure that a production line is available to satisfy existing and continuing needs and requirements of the warfighter for the purpose of procuring any additional AN/TSQ-239(V) Combat Operations Centers (COCs) and life cycle management activities for the COC Systems to include previously fielded Capability Sets (CAPSETs) and possible future CAPSETs as required. 
GDC4S is the original source and developer of COC variants 2, 3, and 4, which are currently fielded and deployed in support of the warfighter's prosecution of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and other Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  GDC4S is also the original source for developing the COC SOA/SOI infrastructure proposed as a major operational configuration change to existing COCs. As such, contracting to a source other than GDC4S results in unacceptable delays adversely impacting the Marine Corps' Operating Forces. Therefore in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.", no other proposals will not be sought. No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however any interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement to Mr. Edward McGrail at edward.mcgrail@usmc.mil.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any questions regarding this announcement need to be addressed in writing to the contracting specialist listed in this announcement.  No phone calls will be accepted.  See number note 22.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.

Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.
The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.

OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee.

Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government.

The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.EMDS is an Army enterprise application that is used to automate the Force Management Office Force Validation Committee (FVC) process.  The FVC is an element of DAMO-FM, which conducts a cross-functional assessment of select Army units on a monthly basis.  This assessment offers current and predictive analysis based on authoritative sources of information for personnel, equipment, training, and stationing readiness at all levels.  The EMDS enterprise application allows the FVC to review more units in a shorter period of time, which allows for more timely information to be presented before the Vice Chief of Staff Army (VCSA) at the monthly Army Synchronization Meeting (ASM).  Additionally, EMDS provides a common operating picture of Army units before deployment, thereby increasing the likelihood of accuracy of unit readiness assessments.

<SUBJECT>Monitoring and Quality Control of the Capacity Building Assistance Program: Increasing Health Department and Community-based Organization Capacity to provide Evidence-based Interventions and HIV Prevention Strategies
<SOLNBR>SNRSS_81285
<RESPDATE>031810
<CONTACT>Sherrie N. Randall, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882866, Fax 7704882868, Email iom2@cdc.gov - Betty B Vannoy, Contract Officer, Phone 7704882891, Fax 7704882868, Email bbv9@cdc.gov
<DESC><br />This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide program evaluation services to assist the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP)/CBB in the monitoring and evaluation of the Capacity Building Assistance (CBA) Cooperative Agreement Program for up to 5 years. <br /><br />
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>CDC's DHAP provides CBOs with more than $300 million annually to conduct HIV prevention activities. In addition, DHAP's Capacity Building Branch (CBB) provides funds for CBA services in which considerable resources are allocated to serve CBOs, health departments, and CPGs nationwide. CBB provides national leadership and support for CBA to ensure that DHAP's grantees have the knowledge, skills and technology to effectively and efficiently conduct HIV prevention across the United States and its territories. Capacity building assistance means the provision of free (not for fee) information, training, technical assistance (TA), and technology transfer to individuals, organizations and communities to improve their capacity in the delivery and effectiveness of evidence-based interventions and core public health strategies for HIV prevention. CBA services do not include the direct delivery of HIV prevention services. <br /><br />CBA is provided to support grantees in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions and programs; building organizational infrastructure; and community mobilization to decrease stigma and increase HIV testing in high risk communities. DHAP has funded a CBA program since 1999. Prior to that, the program was not called CBA, it was called the National and Regional Minority Organizations (NRMO) Program. In all, DHAP has funded some form of capacity building strategy for DHAP grantees for approximately 12 years. <br /><br />Even though CBA has been funded for over 10 years, there has been no systematic assessment of CBA services provided to CBO and Health Department customers. No monitoring process to determine whether CBA customers were satisfied with CBA services has been initiated. In addition, there has been no evaluation of whether CBA services result in improved HIV prevention practice. Since these data are lacking, the CBA providers do not have adequate feedback on the quality of their work and may continue on a course for 4 or 5 years with no customer feedback to inform CBA quality assurance and to direct CBA program improvement. The CBB, as the major leader in CBA, is in the position to conduct such an evaluation and use this information to improve capacity building efforts by CBB grantees.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought is to assess vendor capabilities to provide program evaluation services to assist DHAP/CBB in the monitoring and evaluation of the CBA Cooperative Agreement Program which serves CBOs directly and indirectly funded by CDC, health departments and their CPGs, and other community stakeholders providing HIV prevention services targeting high risk and racial/ethnic minority populations to increase their capacity to implement evidence-based prevention practice based on the tasks outlined in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>Capability Statement:</p>
<p>Vendors that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the tasks outlined in the attached draft SOW are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The capability statements will be evaluated based on the information provided in relation to the objectives and requirements outlined in the attached draft SOW and the current in-house capacity to perform the work including: (a) staff availability, experience, and training; (b) prior completed projects of a similar nature; and (c) examples of prior completed contracts, dollar value of the contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women owned small business). The remainder of the capability statement should be tailored to the tasks outlined in the draft SOW and must demonstrate that similar work has been performed in the past.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statement (maximum 10 pages) via email to Sherrie Randall (srandall@cdc.gov). The subject line of the email shall be "Monitoring and Quality Control of the Capacity Building Assistance Program ". Responses are due no later than March 18, 2009 by 12:00PM EST. Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes:</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED ADEQUATE RESPONSES TO A SOLICITATION.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of firms to conduct an assessment of the Beasley Knob OHV trail system on the Chattahoochee National Forest in Union County, Georgia.  NO AWARD will be made from this Synopsis.  NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, do NOT request a copy of a solicitation.  Potential offerors having the skill, capability, and experience necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback via email as instructed below.  All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.

The project goals and objectives are summarized in the following four action items:
(1) INVENTORY -- Complete a 10.5 mile trail inventory, evaluating the current physical, social and managerial setting of the Beasley Knob OHV Trail System.  Conduct the inventory with the assistance of trail volunteers.  Utilize the inventory method as a means to also provide outdoor education where volunteer participants learn how to assess, repair, and maintain problematic trail sections.  The inventory phase will include extensive cooperation with both the public and agency personnel to help better understand the assessment process.  
(2) CLASSIFY -- For each Beasley Knob trail or trail segment, review the USFS Trail Fundamentals: Trail Type, Trail Class, Managed Use, Designed Use, and Design Parameters.  Classify/Reclassify each trail fundamental based on inventory findings.
(3) ASSESS -- Assess the content, character and condition of the Beasley Knob OHV Trails, focusing on two key criteria: recreational value and sustainability.  
(4) PLAN -- Develop a Trails Management Plan for the Beasley Knob OHV Trail System to provide a summary of findings and recommendations for future management.  The plan should include a conceptual trail layout plan that address sustainability, reroute alternatives, new trail loop connectors, and trail user recreational experience.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The Beasley Knob OHV Trail System is one of eleven OHV trail systems on the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest (CONF) which provide a total of 110 miles of trail riding. It is the only trail system on the CONF which allows for full-size passenger vehicles. The system accounts for approximately 10 percent of all off-road mileage and nearly 100 percent of full-size vehicle mileage available on the CONF. Interestingly, it also accounts for approximately 10 percent of off-road mileage available on public land in the entire state of Georgia considering that the U.S. Forest Service is the only governmental agency to offer this type of recreation on public land.
The Beasley Knob OHV Trail System provides approximately 10.5 miles of recreational riding for OHV enthusiasts.  The system is made up of interconnecting dirt trails, rock hill climbs and gravel roads through the Chattahoochee National Forest.  The system is recommended for experienced riders, only, because of its challenging terrain and steep ascents.  The trail system attracts recreationists from local Georgia communities, the metropolitan Atlanta area and surrounding states, especially those seeking to ride full-size four-wheel drive vehicles, such as jeeps and buggies.
There is clear evidence that the many sections of the trail system are not sustainable.  That is, they have a large impact on the natural surroundings, they have significant evidence of soil loss or movement, and they require extensive re-routing and long-term maintenance plans.  The focus of this assessment will be to promote environmental protection through the creation and maintenance of sustainable trails at the Beasley Knob OHV Trail System.  Close cooperation and participation with interested user groups and publics will be an important part of this assessment.  The affected user groups and any interested public participants will play an active role throughout all parts of the assessment.  The contractor will serve in a facilitator role throughout the process.  

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIES
Potential offerors having the skill, capability, and experience necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback by April 5, 2010 to Ms. Marcia O’Connor at moconnor@fs.fed.us.  
The respondent should provide the following information: 
(1)  Information regarding your firm's experience in and understanding of the project goals and objectives.
(2)   Project resumes with reference information, with particular emphasis on Forest Service trail assessment projects.
(3)  Key personnel experience and credentials.
(4)  Experience and success in involving volunteers, user groups and interested public participants.
(5)  Experience and capability to inventory, classify, assess, and make planning recommendations for Off-Highway Vehicle trail (OHV) systems or non-motorized trail systems. 
(6)  Use of geographic information systems (GIS) to support analysis.

<DESC>THIS PUBLICATION CONSTITUTES A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NO FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP), SOLICITATION, AND/OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THIS REQUEST WILL BE ISSUED.&nbsp; THE NAVAL RESEARCH LABORATORY (NRL) WILL NOT ISSUE PAPER COPIES OF THIS REQUEST.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE RESPONSES TO THIS RFI WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE PLANNING AND DEFINITION OF TECHNOLOGY INSERTION PROGRAMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT TO FUND ANY EFFORT SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUBMISSION OF MATERIALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST.&nbsp; <br /><br />This Sources Sought Announcement issued by NRL solicits industry and academic sources to express their capability to provide new technology capabilities that can augment/enhance current optical inspection systems for use in seawater, fuel/seawater compensated ballast tanks and fuel only tanks aboard U.S. Navy ships. As discussed in more detail below, NRL seeks both technology development and materials enhancement to increase current Navy optical inspection technique capability with particular focus to develop a "fuel certified" system. These systems are expected to see fleet wide surface ship utilization and incorporation into Navy maintenance planning and condition assessment procedures for structural and coatings performance.<br /><br />The currently developed Navy Insertable Stalk Inspection Systems (ISIS) and the Corrosion Detection Algorithm (CDA) are used to quantitatively assess seawater ballast tank coating condition and provide a trend analysis for maintenance planning. The ISIS system utilizes a video camera with an 18:1 optical zoom with a 1 lux sensitivity. The system currently utilizes two 35 Watt, 12 Volt halogen lamps with a 30 degree angular illumination. To change the direction of field of view, the system uses motorized pan and tilt controls. The camera, pan and tilt controls and the system lighting are controlled via an external portable computer via serial communication. In operation, the camera assembly and stalk are inserted into the tank, and secured to the ballast tank hatch; insertion depth is controlled by varying the pole length. Further, ISIS allows for repeatable follow-up inspection capability under computer control without the requirement for manned entry into the seawater tank. The computerized system takes a series of images (15 - 50) for subsequent analysis and assessment. The CDA provides a sophisticated assessment algorithm for determining coating damage and condition assessment. The current ISIS system is backpackable, portable and is powered by 120VAC.<br /><br />For this sources sought, contractors and vendors are encouraged to consider the following technology that can enhance the capability of the present ISIS technology for use in computerized tank inspection and specifically for use in intrinsically fuel safe operations: 1) fuel safe operation capabilities, including related intrinsically safe, explosion proof, purged/pressurized systems: enclosures, materials, cabling, connectors and associated components; 2) advanced Charge Coupled Diode (CCD) cameras/optical systems having at least a 10:1 integrated optical zoom capability, improved light sensitivity, ability to be controlled by an external PC and the ability to withstand industrial use; 3) small, high-output lighting systems having low input energy requirements and minimal heat generation; and 4) advanced pan and tilt drivers and motors. Key factors for selection of new technology include: ability for fuel safe equipment development/certification, lightweight components, compactness, low energy and systems integration. <br /><br />Submissions<br /><br />To minimize costs to potential contractors in responding to the subject announcement, each contractor is encouraged to submit an initial White Paper of no more than five (5) pages in length for the technology offered. A single source may submit multiple White Papers. White Papers may be submitted via e-mail to the Points of Contact Listed below. Alternatively hard copies (1 original + 2 copies) may be mailed to the Points of Contact. All White Papers must be received by the requested due date. <br /><br />Sources are encouraged to present optical inspection systems in one of three areas: 1) intrinsically safe containment, 2) camera/lighting, and 3) mechanical translation. The White Paper should (a) outline the proposed improvement/product, (b) present a rationale for use in ISIS systems, (c) provide a rough order of magnitude of the cost, and (d) performance specifications and requirements.
<p>In addition to complete product information/specification, each Source should also provide a two (2) page maximum resume or curriculum vitae for the Principal Investigator.<br /><br />The Navy requests that White Papers be provided no later than 1:00 p.m.&nbsp;Eastern on 15&nbsp;April 2010 with evaluation of products and Laboratory consideration on initial trial products by August 2010. &nbsp;Responses received after that time will not be reviewed.&nbsp; Information may be submitted via email, FEDEX, or UPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Postal Service continues to irradiate letters, flats, Express and Priority Mail with stamps for postage and other packages with stamps for postage destined to Government agencies in the ZIP Code ranges 202 through 205.&nbsp; Due to potential delays in receiving mail, use alternatives to mail when submitting white papers.<br /><br />Questions and white papers should be addressed to Mr. Keith Lucas, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6104, 4555 Overlook Ave SW, Washington, D C 20375 or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:keith.lucas@nrl.navy.mil">keith.lucas@nrl.navy.mil</a>.

IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROCUREMENT COMMITMENT BY THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  RESPONSE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR OR SUFFER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY IMPROPERLY IDENTIFIED INFORMATION.<BR>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of the industrys (both small and large) businesses to determine if there is a reasonable alternate source to the Monaco Transceiver Unit of the alarm system.  This synopsis is full and open to all business categories both large and small, both business categories are encouraged to submit responses. If a small business is responding, please identify any categories pertaining to your business: (certified 8(a), certified HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)). Responses are restricted to U.S. firms that are established and registered in Central Contract Registration (CCR). <BR><BR>SUBJECT:  Market Survey for Monaco Transceiver Unit  Sources Sought<BR><BR>The New York District intends to solicit and award up to seven construction projects on Fort Drum, NY, during the fiscal year of FY 2010 (Oct 09 thru Sep 10).  These projects will be solicited competitively under future solicitations.  However, each project will include a Brand Name Only component.  This notification serves three purposes:  (1) to notify potential offerors of the Armys intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project and (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) notification of the Armys intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monaco system is embedded in the Construction projects, which projects will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the projects requiring the Monaco system is sole source if no sources are able to provide a compatible system. In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.   This synopsis is for planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is the only document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the governments intent.  <BR><BR>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The BTX-F Fire Alarm Building Transceiver is functionally designed for specific Government fire department operations. Fort Drum currently uses the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  The Monaco Enterprises Inc. BTX-F Building Transceiver is the one piece of equipment best suited to meet the needs of Fort Drum.  Only this one model has been determined to be acceptable. Each proposed project currently includes the Brand Name fire alarm radio transceiver manufactured by Monaco Enterprises. These projects require reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm systems compatible with the installations base stations. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire reporting system is the best and the most economical system, and would be compatible with the existing system. It is paramount that any proposed replacement to the Monaco Enterprises Inc. BTX-F be carefully coordinated to maintain overall system integrity and capabilities. The required features of the BTX-F Fire Alarm Building Transceiver that must meet with a proposed substitute are as follows:<BR>" Hardwire line or narrowband radio communication with any of the D-21 Fire Management System <BR>" Narrowband radio is FCC certified for narrowband operation and meets the requirements of the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Frequency Management <BR>" Radio communication with the D-700 <BR>" Provides automatic and manual control of local or remote devices such as turning on pumps based on timed events, input from a fire alarm control panel, or manually activated from the D-21 <BR>" Provides eight relay driver outputs and four supervised zone inputs: <BR>" Eight onboard open-collector relay driver outputs can connect to the BT-X relay board or to relay coils that remotely control equipment such as pump activation inputs, HVAC dampers, lighting, door openers, runway barriers, and gates. These outputs can also drive remote annunciator LEDs <BR>" Four supervised fire zone inputs for connection to fire detection and monitoring devices located within 15 feet of the BT-XF; these are supervised for open (trouble), short (alarm), single-ground fault, and double-ground fault conditions <BR>" Four zone LEDs (one for each zone) reflect the condition of the zones: trouble, alarm, or normal <BR>" Status LEDs reflect the status of the BT-XF: general alarm, general trouble, system fault, in-communication, carrier detect, transmit, primary power, battery boost charge, and battery float charge <BR>" Supports up to 31 zone expansion backplanes into which fire expansion cards can be plugged <BR>" Each zone expansion card provides four zone inputs and eight relay outputs for connection to local or remotely located devices <BR>" Each expansion card has five LEDs: the PWR LED indicates power is being supplied to the card; the remaining four LEDs indicate the status of the four zone inputs <BR>" Each BT-XF can support up to 252 zones and 504 relay outputs with 62 expansion cards installed <BR>" One selectable RS-422/RS-485 port for communication with peripheral equipment or connection to a local access controller. An alternative use of this port is hardwire connection to multiple BT-XF units connected together for communication with the D-21 <BR>" Two full-duplex RS-232 ports used to program the BT-XF via connection to a laptop computer or for connection to peripheral equipment that does not have a RS-422 port/RS-485 port <BR>" 115 or 230 Vac power monitored with automatic switchover to backup battery power that provides standby power; the number of hours depends on the battery <BR>" Self test, stuck transmitter disconnect, reset, acknowledge, and battery reconnect switches <BR>" Local audible alert <BR>" Real-time clock and calendar <BR>" 1/2 MB of program memory <BR>" 1/2 MB of non-volatile data storage <BR>" Fits in a variety of enclosures; the enclosure size depends upon how many expansion cards are needed <BR>" Factory Mutual approved <BR>" 24/7 technical support and in-service training of Installation personnel for operation and maintenance.<BR>" Software compatible, or which can fully interface, with the current base wide system; Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.<BR><BR>    <BR>All interested businesses should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by 18 March 2010 2:00 pm (EST) eastern standard time.  Send responses to the US Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, ATTN:  Jason L Parker, New York, NY, 10278-0090 or by fax to (212) 264-3013.  This is NOT a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a result of this notice or to pay for any information received. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. Submittals will be used for market survey information only.<BR>

NAICS 423450 applies.Please see the Justification Below:FAR 6.302-1SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FORMAT(Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition)(a)	Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.  As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information.(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a Justification for other than full and open competition.            VANTHCS VISN 17, 4500 S. Lancaster Road, Dallas, TX  75216, for  Justification For Other Than Full And Open Competition. (2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.            This Justification and Approval is requested to procure a 5-Year contract for                                reagent instruments and reagents with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics.  This                         agreement will upgrade the existing Siemens AutoBlot HCV genotype testing                        instrument that is already on-site and in use in the Molecular Diagnostic                         laboratory.                        Procurement will be issued on a sole source basis for an estimated annual cost of                           $261,043.00, or $1,305,215.00 over a 5 year period.(3)	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value).                   This request is for a 5-Year reagent contract with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics                        to upgrade the existing Siemens AutoBlot HCV genotype testing instrument that                        is in use in the Molecular Diagnostics laboratory.                        The VANTHCS Molecular Diagnostics Lab currently uses a Siemens AutoBlot                        to perform HVC (Hepatitus C Virus) genotype testing for veteran patients, in                         addition to performing this testing for federal prisoners across the country, as                        part of our federal sharing agreement contract with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).                        This contract is up for renewal currently and VANTHCS must have the testing                        methodology in place in order to comply with the requirements of the contract.                        In addition, Siemens no longer manufactures the reagents that are used on the                        current Autoblot instrument; if the VANTHCS does not upgrade the instrument                        and obtain the Thermocycler, (an instrument that is necessary to the operation of                        the Siemens AutoBlot 3000H), VANTHCS will no longer be able to perform                         HCV testing for our veteran patients or our BOP patients.  There is no other                        manufacturer of this particular type of HCV genotyping testing.  The only                        other method to genotype HCV is by sequencing; however, this process is much                        more expensive and time consuming and VANTHCS would not be able to                          accommodate even our own veteran patient volume for HCV genotype                         testing using the gene sequencing method. (4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.The authority cited shall be 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement).(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited            There is no other manufacturer of this particular type of HCV genotyping            testing.  The only other method to genotype HCV is by sequencing; however,            this process is much more expensive and time consuming and VANTHCS would not be able to accommodate even our own veteran patient volume for HCV            genotype testing using the gene sequencing method.(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as may potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 (Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions) and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies.             This will be advertised on FEDBIZOPS per FAR 5.2.(7)	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.             It is the Contracting Officers determination that the anticipated cost, based            on commercial pricing, is fair and reasonable to the Government.              (8)	A description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results or statement of the reason market research was not conducted.                       No other market research was conducted because no other sources have been            identified;  the only 2 other manufacturers, Abbott Molecular and Third Wave            (now  Hologics), have removed their HCV genotyping test methods from the market.    (9)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:                                                n/a(10)	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.            No sources have expressed interest in the acquisition.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Shelter Technology, Engineering & Fabrication Directorate (STEFD), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Product Development and Analysis, Naperville, IL 60563.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>Product Development & Analysis LLC (PDA) has designed a low pressure/high volume pressure relief valve (PRV) for chemical/biological airlocks that will regulate airlock pressure automatically.  These PRVs will serve to replace the manually operated airflow gates currently installed in these airlocks for pressure regulation.  The training process to familiarize Soldiers with the airlock system could be drastically reduced if the pressure regulation was automatic instead of manual.  Additionally, the ease-of-use of the system would be enhanced, especially considering the lack of mobility afforded by most chemical/biological protective suits like the MOPP.  Lastly, the manufacturing process for the chemical/biological airlock could potentially be enhanced by integrating a simple automatic pressure relief valve as opposed to a more complex series of holes and flaps, louvers, etc.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>PDA is the only company that could be located that designs and produces PRVs that allow high volume airflow while operating at low pressure.  Typical PRVs operate at either high pressure/high volume, or low pressure/low volume, so PDAs design is rather unique.  Additionally, PDA has already designed and manufactured a very similar airlock PRV, the design of which just needs to be slightly modified to achieve the operating conditions desired for this purpose.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>An internet search of PRV suppliers was performed and (as stated above) the vast majority of PRVs available on the commercial market are high pressure/high volume or low pressure/low volume, neither of which will suffice for the chemical/biological airlock system in question. <BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>None<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>The airlock PRV developed by PDA will be a prototype to be used for evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the airlock system with this new technology installed.  Should this item prove effective in its operation and a valid enhancement to the existing system, future procurements of the devices would take place under full and open competition, using performance characteristics developed during evaluation of the prototype.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: stephen.reffel@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 am on March 10, 2010.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Stephen Reffel, Contract Specialist<BR>Stephen.reffel@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with the incumbent provider Equinix for temporary data center services.  The SEC has a requirement for a short term bridge contract for uninterrupted data center services which can be provided only by the incumbent vendor.  The firm period will be for up to twelve months, with a four month extension option and a right to terminate earlier if called for.  The incumbent provider is the only source capable of satisfying the SEC’s requirement for uninterrupted data center services during this time period.  The SEC will be using this time period to pursue a full and open competition for the SEC’s long-term data center requirements.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1 – Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The SEC intends to award a contract to Equinix on or about March 15, 2010.  The estimated value of this action is $2,823,103.40.  This notice is not a competitive request for proposals.  A competitive solicitation will not be issued and no further information will be provided.  However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER (PSC/HHS)&nbsp;2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTS.
<p>On February 16, 2009, Title XIII - Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was established. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within the Department of Health and Human Services is charged with the development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information.</p>
<p>One central aspect of HITECH is the privacy and security of personally identifiable health information. Specifically, HITECH &sect;13402(h)(2) requires that annual guidance is issued specifying the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals (as it relates to breach notification). As such, this contract will be a key aspect of HHS' continued effort to address these efforts. This contract will identify and assess technologies and methodologies that allow individually identifiable health information to be rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. This statement of work directs the contractor to:<br />1. Identify existing and emerging technologies and methodologies that allow individually identifiable health information to be rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. <br />2. Once relevant technologies are identified, assess, using scientifically valid methods, the effectiveness of these technologies and methodologies, including the ability and ease of re-identifying information.<br />3. Deliver to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) a 508 compliant report that provides an overview of the work and provides detail into the identification and testing of relevant technologies. The final report shall be no longer than thirty (30) pages in length, exclusive of any charts or supporting materials.</p>

<p>The MicroHound<sup>TM</sup> combines, in a single platform, small chemical sensors with large-volume sampling and preconcentration to detect low levels of chemicals.  In particular, patented, leading edge technologies enhance the MicroHound<sup>TM</sup> system's ability to collect and identify explosives and narcotics.  As an integrated package, the MicroHound<sup>TM</sup> system operates in either of two modes: non-contact vapor mode or swipe mode.  In vapor mode, the sampling unit "puffs" the item being inspected and draws in a large volume of air, concentrating heavy organic compounds from the air stream onto a filter.  In swipe mode, the operator swipes a suspicious object's surface with a filter and places the filter into the MicroHound<sup>TM</sup> systems for analysis.  The device can also enhance the real-world detection capabilities of many detectors by delivering a concentrated sample to the detector.</p>
<p>To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail to Tracey Norris by 16 April 2010 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0114, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115, E-mail: tanorri@sandia.gov, Phone: (505) 284-3557. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.  Include company and contact information, as well as a description of how your company meets Sandia's criteria and could best contribute to the formation of a CRADA partnership or license and the subsequent commercialization of this technology.  Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): MSTechnology Inc. Contract W91278-06-C-0052, Carters Lake Operation & Maintenance of Gov't Owned Facilities<br><br>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0052, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursement Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Carters Project, Chatsworth, GA, awarded to M. S. Technology, Inc., 137 Union Valley Road, Oakridge, Tennessee. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  Contract Clauses required for projects involving Recovery funds have been incorporated into the contract. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561210 applies to this contract award.   Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for. The contractor shall:  1) For Project Office/Visitor Center: replacement of the staff break room cabinets and appliances; installation of a landscape irrigation system; improvements in thermal installation fenestration, hot water, electrical and security systems. 2) For Ranger Shop:    Evaluate fire separation requirements between storage room and office in keeping with NFPA 101 requirements; Evaluate thermal resistance and vapor barrier; Provide on-demand in-line water heating. 3) For Operations and Maintenance Contractor Building: Provide exterior wall rating R 20 with ceiling rating R 30; Coordinate required resistance with as built and determine extend of required upgrades; Install insulation; Replace windows with high-efficient insulated units; Evaluate the existing HVAC System and redesign to meet federal, state and local codes; Evaluate the existing HVAC system for humidity contract and recommend and design upgrades. This existing contract must be used because for the following reasons:  1) The extent of the work and the resources required can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each site.  2)  The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures.  3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budgets guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although Mobile Districts contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Governments risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.<BR>

<p>The USSS currently expects to perform a predecessor acquisition in advance of the complete Block 1 initiative.&nbsp; The purpose of this separate task will be the rapid acquisition of hardware elements and their installation, configuration and integration into the current USSS IT infrastructure.&nbsp; This acquisition is to ensure that current IT assets continue to function effectively and seamlessly while the remainder of the Block 1 initiative proceeds through the various phases of the acquisition process.&nbsp; This acquisition will also include an analysis and study effort to assist with the Government's development of the IIT program.</p>
<p>The initial predecessor acquisition is presently planned to be conducted via an existing U.S. Government acquisition vehicle for efficiency purposes.&nbsp; Current expectations are to conduct this separate task via the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading-Edge Solutions (EAGLE) Functional Category 1 (Infrastructure Engineering Design, Development, Implementation and Integration) contract vehicle.&nbsp; This notice is provided as guidance only for the information of interested parties and is subject to change.&nbsp; Additional EAGLE contract information, including contract awardees' information, may be found at:</p>
<p>http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/opportunities/gc_1249919931406.shtm</p>
<p>The USSS continues to plan for the Block 1: IT Infrastructure Modernization, Database Architecture and Maintenance and Cyber Security initiative to be acquired via an anticipated unrestricted open market acquisition conducted via FBO.&nbsp; Latest schedule projections indicate that this acquisition will take place in the last quarter of 2010 although this projection is subject to change.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the USSS encourages interested parties to frequently monitor FBO for future notices of the complete Block 1 initiative.</p>

<p><br />Description</p>
<p>OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees. The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information. Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures. ATF will provide these regulations to the contractor.<br /><br />ATF has determined that the most efficient and cost-effective method of conducting such investigations is to employ the services of contract investigators. Therefore, ATF has established a program to use trained, experienced investigators to conduct investigations. Typically, though not exclusively, the contractors are retired federal investigators who have at least three (3) years of current experience conducting personnel security background investigations. ATF utilizes the services of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to contract directly with investigators.</p>
<p>Contractors must undergo and receive a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), for a Public Trust position, to determine their suitability to access ATF information, information technology and facilities. Unless determined by the Personnel Security Branch (PSB), that a clearance is required, contractors will not be issued a security clearance. The investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish. The contractor is advised that this investigation may take ninety (90) days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues. If a contractor has a current SSBI with another agency, the PSB will follow reciprocity procedures for security; however, a review to determine the contractor's compliance with all ATF agency specific requirements will be conducted prior to authorizing access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities. ATF will conduct a Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five (5) years.</p>
<p>Contractors are hereby notified that they are responsible for taking direction from ATF, PSB In House Special Investigators, or other designee(s), as authorized by the program's internal COTR.</p>
<p>Contractors are assigned the majority of their work within their listed location (50/75 miles from residence) and up to a 200-mile radius of their residence. On occasion ATF may request contractors to accept work assignments involving travel to other regions in the United States. ATF makes work assignments on the basis of workload, volume of work determined by location, quality of work, and financial considerations as the needs of ATF dictate.</p>
<p>Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested without prior notification. To request time off, a minimum of two (2) weeks' notice is required. Work assignments are required to be completed by the due date determined by ATF. Internal reviews of contractors' performance are conducted annually, although ATF may increase the frequency of reviews to every six (6) months.</p>
<p>Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF. To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired. Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance may be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the BPA being terminated. Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected. Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.</p>
<p>ATF pays contractors for investigative assignments based on the point system. The point payment rate is currently set at $43.00 per point. With the exception of the personal security interview, and PIV, ATF will pay Contractors $13.25 per page for reports they prepare using the ReportWriter software program.</p>
<p>Contractors will be required to conduct interviews, take accurate notes of those interviews, and reduce those notes to writing in the form of a Report of Investigation (ROI). Each contractor is responsible for ensuring that all of their reports are neatly prepared, grammatically correct, free of spelling errors, correct in format and most importantly, factually accurate. Repeated inaccuracies will result in the BPA being terminated. ROIs must objectively present the facts as discovered during the investigation.</p>
<p>With each assignment, contractors shall be tasked to complete one or more of the following investigative requirements:</p>
<p>1. Personal security interview;<br />2. Verify identity and citizenship status;<br />3. Verify employment through records and interviews;<br />4. Verify claims of residence through records and interviews;<br />5. Verify attendance at educational facilities through records and interviews;<br />6. Conduct personal interviews with references;<br />7. Develop and interview additional sources;<br />8. Conduct military record reviews;<br />9. Conduct law enforcement checks;<br />10. Verify and review public records; and/or<br />11. Expand the investigation as necessary.</p>
<p>Each assignment will specify the following:</p>
<p>1. The work to be performed by the contractor;<br />2. The place(s) where the work is to be performed;<br />3. An assignment initiation date;<br />4. A due date determined by the response type (i.e. routine or priority); and<br />5. The number of estimated points.</p>
<p>Assignments must be conducted and completed by the contractor directly and not re-assigned by the contractor to any other individual contractors, employees or sub-contractors. ATF will reimburse contractors for mileage when they use their personal automobile to perform assignments, ATF will reimburse contractors for mileage driven at the prevailing rate established by the General Services Administration.</p>
<p>ATF will pay per diem and expenses for required travel when specifically authorized. Per diem rates shall correspond with Federal Travel Regulation, Title 41 CFR, Chapter 301.</p>
<p>In compliance with ATF's invoicing procedures, contractors must submit a request for payment detailing the number of miles driven, as well as any other incidental expenses, in connection with any particular assignment. Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF.</p>
<p>ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services. This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations. Consequently, contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract. Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.</p>
<p>In order to receive assignments and to complete the required ROI, each contractor will be provided an ATF laptop computer. Once a contractor receives their BPA and credentials, they will be required to travel to the nearest ATF field office to receive and set up the laptop. Contractors will be provided detailed instructions at that time. Reimbursement for laptop pick up and any other issues or travel related to the ATF laptop will be reviewed on a case by case basis and determined by the PSB.</p>
<p>The laptop will be fully imaged in accordance with the requirements established by the PSB and the ATF, Office of Science and Technology (OST). The laptop must only be used to process and maintain ATF information.</p>
<p>ATF will issue the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Laptop (with 14' or 15' screen)<br />&bull; Keyboard<br />&bull; Mouse<br />&bull; Power Cord<br />&bull; Laptop bag<br />&bull; Battery (lasting 3 hours)<br />&bull; Token (required to log into ATF laptop)<br />&bull; ATF email address<br />&bull; User ID and password<br />&bull; 24/7 Helpdesk access<br />&bull; All necessary ATF systems</p>
<p>Currently, ATF utilizes a software program by the name of "ReportWriter" to prepare ROIs. This program will be provided on the ATF laptop.</p>
<p>Due to security concerns, the ATF laptop is the only computer to be utilized for submission and receipt of ATF field assignments and to correspond with the PSB. Contractors are prohibited from processing ATF information on a personal computer or other non-ATF approved system. Contractors will be required to complete Information Security Awareness Training on an annual basis. The training is provided free of charge through LearnATF and will be accessible through the ATF laptop. This annual training and any other mandatory training required hereafter, will be required to retain a BPA and training time will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Effective with this solicitation and all amendments hereafter, any contractor offered a BPA will be required to have a personal printer and scanner; a monitor is not required. It is the responsibility of the contractor to purchase printers, scanners, and/or monitors. ATF and the PSB are not responsible for the purchase, maintenance or repair for these technical items and the contractors will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with them. Contractors are permitted to connect personal printers, scanners and monitors to the ATF laptop with assistance from the ATF Helpdesk. Any questions or issues that arise regarding the laptop (i.e. technical, damage) must be directed to the ATF Helpdesk or by following established guidelines as provided by the PSB. A telephone number for the helpdesk will be provided with the laptop.</p>
<p>Computer security updates will be pushed to the laptop from OST. When contractors log into the computer via the ATF Virtual Private Network (VPN) through their existing internet connection, contractors may occasionally be given instructions to restart the computer due to critical security updates. Contractors must follow these prompts, as security updates are necessary to ensure proper security features and functionality with the laptop.</p>
<p>Due to connectivity issues, contractors who do not have broadband internet connections, such as cable or Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), must notify the PSB prior to award. The following information must also be provided to the PSB:</p>
<p>&bull; Connection provided by: dial up or satellite;<br />&bull; Company/Vendor providing the internet service; and<br />&bull; Is there cell phone coverage in the area? If so, what companies provide cell service? What is the average signal strength?</p>
<p>*Note: Wireless connection capability will not be guaranteed by ATF or the PSB.</p>
<p>Contractors not willing to utilize the ATF laptop and take the annual Information Security Awareness training will be unable to obtain a BPA with ATF.</p>
<p>The ATF laptop and the information it contains is the property of ATF; at the conclusion of the BPA (or when so directed by the PSB), the ATF laptop and information contained therein must be returned to ATF.</p>
<p>Contractors must also purchase a facsimile machine (to send and receive faxes from home or home-office) and a paper shredder to destroy documents, notes, and other case related material after 90 days.</p>
<p>Contractors are responsible for implementing changes to procedures and policies as directed by an ATF representative. These changes will be distributed via email and posted to a secure investigator website. It is the contractor's responsibility to fully read and follow written direction. Implementing changes will ensure compliance with mandates as set by ATF, the PSB, OPM and/or OMB.</p>
<p>Contractors will be required to sign a Certification in conjunction with the ATF P 7500.1, Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users, agreeing to the terms and provisions set forth in ATF P 7500.1.</p>
<p>Contractors will retain all notes and other investigative materials for 90 days after the report is submitted, at which time all paper copies will be shredded and all data files shredded in accordance with ATF security requirements.</p>
<p>Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification which declares that any submission of a Contractor's request for payment and any supplemental material, whether submitted in hard copy or electronic format, represent actual reported investigative work that was performed and conducted in compliance with the requirements of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 for Investigation Services. The contractor must list that code in their CCR registration for ATF to consider them for this requirement.</p>
<p>Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States at their own expense. Conferences are usually limited to one (1) per year.</p>
<p>ATF intends to issue, to multiple contractors, a BPA that will be available for placing calls/orders. A BPA may be awarded to various contractors throughout the United States depending on location and ATF workload. Proposals will be accepted beginning March 5, 2010 through March 30, 2015.</p>
<p>All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors. ATF's objective is to provide a sufficient number of sources, geographically distributed, to ensure prompt and efficient performance of background investigations. ATF reserves the right to retain all proposal materials for any vendor that is denied based on geographic location only. As the needs of the Contract Background Investigation Program change, vendors who were previously denied based on their geographic location, may be reconsidered for an award.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the Federal Personnel Security program, changes in policies, procedures and guidelines are subject to change without notice. Therefore, the ATF and the PSB reserve the right to modify the Statement of Work and Points and Payment Schedule at any time. All vendors currently contracted under a BPA and any new contractors thereafter, agree to adhere to any new or updated requirements, policies and/or procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation is also subject to change without prior notification. Therefore, any interested vendors should ensure they are in receipt of and submitting their proposal following the current requirements and guidelines found in the most recent posting/modification/amendment. This solicitation will remain open during the established five year period; however, ATF reserves the right to amend this solicitation and include proposal submission periods to incorporate opening and closing dates.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued to state that any individual BPA that is awarded will be for sixty (60) months from the time of award. After which time, all current contractors with a BPA must apply through a new solicitation to be awarded a BPA for another 60 months.</p>
<p>Contractors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA. A BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected contractors are in a position to furnish, and as such, eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods. There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity. Calls/orders may be competed among all contractors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF COTR. ATF will reimburse contractors based on the rates as outlined in the current Statement of Work and Points and Payment Schedule.</p>
<p>Contractors are hereby informed that if offered a BPA, the contractor is responsible for filing their own state and Federal taxes. ATF will provide a 1099-Misc tax form to qualified contractors. The ATF is not required to provide a 1099-Misc form to any vendor who is incorporated and/or does not receive at minimum of $600 during any calendar year.</p>
<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full force: FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror - Commercial Items (Oct. 00) and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference). Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications-can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov. Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.</p>
<p>EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.</p>
<p>Capability of the Vendor.</p>
<p>ATF will consider awarding a BPA to a contractor, as needed, based on past performance and experience, the contractor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the point payment rate), and location needs. All contractors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated SSBI, and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration, and sign the certification attached to ATF P 7500.1. These are mandatory requirements and any offeror will be eliminated that fails to comply with them. Contractors will be initially screened by location and then on a pass/fail basis for acceptability. An interview may also be required. A maximum of 100 points can be awarded and at least 36 points must come from Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 30 points must come from Capabilities. Contractors rated as "passed" will be awarded points for past performance and experience. Contractors that meet the mandatory requirements and receive the highest scores will be considered for issuance of a BPA.<br /><br />a. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (55 Points maximum): Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing. A minimum of three (3) years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended. ATF will evaluate each contractor's experience on the basis of its breath, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting investigations in the federal environment and experience conducting personnel security investigations (including overseas experience). ATF may assess the contractor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of how well a contractor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.

<DESC><p>PRE SOLICIATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research (DSR) Protective Technology Branch ( PTB), Morgantown, WV has a requirement for Side Impact Testing of Type I/III and Type II Ambulances.</p>
<p>This requirement is solicited as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>No government-wide notes apply. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a Federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for professional services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this requirement is 000HCCJC-2010-79310 and is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using FAR Subpart 13.1 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirement, please either fill in the dollar amounts or provide a separate excel spreadsheet containing the same information:<br />CLIN 0001: Total Price:<br />Side Impact Testing $<br />Development of a detailed instrumentation and test plan to support the creation of four side impact crash test pulses. <br />The period of performance for this effort is delienated in the Statement of Work under reporting schedule.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK <br />for the <br />Side Impact Testing of Type I/III and Type II Ambulances</p>
<p>I. Background <br />The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (NTEA-AMD), is working to improve worker safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. One outcome of this collaborative effort has been the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones". <br />Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient gurney, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have already developed an SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice (draft in review) to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely excluded from this requirement. <br />This proposed SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" has been approved for balloting by SAE for further development and is now in its final revision. Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, this contract is geared to develop such a dataset to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact testing (proposed).</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract <br />This contract will create the needed ambulance side impact dataset.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work <br />The Contractor will be responsible for the development of a detailed instrumentation and test plan to support the creation of four (4) side impact crash test pulses. Further, once approved, the Contractor will execute the test plan. The primary pieces of data derived from this testing, four pulses showing vehicle response over time, will be used by the NIOSH/NTEA-AMD team to develop a side impact test corridor suitable for inclusion in an as yet to be developed "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment."</p>
<p>Should additional funding be identified from sources such as seating, restraint, or gurney manufacturers, the contract may be expanded to include instrumented manikins in the patient compartment using existing or modified seating, restraint or gurney components.</p>
<p>Given the collaborative nature of this contract and the expectation costs will be shared by two or more partners, the Contractor will be expected to ensure all partners are aware of individual manufacturer requests - as funding indicates. As the Contracting Agency, NIOSH must be informed of any requests from partners for additional tasking that may affect costs. The Contractor will not be expected to proceed on any partner request without written approval from NIOSH. Likewise, NIOSH will not assume responsibility for any change in the contract's cost without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer. Thus, the Contractor will be expected to work very closely with the NIOSH Project Officer and his counterpart at the NTEA-AMD to ensure all tasking is approved prior to incurring costs.</p>
<p>IV. Technical Requirements <br />Description of Specific Tasks or Phases: <br />The Contractor shall prepare a detailed proposal with line item costs for each of the tasks described below: <br />1. The Contactor will take receipt of two ambulances (a Type II and a Type I or III) as provided by industry partners. Appropriate documentation will be completed to transfer ownership from each industry partner to the Contractor without charge to the industry partner or sales payment by Contractor. <br />2. All industry partner markings, inside and out, will be obscured by the Contractor. <br />3. The vehicles will be prepared for impact testing in accordance with industry practices, FMVSS, and EPA requirements to provide for the safe handling of the vehicle and any hazardous fluids or materials. Appropriate documentation will be prepared by the Contractor to ensure compliance. <br />4. The contractor will work with the ambulance providers (industry partners) to identify the fore/aft, lateral, and vertical cgs of the full vehicle including the patient compartment and the patient compartment separate from the vehicle's chassis. <br />5. The contractor will develop a test plan that mirrors the impact requirements delineated in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Side Impact Crashworthiness Evaluation Crash Test Protocol (Version V), dated May 2008. <br />6. The contractor will instrument each of two test vehicles (as provided by NTEA-AMD partners) in accordance with the vehicle and patient compartment instrumentation described in the illustration below (this instrumentation configuration is pulled from SAE 2007-01-4267: Crash Testing of Ambulance Chassis Cab Vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please see attachment for pictures.</p>
<p><br />7. The Contractor will acquire 4 moving deformable barriers (MDB) as defined by the IIHS protocol. <br />8. The Contractor will conduct side impact crash testing twice on each vehicle: once on the curb side and once on the street side of each vehicle. <br />9. The strike location on the Type II shall be as follows: <br />a. Curb Side: Centered at combined chassis and patient compartment cg. <br />b. Street Side: Centered at the cg of the patient compartment only. However, if the positioning of the impact point at the cg of the patient compartment would allow the moving deformable barrier to impact the rear axle, the centerline of the impacting MDB shall be moved forward to allow the full MDB face to interact with the vehicle body forward of the axle.</p>
<p>10. The strike location on the Type I or III will be at the cg of the full vehicle (chassis and patient compartment as long as the centerline of the impacting MDB fully engages the patient compartment before impacting the cab of the vehicle. This impacting location will be used on both the curb and street side of the vehicle.</p>
<p>11. All measurements should be recorded and filtered according to the most recent version of SAE J211-1 and J211-2.</p>
<p>12. All instrumented data shall be provided in electronic spreadsheet format.</p>
<p>13. High speed video coverage of each test will be provided with a large enough field of view (perhaps both overhead and on the impacting side of the vehicle) to allow the full travel of impacted vehicle to be seen. Video data shall be provided in its original form and as reduced fidelity and slowed .mpg or .avi not to exceed 0.1 GB per video clip for use by the project team in a variety of presentation materials.</p>
<p>14. Once authorized to do so, the Contractor will complete all necessary documentation to dispose of each vehicle such that neither of these vehicles can reenter service.</p>
<p>V. <br />Reporting Schedule and End Products/Deliverables</p>
<p>This contract will have a two deliverables. Due Date Description of Deliverable and overall schedule <br />April 15, 2010 (Estimated dates) A draft test plan will be developed summarizing instrumentation location, calibration ranges, impact location, and all related and applicable SAE, FMVSS, AMD, or similar standards used to describe test criteria, instrumentation type, and instrument location. <br />April 31, 2010 (Estimated dates) All testing complete. <br />May 30, 2010 (Estimated dates) A summary test report which properly identifies all instrumentation locations, calibration limits, as well as, appropriate testing protocol and standards as needed to accurately describe and perhaps recreate testing. A full electronic data set on DVD(s) with all accelerometer data (filtered and</p>
<p>VI. Special Considerations</p>
<p>The Contractor must recognize funding for this project will be shared and thus provided to the Contractor by a variety of sources. In addition to NIOSH, the list of potential funding partners may include the NTEA-AMD, individual ambulance manufacturers, seat manufacturers, restraint manufacturers, and gurney manufacturers. While NIOSH will write the broad contract to cover the dynamic testing of two ambulances, individual partners may, with mutual consent, ask for and be granted the opportunity to "piggy-back" testing of their components (seats, gurneys, etc.), as installed in the interior of each ambulance, during full-scale testing of each ambulance. NIOSH will assist in the negotiation of a fair and equitable contribution for each partner depending upon their level of participation. However, NIOSH will not assume responsibility for the payment of any jointly negotiated payment beyond that expressly identified by NIOSH as representing its share of the test program. <br />The NTEA-AMD, through the generous donations of its members or other entities, will provide the test articles (2 ambulances). At no point will NIOSH nor the NTEA-AMD be listed as the title holder of record for either vehicle during the contracted test period. Rather, it is expected that the Contractor (test facility) will take possession of each test article from the donating organization. Once testing is complete and all test results documented, the Contractor will be responsible for the proper disposal of all test articles, including vehicles. <br />Your quote shall include the following:<br />&bull; Total proposed price <br />&bull; Capability Statements in accordance with the Statement of Work<br />&bull; Evaluation Criteria<br />Evaluation Criteria: <br />1. The degree to which the test facility has a quality assurance program that adequately ensures test equipment calibration, maintenance and record keeping is in order and fulfills the government's requirements.<br /><br />The test facility shall provide a copy of their quality assurance program and calibration records for those pieces of equipment proposed for this testing.</p>
<p>2. The degree to which the calibration records for those pieces of equipment proposed for this testing are within acceptable tolerances.</p>
<p>3. The degree to which the Contractor demonstrate their ability to perform the IIHS Side Impact Crash Test Protocol. This may be demonstrated in one of two ways:</p>
<p>a. Provide a copy of a test report from a previously executed IIHS Side Impact Crash Test, or</p>
<p>b. Provide a copy of a test report from a previously executed FMVSS 214 Side Impact Test</p>
<p>*** The report shall cover testing of, and instrumented data collect from, a full vehicle impacted by a moving deformable barrier matching either the IIHS Protocol or the FMVSS 214 test.</p>

It is suggested you provide a pre-addressed stamp envelop to former clients for their use in submitting their Performance Questionnaire. See section Past Performance References for additional information. <BR>       Offerors are advised that the Government may use all data provided by the offeror in this quote and data obtained from other sources, to include but not limited to Governmentwide databases, in the development of performance assessments.  While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete Past Performance information rests with the offeror. <BR><BR>Award will be made to a qualified offeror deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose quote conforms to all the synopsis/solicitation requirements and is judged to represent the Best Value to the Government.  This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror; where the Contracting Officer determines that the Past Performance of the higher-priced offeror outweighs the cost difference.  To arrive at a Best Value decision this acquisition will utilize the FAR Part 13.106-2 evaluation of quotations or offers.<BR><BR>Past Performance Evaluation:  The past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offerors ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offerors demonstrated present and past performance record under existing and prior contracts over the past three years for similar services. The government will evaluate the offerors demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet users needs, including cost and schedule. General trends in the Contractors performance will be considered. <BR>   The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of this synopsis/solicitation. Emphasis will be placed on recent, relevant experience. The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained. A relevancy determination of the offerors present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its subcontractors or teaming partners involvement) will be made. The Government is not bound by the offerors opinion of relevancy. <BR>   The Government may consider an offerors contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offerors present and past performance lend itself to this approach. For example, an offerors work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort. However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort. The following relevancy criteria apply: <BR>       VERY RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities, which are essentially what this solicitation requires. <BR>       RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. <BR>       NOT RELEVANT: Did not involve any significant aspects of above. <BR>   In assessing present and past performance an overall confidence assessment rating will be made. The following performance confidence assessment ratings apply: <BR>Rating Definition <BR>High Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has high confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Significant Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has significant confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal Contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. <BR>Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). <BR>Little Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>No Confidence Based on the offerors performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <BR>   <BR>Price Evaluation:  The price quote shall initially be reviewed for compliance with the synopsis/solicitation. The Contracting Officer may complete the compliance review prior to the evaluation of Past Performance and offers that fail to meet the compliance requirements will not be evaluated and will be eliminated from the competition.  The purpose of the Price evaluation is to provide an assessment of the reasonableness and realism of the proposed price/cost in relation to the solicitation requirements. Quotes will be evaluated in the following manner:  Reasonableness will be determined IAW FAR 13.106-3. <BR>   A Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The Total Evaluated Price will be formulated as follows: <BR>       For CLIN 0001 the Contracting Officer will multiply the cost per breakfast meal by 18,411.<BR>       For CLIN 0002 the Contracting Officer will multiply the cost per dinner meal by 18,411.<BR>       For CLIN 0003 the Contracting Officer will multiply the cost of warming beverages by 18,411.<BR>       For CLIN 0004 will be added to the TEP.<BR>       Offerors are cautioned against submitting a quote that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more schedule items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of analysis techniques. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced. <BR><BR>FAR 52.212-3 (Alt 1), Offerors Representations and Certifications, Commercial Items (Offerors shall include a completed copy as part of their quote or a completed registration on the ORCA website (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx), 52.212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders (DEVIATION).  52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires.

REQUIREMENT:  PCP:2008-09 Annual Report

PRODUCT:   98 text pages plus a 4 page cover printed in six ink colors.

BASIS FOR AWARD:   The actual award amount will be $60,000 for this contract. Our objective is to obtain the highest possible quantity for this dollar amount. Your added rate per thousand “over’s” may be used to either increase or decrease your firm’s quoted price to reach this dollar amount. Failure to provide an added rate will render your firm’s quotation non-responsive.

QUALITY:   Level 1 printing and finishing attributes are required for this specification. Reference GPO publication 310.1 for attribute requirements. Printing is the predominate production function and none shall be subcontracted. All contractors submitting a quotation shall have passed the NCI Requirements for New

QUANTITY:  10,000 copies and the final film/files as required in the production of printing.

TRIM SIZE:  8-3/8” x 10-7/8”, lay-flat binding along the 10-7/8” dimension.

PROOFS: Provide a laminated, digital, halftone-dot proof, stripped to show the full press sheet imposition, including colorbar, showing guide, gripper and ruled-up for all bindery marks on each form. Proofs shall have a PIA/GATF Proof Comparator (or similar process control) affixed to the back or face of the proof. Spot colors shall be a match of the Pantone reference books on the laminated proof (with ink draw downs provided for approval, on the proposed substrates). Additionally, provide two inkjet “dylux-styled reader” proofs, with all elements in proper position, folded and trimmed to final size. NCI shall keep one (1) digital dylux.

PAPER:   Cover – 80 lb. white premium coated offset recycled cover, minimum brightness of 94+ (Centura Silk, McCoy Silk, or Utopia One-X dull)

Text – 80 lb. white premium coated offset recycled text, minimum brightness of 94+ (Centura Silk, McCoy Silk, or Utopia One-X dull)

Only those papers listed above as approved equals will be considered. See the 43rd. edition
(May 2009 issue) of the Competitive Grade Finder. Both the text and cover stocks, when
required, must be the same brand name items, and all the leaves within each book must be
matching. American mill brand manufactured papers only, private label papers and or foreign
manufactured papers shall not be acceptable.

INKS: Four color process, PMS 298 (Blue) PMS 3393 (Green) and dense Black Ink. Inks shall contain minimum percentages of vegetable oil in compli¬ance with federal procurement mandates.

BINDING: Lay-flat binding along the 10-7/8” dimension. Must be with a flexible spine and free floating over structure. Adhesive on spine shall be a water-based, cold emulsion PUA which remains flexible for life of the binding. A reinforced crepe lining is to wrap over the spine. Apply cover by hot or cold glue process. Bleed trim all sides to a final size after binding of 8-3/8” x 10-7/8”. NOTE: No additional blank pages shall be allowed. Hinge score the covers to prevent cracking and run the cover paper grain parallel to the spine. The spine type shall remain centered.

SEPERATIONS:  None required. 

FORMAT: Text pages 1-98, plus a separate 4 page cover.

PRINTING: Print outside covers 1 and 4 in a solid bleeding all sides of PMS 298 Blue. Type matter reverses out as well as design elements in PMS 3393 plus several process illustrations butting the borders. Cover 2 prints a four color process illustration plus a 20% screened background which also crosses over onto cover 3. Text pages 7-22, 25, 37, 41, 43, 51, 65, 69 and 75-98 each print at least one four color process illustration. Text pages 14/15, 44/45, 46/47, 66/67 and 72/73 are cross-over aligned images as spot pantone colored illustrations and design elements plus process images.

All text pages print at least two spot Pantone colors plus Black ink.

NOTE: Traps and varnish/coating masks are entirely the contractor’s responsibility. Heavy ink coverage is required and the contractor must take any and all necessary precautions to prevent ghosting & lay a smooth uni¬form ink film. This product shall be manufactured on a lithographic print¬ing press capable of printing all the required colors with one pass through the press and the complete color bar as detailed on page 4 of these spec¬ifications. Do not assume “perfecting” is acceptable to the government. The inspector shall use the following criteria to determine acceptability. If the inspector is unable to determine by examination which side is first down, then press perfecting is acceptable. Web fed printing techniques shall be on dryer equipped presses only.

Ghosting & “in-line problems” shall not be acceptable.

COATING: Overall aqueous coat, satin finish, on outside covers pages 1 and 4 only. A “drytrapped” overall varnish may NOT be substituted.

DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the furnished materials is an integral part of specifications. No additional payment will be allowed due the contractor’s failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.

PRESS INSPECTION:  Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor’s printing facility for quality conformance. Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16” in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers. Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet. Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000° kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray-booth and functional densitometers. If the presses are equipped with automatic scanners you are NOT relieved of the requirement for the customer colorbar as detailed above.

PREAWARD SURVEY:  In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract.

PACKING: Plastic strap or shrink wrap in units of 10 copies only, paper banding shall not be allowed. Turn the items if necessary, to form a “neat” stack. Pack in new 44 pound edge crush test (or 275 bursting strength) corrugated containers filled to the top with 60 copies per carton. The cartons shall be specifically manufactured to fit this product.

<DESC>General:  A sources sought notice was issued under number N1000000035. That number is replaced by N2030100019.  Everything issued under N1000000035 is applicable under N2030100019. This is not a new solicitation. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services.
The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source, service procurement with Global Business Network (GBN) to acquire the below listed services.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements, per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1  (a) Authority, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 
A sources sought notice was posted in FedBizOpps on February 2, 2010 with responses for companies to submit capabilities documentation by February 10, 2010.  Four companies showed interest and three of them submitted the capabilities documents. The Project Manager and Contracting Officer's Representative reviewed the three documents and found none of the companies possessed experience and established techniques for climate change scenario planning and/or scenario creation that would allow them to transfer their techniques and effectively train NPS specialists in climate change scenario planning (a "train-the-trainer" approach). It would require vendors other than GBN to perform research activities, process development, analysis, toolkit development, and final products that could cost the government up to an additional $100K above the cost for this requirement.  GBN would not have to conduct these activities since they already did so under a USGS contract for the NPS in FY2009. As such, an additional cost up to $100K would be borne by the government if a vendor other than GBN would receive a contract.

<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel (Falcon Jet Corporation). Each aircraft is equipped with two Parker-Hannifin ABEX hydraulic pumps; Parker-Hannifin ABEX is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The hydraulic pump is a variable speed, variable delivery, pressure compensated pump which delivers hydraulic fluid under pressure to the various aircraft hydraulic subsystems in response to subsystem demand. The pump requires an overhaul every 3,000 flight (flt) hours. The HU25 fleet is tentatively scheduled to be retired in 2014 therefore the repair demand may decrease in the option years.</p>
<p><br />2.0 SCOPE</p>
<p>2.1. This Statement of Objectives (SOO) establishes the minimum requirements necessary to repair and overhaul hydraulic pumps P/N 40162.</p>
<p>2.2. Hydraulic pumps shall be repaired and/or overhauled IAW the OEM, Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 29-11-25 Revision 1 dated 15 Feb 2000 or later. Hydraulic pumps have a restoration (overhaul/high-time) interval, of 3000 flt. hrs. HU-25 hydraulic pumps are serial tracked, by Part Numbers (P/N) and Serial Numbers (S/N) under USCG ACMS. This tracking provides historical records of repairs/overhauls, item location, status, and an effective method of configuration control.</p>
<p>2.3. Repair/overhaul of the hydraulic pump, must be accomplished IAW the manufacturer's specifications. This SOO, it is not intended to be all inclusive, nor detract from the procedures outlined in the manufacturer's drawings, manuals, specifications, and service bulletins.</p>
<p>2.4. The contractor must have access to, or ability to obtain, current OEM Component Maintenance Manuals, Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and drawings as the USCG does not own, nor can it provide this data.</p>
<p>2.5. The contractor must identify, list, and provide the current status of all OEM Component Maintenance Manuals revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and other specifications applicable to the repair and overhaul of Coast Guard hydraulic pump P/N 40162.</p>
<p>2.6. The contractor must be responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested. This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, documentation, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul HU-25 hydraulic pumps.</p>
<p><br />3.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>3.1. The objectives of the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) HU-25 Division:</p>
<p>3.1.1. To obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center or equivalent to effectively test, troubleshoot, clean, repair/overhaul, and/or modify HU-25 hydraulic pumps to the most current configuration and have them returned to service for USCG operational use, in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition.</p>
<p>3.1.2. To have all HU-25 hydraulic pumps repaired/overhauled to meet OEM's specifications IAW the OEM's Component Maintenance Manuals, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and Specifications.</p>
<p>3.1.3. To track and document all work performed on HU-25 hydraulic pumps undergoing repair/overhaul as required under USCG ACMS. This is accomplished via a Component Repair Record (CRR) which is used by the USCG to update the Significant Component History Reports (SCHR) and to maintain the integrity of OEM restoration intervals and life cycle limits as applicable to the HU-25 hydraulic pump assemblies.</p>
<p>3.1.4. To obtain and observe at least two levels of repair/overhaul services for HU25 hydraulic pumps. The USCG anticipates at least two levels of service and contractors may propose additional levels, as such for separate incorporation of service bulletins, completion of modifications, the breakout of major components, etc. At a minimum, these two levels of service, "Repair," and "Overhaul," must be addressed :</p>
<p>3.1.4.1. "Repair" - "Return to Service" which is considered inspect, repair, and test as necessary. This work consists of inspection and analysis usually of specific defective conditions, repair of the conditions, replacement of defective parts only as necessary, and testing to meet the OEM's functional return to service requirements. A repair does not zero the "Time Since Overhaul" (TSO), component time continues for repaired items.</p>
<p>3.1.4.2. "Overhaul" - "High Time," having reached one of the OEM restoration intervals 3000 hrs., any life cycle limits, or having some other general condition (out-of-limit/out-of-tolerance) such as excessive wear, tear, damage, or corrosion, as deemed to require an overhaul level of service. An "Overhaul" is considered over and above the "Repair" scope; it includes the complete teardown, inspection, rework, assembly, and testing of components, to OEM original or rebuild specifications. An overhaul includes as required, the incorporation of applicable, service bulletins, modifications, configuration changes, and the replacement parts as necessary to satisfy OEM restoration interval and life cycle limited requirements. An overhaul zeroes the TSO and effectively restarts restoration intervals and OEM component life cycle limits as applicable.</p>
<p>3.1.5. Replace parts as follows:</p>
<p>3.1.5.1. Component parts found to be in serviceable condition IAW OEM specifications and functional testing shall be reused.</p>
<p>3.1.5.2. Missing parts, defective parts, high time, life, or cycle limited parts which cannot otherwise be repaired IAW OEM specifications, shall be scrapped and replaced with new OEM parts or other USCG serviceable parts, repaired IAW OEM specifications.</p>
<p>3.1.5.3. Replacement parts shall have full traceability to the OEM. <br /><br />3.2. To meet the Coast Guard's objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>3.2.1. Technical</p>
<p>3.2.1.1. Provide a detailed work specification clearly defining how the work will be accomplished for hydraulic pump repair/overhaul.</p>
<p>3.2.1.2. Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM's form, fit and function characteristics.</p>
<p>3.2.1.3. Have adequate facilities, tooling, fixtures, test equipment and experienced personnel to perform the work required.</p>
<p>3.2.1.4. Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard. Provide copies of the Quality Manual, and certifications (e.g. FAA, ISO 9000, OEM, etc.).</p>
<p>3.2.1.5. Provide warranty information.</p>

<p>3.2.1.6.3. Plan of inventory replacement parts to preclude delays.</p>
<p>3.2.1.6.4. Management plans for subcontractors participating on a major scale.</p>
<p>3.2.1.6.5. Corrective and preventative actions and procedures.</p>
<p>3.3. Past Performance</p>
<p>3.3.1. Provide documentation for having performed repair of similar or like items.</p>
<p>3.3.2. Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references' name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>3.4. Cost/Price Proposal</p>
<p>3.4.1. The offeror shall provide separate cost breakdowns for hydraulic pump repair and overhaul (labor and parts).</p>
<p>3.4.2. The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated using the following criteria:</p>
<p>3.4.2.1. Reasonableness: reasonableness will be established to the extent practicable by the existence of adequate competition, by comparison of all or a respective sample of proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or/price/cost from other contracts for similar work.</p>
<p>3.4.2.2. Realism: If it is determined that a realism assessment is needed, it may be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/sub-CLIN in the prospective offeror's quoted cost/price. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the quoted price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the technical submission.

<p>ADDENDUM<br />FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1)<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions To Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008) <br />SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.702(a)(1), the offeror shall submit a subcontracting plan along with any proposal which exceeds $500,000 and which has subcontracting possibilities. <br />If the proposal exceed $500,000 and the offeror believes there are no subcontracting possibilities, the offeror should include with the proposal a letter so stating, along with supporting rationale. The plan shall comply with the requirements of FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. In accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause, upon acceptance by the Contracting Officer, the plan will be incorporated into the resultant contract. NOTE: SUBCONTRACTING PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED FROM A SMALL BUSINESS OR FOREIGN FIRMS.<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999) Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance. The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.</p>
<p>o Factor 1 -Technical/Management Solution/Approach<br />o Factor 2 - Performance Measures and Metrics<br />o Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />o Factor 4 - Cost/Price<br />Factors 1, 2 and 3 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 4. While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical, past performance and performance factors approach equality.</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach<br />The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Offeror's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Hydraulic Pumps (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the offeror has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:<br />(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.<br />(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.<br />(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&#61607; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.</p>
<p>&#61607; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.</p>
<p>&#61607; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Offeror's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.<br />Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics<br />The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:<br />(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,</p>
<p>(b) Identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,</p>
<p>(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance<br />The past performance evaluation will examine how the Offeror's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.<br />The past performance evaluation will also examine the Offeror's actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.<br />Factor 4: Cost/Price<br />Each Offeror's cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:<br />(a) Evaluation or proposed price/cost. Offeror's quote shall include a firm-fixed-price for each of the one-year ordering periods contained in the 3-year base &amp; the 2-year option.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor's proposed cost/price proposal.</p>
<p>The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.<br />52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;<br />COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-10-AA06 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is a small business set-aside. The NAICS is 334516, business size is 500 employees. This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.
<p>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has need to lease with option to purchase an Automated Discrete Analyzer.</p>
<p>The following will detail the specific requirements.<br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The automated discrete analyzer will be used to automate and standardize various chemical tests we run on soil and plant materials. These assays currently require an enormous amount of technician time and throughput is impeded by the necessity to stop and regenerate enough glassware to continue our "macro" methods. The equipment will also allow miniaturization of the assays for nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate that will greatly reduce the amount of chemical waste produced from the methods currently used. Technician time devoted to those assays will also be greatly reduced, and reproducibility of results will also improve. In addition, the equipment eliminates the currently used Kjeldahl method which is hazardous.</p>
<p><strong>Technical specifications for an automated discrete analyzer:</strong> (1) detect ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and ortho-phospate in diverse soil and plant extract matrices. (2) quantify analytes with at least low ppm concentrations. (3) operate over a wide dynamic range (wide linear response). (4) automatically detect over-range samples, dilute, and re-run. (5) utilize microliter amounts of reagents (minimizing wastes). (6) utilize non-hazardous reagents where feasible. (7) generate auditable calibrations; generate reports in Excel, text, and common LIMS formats. (8) allow development of novel analyses. (9) user-friendly software for calibration, monitoring sample processing, and troubleshooting malfunctions. (10) minimize cost of consumables. (11) operate reliably with minimal intervention. (12) Maintenance Agreement. (13) Delivery, set-up and training.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:</strong><br />Base Year: April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011<br />Option Year 1: April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012<br />Option Year 2: April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013<br />Option Year 3: April 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014<br />Purchase price at the end of lease.<br /><br /><strong>Please price the base and option years as separate line items. The Government prefers to pay quarterly in arrears but monthly is acceptable, please specify in your proposal. Please include maintenance agreement in the price of the lease.</strong> Contractor shall furnish, deliver and set-up the Automated Discrete Analyzer to the USDA, ARS, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, 2413 East Business Highway 83, Weslaco, Texas 78596. Include literature sufficient to determine conformance of the instrument to meet or exceed the technical requirements.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-00-H-5006 0003. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

<DESC><p>PRE SOLICIATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research (DSR) Protective Technology Branch ( PTB), Morgantown, WV has a requirement for Side Impact Testing of Type I/III and Type II Ambulances.</p>
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>No government-wide notes apply. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a Federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for professional services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this requirement is 000HCCJC-2010-79310 and is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using FAR Subpart 13.1 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIOSH, Morgantown, WV intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirement, please either fill in the dollar amounts or provide a separate excel spreadsheet containing the same information:<br />CLIN 0001: Total Price:<br />Side Impact Testing $<br />Development of a detailed instrumentation and test plan to support the creation of four side impact crash test pulses. <br />The period of performance for this effort is delienated in the Statement of Work under reporting schedule.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK <br />for the <br />Side Impact Testing of Type I/III and Type II Ambulances</p>
<p>I. Background <br />The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (NTEA-AMD), is working to improve worker safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. One outcome of this collaborative effort has been the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones". <br />Together, NIOSH and the NTEA are continuing to investigate opportunities to improve the structural integrity of the patient compartment, seating systems, the patient gurney, and equipment location and mounting utilizing existing NIOSH data. To that end, NIOSH, the NTEA-AMD, and its members have already developed an SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice (draft in review) to characterize the response of an ambulance when subjected to a full frontal crash into a barrier at 30 mph. It should be noted that while this is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely excluded from this requirement. <br />This proposed SAE "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment" has been approved for balloting by SAE for further development and is now in its final revision. Likewise, the partners seek to develop a companion "SAE Recommended Practice" to characterize an ambulance's response in a side impact event. Unfortunately, the team has been unable to identify a dataset in the public domain suitable for use in the development of such a standard. Therefore, this contract is geared to develop such a dataset to support a well considered and defensible SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Side Impact testing (proposed).</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract <br />This contract will create the needed ambulance side impact dataset.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work <br />The Contractor will be responsible for the development of a detailed instrumentation and test plan to support the creation of four (4) side impact crash test pulses. Further, once approved, the Contractor will execute the test plan. The primary pieces of data derived from this testing, four pulses showing vehicle response over time, will be used by the NIOSH/NTEA-AMD team to develop a side impact test corridor suitable for inclusion in an as yet to be developed "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment."</p>
<p>Should additional funding be identified from sources such as seating, restraint, or gurney manufacturers, the contract may be expanded to include instrumented manikins in the patient compartment using existing or modified seating, restraint or gurney components.</p>
<p>Given the collaborative nature of this contract and the expectation costs will be shared by two or more partners, the Contractor will be expected to ensure all partners are aware of individual manufacturer requests - as funding indicates. As the Contracting Agency, NIOSH must be informed of any requests from partners for additional tasking that may affect costs. The Contractor will not be expected to proceed on any partner request without written approval from NIOSH. Likewise, NIOSH will not assume responsibility for any change in the contract's cost without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer. Thus, the Contractor will be expected to work very closely with the NIOSH Project Officer and his counterpart at the NTEA-AMD to ensure all tasking is approved prior to incurring costs.</p>
<p>IV. Technical Requirements <br />Description of Specific Tasks or Phases: <br />The Contractor shall prepare a detailed proposal with line item costs for each of the tasks described below: <br />1. The Contactor will take receipt of two ambulances (a Type II and a Type I or III) as provided by industry partners. Appropriate documentation will be completed to transfer ownership from each industry partner to the Contractor without charge to the industry partner or sales payment by Contractor. <br />2. All industry partner markings, inside and out, will be obscured by the Contractor. <br />3. The vehicles will be prepared for impact testing in accordance with industry practices, FMVSS, and EPA requirements to provide for the safe handling of the vehicle and any hazardous fluids or materials. Appropriate documentation will be prepared by the Contractor to ensure compliance. <br />4. The contractor will work with the ambulance providers (industry partners) to identify the fore/aft, lateral, and vertical cgs of the full vehicle including the patient compartment and the patient compartment separate from the vehicle's chassis. <br />5. The contractor will develop a test plan that mirrors the impact requirements delineated in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's Side Impact Crashworthiness Evaluation Crash Test Protocol (Version V), dated May 2008. <br />6. The contractor will instrument each of two test vehicles (as provided by NTEA-AMD partners) in accordance with the vehicle and patient compartment instrumentation described in the illustration below (this instrumentation configuration is pulled from SAE 2007-01-4267: Crash Testing of Ambulance Chassis Cab Vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please see attachment for pictures.</p>
<p><br />7. The Contractor will acquire 4 moving deformable barriers (MDB) as defined by the IIHS protocol. <br />8. The Contractor will conduct side impact crash testing twice on each vehicle: once on the curb side and once on the street side of each vehicle. <br />9. The strike location on the Type II shall be as follows: <br />a. Curb Side: Centered at combined chassis and patient compartment cg. <br />b. Street Side: Centered at the cg of the patient compartment only. However, if the positioning of the impact point at the cg of the patient compartment would allow the moving deformable barrier to impact the rear axle, the centerline of the impacting MDB shall be moved forward to allow the full MDB face to interact with the vehicle body forward of the axle.</p>
<p>10. The strike location on the Type I or III will be at the cg of the full vehicle (chassis and patient compartment as long as the centerline of the impacting MDB fully engages the patient compartment before impacting the cab of the vehicle. This impacting location will be used on both the curb and street side of the vehicle.</p>
<p>11. All measurements should be recorded and filtered according to the most recent version of SAE J211-1 and J211-2.</p>
<p>12. All instrumented data shall be provided in electronic spreadsheet format.</p>
<p>13. High speed video coverage of each test will be provided with a large enough field of view (perhaps both overhead and on the impacting side of the vehicle) to allow the full travel of impacted vehicle to be seen. Video data shall be provided in its original form and as reduced fidelity and slowed .mpg or .avi not to exceed 0.1 GB per video clip for use by the project team in a variety of presentation materials.</p>
<p>14. Once authorized to do so, the Contractor will complete all necessary documentation to dispose of each vehicle such that neither of these vehicles can reenter service.</p>
<p>V. <br />Reporting Schedule and End Products/Deliverables</p>
<p>This contract will have a two deliverables. Due Date Description of Deliverable and overall schedule <br />April 15, 2010 (Estimated dates) A draft test plan will be developed summarizing instrumentation location, calibration ranges, impact location, and all related and applicable SAE, FMVSS, AMD, or similar standards used to describe test criteria, instrumentation type, and instrument location. <br />April 31, 2010 (Estimated dates) All testing complete. <br />May 30, 2010 (Estimated dates) A summary test report which properly identifies all instrumentation locations, calibration limits, as well as, appropriate testing protocol and standards as needed to accurately describe and perhaps recreate testing. A full electronic data set on DVD(s) with all accelerometer data (filtered and</p>
<p>VI. Special Considerations</p>
<p>The Contractor must recognize funding for this project will be shared and thus provided to the Contractor by a variety of sources. In addition to NIOSH, the list of potential funding partners may include the NTEA-AMD, individual ambulance manufacturers, seat manufacturers, restraint manufacturers, and gurney manufacturers. While NIOSH will write the broad contract to cover the dynamic testing of two ambulances, individual partners may, with mutual consent, ask for and be granted the opportunity to "piggy-back" testing of their components (seats, gurneys, etc.), as installed in the interior of each ambulance, during full-scale testing of each ambulance. NIOSH will assist in the negotiation of a fair and equitable contribution for each partner depending upon their level of participation. However, NIOSH will not assume responsibility for the payment of any jointly negotiated payment beyond that expressly identified by NIOSH as representing its share of the test program. <br />The NTEA-AMD, through the generous donations of its members or other entities, will provide the test articles (2 ambulances). At no point will NIOSH nor the NTEA-AMD be listed as the title holder of record for either vehicle during the contracted test period. Rather, it is expected that the Contractor (test facility) will take possession of each test article from the donating organization. Once testing is complete and all test results documented, the Contractor will be responsible for the proper disposal of all test articles, including vehicles. <br />Your quote shall include the following:<br />&bull; Total proposed price <br />&bull; Capability Statements in accordance with the Statement of Work<br />&bull; Evaluation Criteria<br />Evaluation Criteria: <br />1. The degree to which the test facility has a quality assurance program that adequately ensures test equipment calibration, maintenance and record keeping is in order and fulfills the government's requirements.<br /><br />The test facility shall provide a copy of their quality assurance program and calibration records for those pieces of equipment proposed for this testing.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation is amended:
<p dir="ltr">1. Offers due date is extended to Friday March 12, 2010, 12 Noon Pacific time, by email to thuy.ta@gsa.gov.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Another site visit is scheduled for Tuesday March 9, 2010, at 10:00 AM Pacific time. Please meet in the lobby at 9:50AM PST, a GSA representative will escort the site visit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Please submit job references by Tuesday March 9, 2010, 12 Noon Pacific time, by email to thuy.ta@gsa.gov. Any already submitted do not need to be resubmitted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. CLIN 9 (parking lot induction lighting) and CLIN 11 (photovoltaic system) are optional line items - if an offeror does not want to propose to do these the offeror may simply line out that line item(s) on the Contract Price Form. An offeror who only wants to bid for one or both of these, and not for the mechanical work, may do so. These line items will be evaluated separately and awarded separately (if reasonably priced offers are received for them and the budget is sufficient; otherwise they may not be awarded). If an offeror wants to bid for only the PV or induction lighting and not the mechanical work, 5 job references must be submitted for comparable work in the last 3 years (i.e., work involving similar exterior lighting or photovoltaic installations), with correct client contact information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. A design addendum is added revising the warranty requirement for the parking lot induction lighting (CLIN 9) to 5 years including both labor and materials, with 24 hour response time. Previously this was for materials only.</p>
<p dir="ltr">6. Questions and answers are posted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">7. A revision to the specifications has been posted. This significantly streamlines the commissioning requirements, and itemizes exactly what equipment requires functional performance testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">-SECTION 01 91 00 - COMMISSIONING has been replaced in its entirety</p>
<p dir="ltr">-SECTION 25 08 00 - COMMISSIONING OF INTEGRATED AUTOMATION has been deleted in its entirety</p>
<p dir="ltr">- General modifications applicable to all specification sections:</p>
<p dir="ltr">All prior references to Section 25 08 00 are replaced with references to Section 01 91 00</p>

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION EXTENDS THE SUSPENSE DATE FOR THE SOC SUBMISSION TO FRIDAY, 11 JANUARY 2008
The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.  

The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Friday, 11 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Mr Herbert B. Countee, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and can be submitted to herb.countee@losangeles.af.mil. Inquiries may be directed to Mr. Countee at 310-653-9525.

<DESC><p>**This notice revision is a follow-on request for Statements of Capability to the original posting in December 2007. Please read below for further guidance.**</p>
<p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire sustainment for the current EPOCH based (http://www.integ.com/Products.html) Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) and to extend the system to support new satellites and architecture upgrades. The CCS-C Block II contract will provide Air Force Space Command telemetry, tracking and commanding functionality in support of current and future MILSATCOM satellite operations for the period FY12 - FY22. During this period, the CCS-C Block II system must comply with evolving Information Assurance requirements and spacecraft and operator needs. CCS-C Block II training products will be developed in compliance with the AFSPC Standard Space Trainer architecture. CCS-C Block II capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interoperability with dedicated ground and payload control systems. Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include: launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations. Future migration to Unified S-Band (USB) waveforms and data formats shall be supported. Contractor must be able to sustain current CCS-C hardware, software, databases, command procedures and Technical Orders. System upgrades to address Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated. Contractor must demonstrate a transparent process/capability that develops, tests, installs and transitions new software and hardware to operations with near-zero system regressions. The contractor will demonstrate a robust system deficiency (problem resolution) capability resulting in negligible CCS-C Block II deficiency backlog and expeditious operator system complaint resolution. The contractor will report performance using the earned value management system and have approved business systems, including cost reporting, purchasing, and accounting systems.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in July 2012 lasting through FY22. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 6721 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, MD 21046. The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2011. On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA. A minimum Department of Defense (DoD) security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) demonstrating expertise and capability in satellite command and control hardware and software design and test procedures by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday, 23 March 2010. The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan. The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates. Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also is available upon request from the contracting officer, Capt Peterson. If your company previously submitted a SOC in response to the original posting and the SOC is adequate, no further submission is required. However, please communicate with the contact listed below to express continued interest in this potential acquisition.</p>
<p>The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length. This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission. Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format. All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other than the incumbent exists. Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Capt Andrew Peterson, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.

<DESC>Contractor Questions and Government Responses<BR>Army Registry Transcript System (AARTS)<BR>U.S. Army Human Resource Command (HRC)<BR><BR>Request for Proposal (RFP):  W91WAW-10-R-0074 in lieu of W91WAW-10-R-0016<BR><BR>(NOTE:  A new solicitation number was issued for this requirement, due to an error in the Army Single Face Industry System and the Federal Business Opportunities Website.)<BR><BR>Contractor Question 1:<BR><BR>Section 1.3 of the Revised PWS (Scope and Objectives) contains the following point:  Facilitate electronic transmission to and acceptance by the academic community at large.  Can the government confirm that this electronic transmission refers to transmission of the Guide as defined under Section 2.1 (Definitions) which then correlates to the requirement under section 5.1.1 to provide to HRC PDE, on a weekly basis, electronic updates of the contractors Guide in eXtensible Markup Language (XML)&.  If not, please clarify (i.e., does this refer to the AARTS transcripts and their transmission to academic institutions on behalf of students).  Can the government clarify what is meant by &acceptance by the academic community at large.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 1:  No, Section 1.3 does not refer to the on-line ACE Guide defined in Section 2.1.  Section 5.1.1 refers to the electronic updates of ACE credit recommendations to the Department of the Army Human Resources Command (DA HRC) who further uploads the data to the AARTS Program and does not refer to the on-line ACE Guide that is open to the public.  <BR><BR>Contractor Question 2:  <BR><BR>Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services?  If so, who?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 2:  Yes, the American Council on Education (ACE).<BR><BR>Contractor Question 3:<BR><BR>The description of evaluation factor 1 is limited to Acceptable and Unacceptable adjectival ratings only.  As it currently stands, the highest rating of Acceptable reflects A proposal that satisfies all of the Governments requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.  (emphasis added)  It appears that other higher ratings such as Outstanding, Good, etc. may have been inadvertently excluded.  Please clarify.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 3:  The Government will use Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Procedures.  Therefore, Acceptable or Unacceptable are the only adjectival ratings used for Evaluation Factor 1.  <BR><BR>Contractor Question 4:<BR><BR>Who is the current incumbent contractor?  We were under the impression that it was the American Council on Education, so we asked them directly if they were currently responsible for any of the aspects of the revised PWS.  We were told, There remain deliverables in the amended PWS that are currently executed by ACE through the current contract.  For specifics, I direct you to the COR (Robert Drake) who listed in the solicitation.  He is the COR for the current AARTS contract.  Paragraph 1.5 states, If incumbent is selected for the award, no transitional costs will be reimbursed and the phase-in period will not be exercised.  Requirement can be increased, decreased or terminated with 30 days notice given to the contractor.  Is ACE the only current incumbent contractor or is there another organization currently providing staffing to the AARTS Operation Center at Ft. Leavenworth?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 4:  The ACE is the only current incumbent contractor.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 5:<BR><BR>Is it the contractors responsibility to validate ATRRS with course data received from the ACE Military Guide?  In other words, does the contractor who will receive this award responsible for assigning ACE exhibits to the respective training and occupations associated with each soldier to formulate the body of AARTS transcripts for individual soldiers?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 5:  No, the contractor provides the credit recommendations.  The AARTS Program integrates the credit recommendations with the Soldier data.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 6:<BR><BR>Given the fact that questions are due in on 2/4/10 and our proposal depends on some of these answers for logistics, scope, pricing, and other critical aspects of the proposal; is there an extension beyond 2/9/10 available to allow for proper incorporation of the responses from the Government?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 6:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) closing date has been extended to 11 March 2010 (4:00 PM E.S.T.).<BR><BR>Contractor Question 7:<BR><BR>Is this still a set-aside RFP for small-business?  As we mentioned in the previous question, ACE appears to be the incumbent contractor, however, they do not qualify as a small business under the parameters described in the RFP.  As the authority for college credit recommendations for more than six decades who has been the recipient of sole source selection until now, why would the Army elect to release an RFP that presents tasking ACE, as the nations leading experts in the field, have provided for so long with small business set-aside restrictions that prevent them from directly bidding on the tasking they have been doing?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 7:  This Request for Proposal (RFP) is set-aside for small businesses.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 8:  <BR><BR>With a release of the solicitation 22 JAN 10 after 9:00 P.M. have you considered an extension for contractors to prepare for such an important submission.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 8:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) closing date has been extended to 11 March 2010 (4:00 PM E.S.T.).<BR><BR>Contractor Question 9:  <BR><BR>Section 1.2 of the Revised PWS contains the following incomplete sentence:  AARTS operations will relocate to Ft. Knox, KY no later than.  Can the government specify this no later than date.  In this regard, will the AARTS database continue to be hosted by EREC in Indianapolis, or will the database be moved to and hosted out of Ft. Knox?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 9:  Yes, the AARTS Operation Center will relocate to Fort Knox, Kentucky NLT 30 September 2010.  The EREC will continue to host the AARTS database.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 10:<BR><BR>Who is the incumbent for this effort? <BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 10:  ACE is the incumbent for this effort.  <BR><BR>Contractor Question 11:<BR><BR>What software is being used and what is the language it is written in to produce the AARTS transcripts?  In other words, what database is currently used to store the AARTS data?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 11:  The database being used to store the AARTS data is MS SQL 2005.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 12:<BR><BR>Section 1.3 of the Revised PWS (Scope and Objectives) contains the following point:  Provide technical support for the AARTS.  Move AARTS totally into a paperless environment.  Can the government explain this paperless environment requirement further?  Is the government envisioning a paperless environment wherein AARTS transcripts are:  a) requested, b) generated, and c) distributed electronically to students, their counselor(s), and academic institutions as the need arises (via a central website)? In addition, is it expected that this be done both on the individual level (i.e., one transcript at a time) or batches (i.e., multiple transcripts in groupings)?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 12:  Some schools have already indicated that they prefer to receive mailed hard copies of the official AARTS transcripts only.  In Section 1.3, the contractor is asked to assist whenever possible in convincing schools that electronic transcripts are beneficial to all involved.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 13:<BR><BR>Having worked with integrating data with ATRRS and RITM, can you tell us if your systems reach out to these systems currently?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 13:  Yes, the AARTS receives data uploads from ATRRS.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 14:<BR><BR>In the PWS, it is mentioned that the current contractor is ACE.  I was wondering if you might be able to provide me with the contract # for this particular contract.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 14:  The current contract number is W74V8H-05-P-0019.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 15:<BR>The Pre-Solicitation Opportunity Summary Report indicates Place of Performance Contractors Site, US. The Draft PWS (Para 1.4) identifies Work Location: Work shall be performed at the Government Site. and Part 4 of the Draft PWS suggests the Place of Performance will be determined upon award of the contract. Responses to the questions Dated 16 Dec indicate that the place of performance will be the contractors site yet the newly released Solicitation indicates the Place of performance will be government site. Since offered price is heavily dependent upon Place of Performance, please validate where the Government desires the work to be performed.<BR>Answer to Contractor Question 15:  The work will be performed at the contractors site as well as the appropriate Government locations for course evaluations.<BR>Contractor Question 16:<BR>The RFP projects 200 to 250 courses will be evaluated per year.  Some courses may only last 5 days or less, while others may span up to 50 weeks or more.  What is the average length of time of the 200 to 250 courses that would need to be assessed for college credit recommendations per year?  The length of the courses will directly impact the amount of time needed to assess the instruction.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 16:  The American Council on Education (ACE) evaluates over 300 course evaluations per year with an average prep and on-site evaluation time of approximately 45-63 days.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 17:<BR><BR>Are there additional Government personnel on the effort other than Dr. Drake in the current location and if so how many.  If there are, will the Government re-staff those positions once at Ft. Knox or will the contractor team has to support those prior roles?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 17:  Yes, there are currently 5 full-time Department of the Army Civilian (DAC) employees besides Dr. Drake.   Only four of these positions will be re-staffed at Fort Knox.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 18:<BR><BR>In paragraph 5.1.1, it states, Deliver to the HRC PDE, on a weekly basis, electronic updates of the contractors Guide in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format whenever the Military Guide-On-Line is updated.   The Military Guide-On-Line appears to be referring to the online version of the American Council on Educations Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces (ACE Guide).  Does the contractors Guide referred to in the above statement infer that there is a separate Guide written in XML that is maintained by the contractor that incorporates information presented in the ACE Guide?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 18:  The ACE document is proprietary to ACE.  The ACE guide is a reference document.  <BR><BR>Contractor Question 19:<BR><BR>Section 5.2.4 of the Revised PWS states:  Collect information from the colleges and universities to which AARTS transcripts are sent based on lists of colleges and universities provided by the AARTS Operations Center Manager.  What information is expected?  Is it the percentage of credit recommendations on individual transcripts that are accepted by colleges and universities?  Or is it broader surveys to elicit information on the value of and acceptability of credit recommendations (along the lines of what is described in Section 5.3.3:  Conduct continuing and periodic surveys to determine use of AARTS transcript to award college credit.  <BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 19:  The PWS tells you what your requirements are.  Contractors can obtain this answer from the PWS.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 20:<BR><BR>Paragraph 5.2 of the PWS, it states that it is the contractors responsibility to ensure 100% accuracy in the AARTS transcript being properly titled and have an Official Seal.  As with our previous question, does this mean that the staff provided by this contract is responsible for the creation of AARTS transcripts for individual soldiers and are therefore responsible for course-to-exhibit and occupation-to-exhibit articulation and presentation on the documents?  Would not the official seal remain as that of the American Council on Education, as they are the ones who evaluate military training and experiences and recommend the college credit?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 20:  a. No, the AARTS Operations Center staff create and distribute the completed Official AARTS transcripts. <BR><BR>Contractor Question 21:<BR><BR>When does the AARTS Operations expect to relocate to Fort Knox?  The RFP states no later than, but  (1.2)?  Is it permissible to include relocation costs in the proposal for staff that must move from Kansas to Kentucky?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 21:  Yes, the AARTS Operation Center will relocate to Fort Knox, Kentucky NLT 30 September 2010.  No it is not permissible to include relocation costs in the proposal for staff that must move from Kansas to Kentucky.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 22:<BR><BR>What is the level of effort for this SOW?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 22:  The level of effort for this Statement of Work is 100% performance.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 23:<BR> <BR>Part 5, Specific Tasks: What staff members currently perform the duties of the contractor's Data Summit Team?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 23:  The contractor determines this when establishing their Data Summit Team.<BR> <BR>Contractor Question 24:<BR><BR>Is there an incumbent for this requirement?  If so, would you be able to provide me with the contract number?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 24:  ACE is the incumbent contractor for this requirement.  The current contract number is as follows:  W74V8H-05-P-0019.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 25:<BR><BR>Section 5.2.1 of the revised PWS states:  Provide third party assurance of the transcript data and grant permission to the Army Human Resources Command, the Adjutant General Directorate, Education Division to use the accrediting agency as part of the transcript title.  Please provide the definition of third party and accrediting agency in this sentence.  Are they one and the same (i.e., the entity whose Official Seal is provided on the transcripts)?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 25:  Yes, in Section 5.2.1, Third party and accrediting agency are one in the same and the one whos seal is provided on the transcripts.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 26:<BR><BR>What type of technical support is currently provided for the AARTS by the incumbent?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 26:  ACE does not provide any technical support.  <BR><BR>Contractor Question 27:<BR><BR>Are any of the systems that currently provide information using the XML-based format?  If so, which ones?  If not, which ones?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 27:  The American Council on Education (ACE) provides the DA HRC technical person with access to the ACE secure web site.  This will give the technical person capabilities to pull up the specific XML file containing the ACE credit recommendations.  There is no specific application involved.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 28:<BR><BR>Who is the incumbent contractor?  How long?  What is the annual contracted amount for the current contract.  What is the level of effort for this SOW?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 28:  ACE is the incumbent contractor.  The level of effort for this SOW is 100% performance.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 29:<BR><BR>Can the government provide a technical description of the AARTS database (i.e., database type, structure and contents) referred to in Section 5.3.11 of the Revised PWS.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 29:  A technical description of the AARTS database will be provided at the time of the award of the contract.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 30:<BR><BR>Will the AARTS transcript still display the ACE seal on them?  After all, even if another contractor is selected under this RFP to provide support described in this PWS, it is still ACE that has reviewed the professional training and educational experiences of the soldier and provides the college credit recommendations.  To display a different logo on the AARTS transcript might mislead the higher education community and deter some colleges and universities from accepting the credit.<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 30:  The American Council on Education (ACE) has set the industry standard for college credit recommendations.  Displaying the ACE seal is at the Contractors discretion.  However, the Government requires the transcript to have an industrial standard equal or comparable to ACEs standard.  <BR><BR>Contractor Question 31:<BR><BR>In paragraph 1.6.1 (Quality Control) or the PWS, defective services are mentioned?  Could you elaborate on past problems that the Army has experienced that were considered defective services, so we will have an understanding as to what would be considered as such?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 31:  No, the Army has not experienced any defects from the ACE data uploads.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 32:<BR><BR>Based on the transition provided, is there an existing Phased Strategy for what is moved between contract award and 30 SEPT 2010?

This includes the majority that go out electronically and the hard copy official copies that are printed and mailed to schools by the AARTS staff.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 35:<BR><BR>Please expand on 5.3.11 (Managing the AARTS database) of the PWS as to what type of functions will this entail?  Does this mean that the contractor will be responsible for providing an onsite IT person(s)?  If so, how many employees currently perform this function? Is the management of the AARTS database the sole responsibility of the contractor?<BR><BR>Answer to Contractor Question 35:  The Contractor is not is not responsible for providing an onsite IT person.<BR><BR>Contractor Question 36:<BR>The American Council on Education has had this as a sole-source contract through DANTES for several decades.

<DESC>Questions and Answers Regarding Item Four of the RFI notes:
Item Four of the RFI: Increasing capacity/peak performance (greater than 75 amp/hours,20amp/500 watt peak, 100 watt nominal); 	Questions:Where is the desired operating voltage designated? What are the actual energy density requirements? Is there a preferred operating voltage? Is it desirable to maximize the energy density (energy storage capability) irrespective of the operating voltage?
Answer:No desired/preferred operating voltage is designated. The topic is not bounded,as the actual requirements will be dictated by the design requirements and payload of the platform.  The intent of the RFI is to gather information on possible alternative sources that could be pursued to address the current, limiting sources of power.

<p>D.  Page 12, section 1.2.3 TRITON Requirements and Page 35, section 7.3, GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION, System Level Model for TRITON:  Revisions have been made to the uplink modeling equations and the corresponding MATLAB code.  Revised System Level Model will be emailed to all attendees of TRITON Proposer's Day and contractors that have requested the Program Documentation.   Please use the revised version of the uplink model when preparing your proposals.</p>
<p>E.   The following solicitation questions and answers are provided:</p>
<p>Q50.  	BAA paragraph 4.4 states that "Maximum page lengths for each section are shown in braces { } below."  Paragraph 4.4.1 specifies a maximum page count of 2, 15 and 100 for Sections I, II and III, respectively.  Would DARPA allow the offeror to make minor page count adjustments for each subparagraph within a subsection (i.e. A, B, C, etc.) so long as the total pages per Section remain as specified?</p>
<p>A50.  	No.  please follow the page limits specified in the BAA.</p>
<p>Q51.  	The location of the submarine uplink transmitter may drive the schedule and costs for TRITON.  In developing the $39M NTE cost figure, did the Government develop a notional concept that identified possible locations for the uplink transmitter and can those locations be shared with industry?</p>
<p>A51.  The Government did identify feasible locations on the submarine for the uplink laser transmitter.  The $39M NTE did not assume a particular location for the uplink transmitter.  In the Proposers' Day TEMPALT briefing given by Mr. Ray Potts, the Government identified the following seven possible locations for the uplink transmitter:<br />1)	 The vertical launch tube with an optical window on the tube cover; <br />2)	Within the sonar pressure sphere in the bow (requires removing and replacing an acoustic transducer with a light pipe); Concept drawing in TRITON brief given by Dr. Larry Stotts<br />3)	 Using a dry deck shelter; <br />4)	Within the pressure hull through an optical hull window;<br />5)	Pressure tolerant appendages located external to the hull;<br />6)	Pressure tolerant appendages located in the sail bay; and<br />7)	Pressure tolerant appendages located in the free flood area.</p>
<p>The Government did examine the forward sonar sphere location and determined it was feasible to replace an acoustic transducer with an optical window/light pipe that would be installed between the sphere and the submarine's plastic nose cone.  The Government also examined modifying the missile tube hatch with an optical window.</p>
<p>The Government will entertain other transmitter locations.</p>
<p>Q52.  Will DARPA accept the following cost reduction alternative solutions that are contrary to the BAA requirements as delineated at Industry Day:<br />a.	A minimal combination of transmitters and receivers that will demonstrate connectivity at low data rates and reduced depths which can then be used with models to show scalability to the fully operational capability described in the BAA?<br />A52a.  No.</p>
<p>b.	Consider the use of alternate airborne or undersea platforms?  The major cost of meeting BAA requirements is the submarine SHIPALT.  Potential undersea alternative candidates include the use of commercially available submersibles or possibly using a fixed underwater test fixture (using analytic methods to incorporate the effects of platform motion). Potential airborne solutions to consider include the use of aerostats or possibly a fixed land based site similar to what was used on the ORCA project.<br />A52b.  No.</p>

<DESC>NASA has decided to postpone the release of the NASA Enterprise Data Center RFP.With leadership changes and new OMB requirements regarding Cloud Computing, Greening IT,Virtualization, and Federal Data Center consolidation guidance, NASA reexamined the NEDCacquisition strategy and concluded it did not fully address future NASA enterpriserequirements.	Based on commercial best practices and other Federal data centerconsolidation lessons learned, NASA intends to create a data center consolidation plan toincorporate all data centers, systems and applications.  This data center plan willinclude a data center architecture and full enterprise assessment, which will allow NASAto design an infrastructure strategy to address all business requirements while takingadvantage of opportunities to reduce energy costs and utilize innovations like cloudcomputing.  This plan will allow for optimal NASA data center consolidation and makeappropriate decisions about utilization of data center facilities, modernizing existingNASA facilities or outsourcing.  The NASA data center strategy and consolidation planwill significantly change and is expected to be completed later this fall. Interestedparties are encouraged to begin monitoring the NASA Acquisition Internet Site(http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/nais/link_syp.cgi ) and FEDBIZOPPS(https://www.fbo.gov/) in the fall of this year for future NASA data center businessopportunities.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No costs will be paid for any costs incurred or assumed in response to this pre-solicitation notice. 
This is a synopsis of a proposed contract action as required by FAR 5.2.

Proof of this will be required at the time of proposal submission.

<DESC>A firm fixed-price (FFP) contract has been awarded to Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia located at 1001 N. Emmet Street, Charlottesville, VA 22903 in response to solicitation number W912HZ-09-BAA03, Topic 4-1, Energy Security Assessments and Islanding Methodologies.  The objective of this work is to develop a methodology within web-based software to implement principles of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and risk analysis. The approach will enable decision makers to address a broad and varying range of emergent conditions in the energy environment including mission criticality, regulatory and market forces, disruption of service, grid failure, infrastructure deterioration, and so forth. Coupled with a set of performance criteria, MCDA can complement and improve on a single economics-based metric for energy security, or on multiple and integrated metrics, as the user requires. The MCDA framework will provide the relevant opportunity, cost, and risk tradeoffs to compare current energy security strategies and technologies to potential investments in energy security while quantifying the impact to missions in their implementation. The approach will support the analysis of off-grid energy generation and distribution networks including electricity, natural gas, steam, liquid fuel, water, and others for the diverse missions that the installations execute or support.  The period of performance will be eighteen (18) months commencing on 4 March 2010.

<p>See attached Justification and Approval for description of services.</p>
<p>It has been determined that Chainbridge Technologies is the only readily available, responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE [RFQ] IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response which, if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.

<p>***NOTE***</p>
<p>"Prohibition of Obligating or Awarding Federal Funds to ACORN"</p>
<p>Congress has prohibited the use of federal funds to award contracts to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or allied organizations and therefore in order to be eligible for award under this solicitation, all offerors must affirmatively indicate by the time of award that they are not subject to this prohibition.

<AWDNBR>W91YU0-10-P-0242
<ARCHDATE>04042010
<DESC>Western Regional Contracting Office intends to award a contract under FAR Part 6.302-1 for the following:    This requirement is for the purchase of Electric Pen Drive systems for the Madigan Army Medical Center Dental Clinics.    
Purchasing of these systems will allow for the most updated technological equipment to be utilized by staff and interns.  These requested items have previously been purchased for the MAMC Dental Clinics in FY09.  This purchase will ensure continuity and standardization of clinical instruments used by the dentists.
Synthes is the producer of this product that is electric driven versus air and/or nitrogen.  The result is improved patient care and decreased cost to the Government.  Dentists make medical treatment determination of the patient based on product suitability, patient-to-product compatibility, and training in the dental procedures relating to each manufacturer?s products so as to insure the well being of each patient.  It is essential to the health and welfare of the patient, that the treating dentists utilize standardized equipment in which they have experience and extreme confidence.  
Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Madigan Army Medical Center Dental Clinics are standardizing Dental equipment at all MAMC Dental clinics. Synthes systems are currently installed at the clinics.  This requested purchase will complete the standardization and compatibility.
Synthes is the only authorized source for this equipment at this time.   It would be cost prohibitive to replace all of the existing units with new systems from a different manufacturer that are not compatible with the Synthes systems that are already in place.   Additionally, Synthes is the only source of authorized replacement parts for those units already in place.   
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
