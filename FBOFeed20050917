<DESC>It is the intent of the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System, (JPATS) to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Bohlke International Airways, St Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands for a firm-fixed-price contract for commercial maintenance and logistics support of a Government owned Beech 99 aircraft. This aircraft will be stationed in St. Croix, U.S.  Virgin Islands. The intended base period of performance for the resulting contract should be October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005 with three one month options.  The Beech 99 aircraft is used to perform JPATS missions of transporting prisoners for its customers, U.S. Marshal Service (USMS) and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE). The JPATS requirement is for maintenance support for the aircraft including daily line maintenance and servicing, scheduled and unscheduled minor maintenance, and operational checks during the period of performance.  The effort requires that the maintenance provider supply properly certificated/licensed mechanics to perform the maintenance.

Materials and parts for correction of discrepancies identified during scheduled maintenance events shall be supplied on a cost reimbursable basis. The services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2. The total dollar amount will not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Capability statements must be received by quotation due date to be considered. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals in writing or via fax at 405-680-3496. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 7 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1003329 & 1007541, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Mead Walker Consulting under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to Mead Walker Consulting, 1199 Hope Well Rd, Downingtown, PA 19335-1206.  There is only one responsible source and  no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons: The FDA has worked with Mead Walker for approximately two years to develop the HL7 Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Message.  Mead has extensive experience with HL7, and is one of two experienced modelers in HL7 that has direct, relevant experience with developing messages for the HL7 Public Health Reporting Domain.  Mead has worked extensively over the past 2 years with FDA and CDC, specifically in the area of public health surveillance.  Mead is uniquely qualified, in that he already has thorough knowledge and experience with developing a message that supports FDA regulatory and surveillance program requirements for CDER/CBER’s Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), CDRH’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), and FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).  Mead understands FDA’s business processes and analysis requirements for adverse event data reported to the agency, and well as other regulatory requirements, such as stability data industry submissions that support new drug applications or biologics license applications.  Mead produces excellent work products, as has successfully coordinated the ballot and approval of two public health standards:  Disease surveillance (Case Notification) and Adverse events (ICSR).  Both standards are ANSI approved.  Mead’s ability to translate FDA requirements into HL7 modeling language is exceptional, and has contributed to the overall success of our work.  The learning curve for a new contractor to understand HL7 modeling, the ICSR message standard, the International Conference on Harmonisation’s E2B message specification, and FDA business processes is substantial.  The FDA Data Standards Council (DSC) would like to minimize the amount of ballot fatigue and resource commitment necessary to orient and train a new contractor.  The DSC AE Workgroup will also be engaged in extensive planning and system development to implement the existing ICSR message and create an FDA implementation guide.  This concurrent work will greatly reduce the amount of time and assistance that can be devoted to bringing a new contractor up to speed on the standard and our goal to consolidate AE reporting formats within the agency.  Mead’s work with FDA has already provided him with an opportunity to have some preliminary discussions with CVM about specific requirements for accommodating their products, and Mead previously received CFSAN database tables for preliminary review over a year ago.  Mead’s understanding of how AERS, VAERS, and MAUDE accepts, processes and archives data will contribute greatly to his efforts to migrate CFSAN data into the existing model structure, and given his extensive work with both FDA and CDC, the DSC is confident that Mead will do an outstanding job, and is better positioned to work more independently to develop the necessary requirements analysis documents, and HL7 project descriptions and ballot materials.  Mead has worked with HL7’s Information Exchange for the last four years, he has been intensely involved with Version 3 implementation projects at CDC and the FDA.  Mead Walker has also worked with Oracle in the creation of their V3 implementation guides.  Mr. Walker’s work has also included creating draft Vital Statistics messages for the National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS), Version 2 implementation guides for laboratory results reporting (CDC BioTerrorism) and immunization registries (National Center for Infectious Disease (NCID)).  While working at Shared Medical Systems, Mead Walker was involved with coordinating that vendor’s use of HL7 messages, and actively worked in documenting the use of X12 standards to support Patient Eligibility Inquiries and Reports.  Creating useful written documents has been a critical aspect of Mr. Walker’s work in healthcare data processing since 1984.   Mead Walker has developed functional design documents and participated in documentation of a corporate data model at Shared Medical Systems (now Siemens), has acted as the editor of the Message Development Framework for HL7 Version 3, and developed V3 Implementation Guides for CDC and Oracle.  These reasons, considered in their entirety, why FDA anticipates a sole source award to Mead Walker Consulting, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 541690 –Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the small business size standard is $6M. The following are objectives and tasks Mead Walker Consulting will be requested to provide:  Objectives:  To develop a standardized, structured electronic message and ballot documentation for representing complex Individual Case Safety Reports and protocol information to be balloted at Health Level 7.  To reconcile the messages with the HL7 RCRIM Domain Analysis Model (DAM) (S.2).  Task:  1.  Extend ICSR to support food and animal drug related reporting.  2. ICSR Implementation Guide Development. 3. Extend RCRIM Domain Analysis Model. 4.Provide education on HL7 and messaging standards to FDA.  Task 1:  Activity:  Review requirements for data, create mapping between data requirements and ICSR, prepare proposal for ICSR updates (if needed), and work within HL7 to get updates through the balloting process.  There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates.  Task 2:  ICSR Implementation Guide Development, which includes: 1. Define which model contents are to be supported.  This includes classes, associations and attributes. 2. Determine strategy for object identifiers (OIDs). 3. Identify vocabularies to be included.  Create proposals as needed for HL7 domains and value sets, and LOINC codes. 4, Create draft Implementation Guide document, drawing on, where possible, existing HL7 and CDC guides. 5. Carry out internal document review and update document. 6. Submit Implementation Guide to HL7.  Task 3:  Extend RCRIM Domain Analysis Model (DAM) (S.2).  The following effort will be required for the items discussed above.  Note, work on this task is predicated upon the promised publication of the RCRIM Domain Analysis Model, which includes:  1.  Review and understand published DAM. 2. Assess and propose approach to DAM development. 3. Provide class level mapping to the ICSR. 4. Document proposal for DAM extension. 5. Work with RCRIM to have model extensions enabled.  Task 4:  Provide Education on HL7 and Messaging Standards to FDA, which includes providing educational sessions for FDA staff where requested. There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates.  Period of performance is one year from date of award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1003902, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a competitive purchase order for commercial services under the simplified acquisition procedures. The project title is:  Microbiological Contaminants in Animal Feed.  The scope of work is as follows: Consultant Support Services for Microbiological Contaminants in Animal Feed.  Introduction: The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is seeking to obtain consultant services for identifying, reviewing and summarizing published scientific literature on microbiological contamination of animal feeds and on the characteristics of disease outbreaks and disease processes associated with contaminating microbes.  CVM’s Animal Feed Safety System (AFSS) Work Group will use this information to rank the risks that microbes present in feeds pose to human and animal health as part of a comprehensive risk ranking exercise for animal feed contaminants. Background: The Animal Feed Safety System (AFSS) is the FDA’s new comprehensive, preventive, risk-based regulatory program for animal feeds that is aimed at protecting human and animal health. A key aspect of this program is the development of a relative risk ranking model for the hazardous chemical, microbiological and physical contaminants in animal feed ingredients and complete feeds that pose risks to animal and/or human health.  Identifying the contaminants that pose the most significant risks will allow the agency to focus its regulatory resources on reducing or eliminating those risks, and will help the industry understand how to identify and minimize inadvertent risks associated with animal feed before they result in decreased production, adverse health consequences to the animal, and potential risks to human health. Description of Work: The contractor will identify, analyze and summarize information and data in the published scientific literature, and from consultations with other experts, on the types and amounts of microbiological contamination that have been reported in animal feed ingredients and mixed feed, and will gather the information about identified microbes in feed that will permit the AFSS Work Group to determine the relative risks of such contaminants. The Contractor will:  1.1. Identify and review published scientific literature to obtain information about the presence of microbes in feeds and feed ingredients, and the level(s) at which each microbe has been shown to be present in these products.  The contractor will provide copies of all published scientific literature pertinent to the objective of the search to the Project Officer at the end of the purchase order period. 1.2 Identify and review published scientific literature to obtain information about the disease(s) caused in animals by each of the microbes identified by the Contractor under 1, above and other microbes identified by the Project Manager.  For each disease, the contractor obtain information about: a. The name of the disease(s), b. Its clinical signs and symptoms, c. The infective dose of the causative microbe, d. From reports of outbreaks of diseases, the contractor will obtain the following information: I. The number of animals exposed to the causative microbe in each outbreak  of disease caused by the microbe, II. The number of exposed animals that became sick, III. The clinical signs and symptoms observed in the exposed animals that became sick, and the proportion of sick animals exhibiting each sign and symptom, and IV. The number of exposed animals that became sick and died as a result of the disease.   The contractor will provide copies of all published scientific literature pertinent to the objective of the search to the Project Officer at the end of the purchase order period.  1.3. The contractor will identify and review published scientific literature to obtain information about the disease(s) caused in humans by each of the microbes identified by the contractor during the literature searches in 1 above, and other microbes identified by the Project Manager. For each disease, the contractor will obtain information about:  Consultant Support Services for Microbiological Contaminants in Animal Feed: a. The name of the disease, b. Its clinical signs and symptoms, c) The infective dose of the causative microbe, d. From reports of outbreaks of diseases, the contractor will obtain the following information:  I. The number of persons exposed to the causative microbe in each outbreak of disease caused by the microbe, II. The number of exposed persons that became sick, including the  number that was hospitalized, III. The clinical signs and symptoms expressed by each exposed person that became sick, and the proportion of sick persons exhibiting each sign and symptom, and IV. The number of exposed persons that became sick and died as a result of the disease. The contractor will provide copies of all published scientific literature pertinent to the objective of the search to the Project Officer at the end of the purchase order period. 1.4. The contractor will consult with other pertinent sources and experts (including individuals in universities, regulatory agencies, and industry) to obtain the information specified in 1, 2, and 3, above. The contractor will maintain a list of the sources and individuals consulted (including website addresses and contact information) and the information obtained from them, and will provide this list to the Project Office at the end of the purchase order period. 1.5.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1004641, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Radiation Safety LLC under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to Radiation Safety LLC, 44 Stelton Road, Suite 115, Piscataway, NJ 08854-2600.  There is only one responsible source and  no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons: In the spring of 2002, this contractor designed, developed, tested, evaluated, modified, and implemented an online course that provided instruction to potential FDA and State inspectors through distance learning in the fundamental concepts of radiation physics with emphasis on mammography-related aspects.  Subsequently, the division has maintained a relationship with the contractor whereby he revises and supports the course materials as needed to accommodate feedback from students and changes in our program, as warranted, and provides helpdesk assistance for questions that surface from accessing this training.  Benefits to sole sourcing: With the recent assumption of the CDRH Radiological Health Program and in an effort to fulfill the recommendations contained therein, we now need to broaden the scope of the original “inspector” training offering to include instruction on additional radiation-emitting equipment, including basic radiation physics, diagnostic radiographic and fluoroscopic systems, dental diagnostic systems, computed tomography (CT), radiation therapy systems, and non-medical radiation-emitting equipment, as appropriate.  As the leading expert on the content of the existing online training, this contractor understands our targeted audiences, their needs, our goals in expanding the training to encompass a larger array of module-specific instruction and can adapt the existing format and content in a timely, seamless, and efficient manner.  His performance on the original contract has been exceptional.  He has met all deliverables within the time frames specified and has been extremely responsive to our program, and successfully addresses the needs of our students.  These characteristics and our expectations of continued stellar performance are key components to meeting our emerging and increasing training needs.  Additionally, by contracting with this sole source, we will save both government time and money by building on the existing course materials that have been well received and appropriate for the training of our cadre of potential inspectors.  Additionally, by avoiding unnecessary delays in initiating a new process, we will fulfill our obligations in supporting the radiological health program, meet the demands of our targeted audiences in a timely manner, and invest our resources into prioritizing our remaining training needs.  The contractor will use the existing "all inclusive" radiologic introductory physics course as the foundation for the additional modules to meet FDA's prime objective to prepare MQSA and medical imaging surveyors to fulfill the Agency's regulatory responsibilities.  As with the original online course, the expanded version will be delivered through on-line and CD-Rom methodologies that allow students to train at their own pace, in the time frames convenient to their program and personal schedules and responsibilities; and to minimize costs and the additional time commitment involved in travel and being away from their respective work sites. This approach has been highly successful and has received favorable evaluations by the students taking this training. Most importantly, the intended training will capitalize on the original format, content, and methodologies by offering new modules, visuals, demonstrations, exercise, and laboratory sessions that provide and prepare students with knowledge and expertise to progress to the next required training.  Also included are the necessary pre-testing and testing and registration for up to 30 students to get invaluable feedback.  These reasons, considered in their entirety, are why FDA anticipates a sole source award to Radiation Safety LLC, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 611430 – Professional and Management Development Training and the small business size standard is $6M.  The following are objectives and tasks Radiation Safety LLC will be requested to provide:  Background:  The Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs (DMQRP) has the responsibility of implementing the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH) radiological health program based on the plan signed by the CDRH Director in May 2005.  One of the goals outlined in the plan involved providing meaningful and appropriate training to FDA and State inspectors to properly, efficiently, and effectively perform surveys of medical diagnostic products (e.g., mammography, diagnostic radiographic and fluoroscopic systems, dental diagnostic systems, computed tomography (CT), and radiation therapy), with long-term inclusion of non-medical radiation products.   To accomplish this goal, DMQRP requests the service of Radiation Safety LLC to design, develop, pilot test, evaluate, and offer a fundamental course on basic radiation physics that includes modules specific to radiological health areas as specified.  Since 2002, this company has provided DMQRP with an online basic radiological course specific to mammography equipment.  As the leading expert on the content of the existing online mammography training, they understand our targeted audiences, their needs, our goals in training these audiences, and the time frames associated with offering this training.  Their sustained quality performance has provided students with a resource to ask questions regarding the course materials and the use of the software used for this online instruction. Scope of Work: DMQRP is requesting the expansion of the existing online training to capitalize on the user-friendly format, the fundamental basic radiation information contained in the currently used training, and the expertise previously tapped to develop this training.  This task is a multi-year effort that will be accomplished in a phased-in manner, beginning on the date of award and ending on June 30, 2008.  This task also involves the development and expansion of the current MQSA Inspector Course I (CI) online training to include a number of modules specific to radiation areas as specified above and prioritized by DMQRP after it conducts a full needs assessment of radiological health training needs.  The ultimate goal of this purchase order is to provide comprehensive, online training for FDA and State personnel in the fundamental concepts of basic radiation physics with additional modules covering instruction in specific diagnostic radiation systems (e.g., mammography, diagnostic radiographic and fluoroscopic systems, dental diagnostic systems, computed tomography (CT) systems, and radiation therapy systems, as appropriate) to allow FDA to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities in monitoring these radiation-emitting devices.  Instruction will be delivered through on-line and CD-ROM methodology through modules, visuals, demonstrations, exercises and laboratory sessions providing and preparing the students with knowledge and expertise to progress to the next appropriate level as required.  Helpdesk and maintenance support will be provided as well throughout the duration of the project. There will be deliverables with scheduled due dates.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. 1005035, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Johns Hopkins University under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a simplified acquisition on a sole source basis to Johns Hopkins University, 3400 N. Charles Street, Baltimore, MD 21218-8268.  There is only one responsible source and  no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health is a leader in research among the Schools of Public Health in the U.S.  The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health Preventive Medicine Residency Program is the largest university-based preventive medicine residency program in the United States.  The selective admissions policy of this program results in it’s staffing with highly qualified residents.  The John Hopkins University Preventive Medicine Residency Program has been selected for this project because its residents can, during two or three months rotations working under the preceptorship of FDA/CBER medical epidemiologists, provide useful work output to help advance agency goals to ensure postmarketing surveillance of vaccines and other biologic products.  Particularly significant attributes of the John Hopkins University Preventive Medicine Residency Program include its proximity to FDA’s offices, allowing residents to utilize the substantial resources of the John Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health and the John Hopkins Hospital to advance their projects while working at FDA.  This proximity also prevents the cost and work-detracting personal disruption that may occur when workers relocate to a new area to work for relatively short periods.  Moreover, the Institute for Vaccine Safety in the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health provides additional synergistic collaborative potential for residents in their vaccine safety Projects at CBER.  The residents of the Johns Hopkins University Preventive Medicine Residency Program are among the most talented and productive in the nation, and they will tailor their services to our needs.  The John Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health Preventive Medicine Residency Program will provide residents for two or three-month educational employment experiences (“rotations”) under the supervision of medical epidemiologists of the Vaccine Safety Branch, Division of Epidemiology, Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.  The residents will work primarily on postmarketing vaccine safety research, vaccine adverse events surveillance, risk communication or (if the need arises) similar work involving non-vaccine biologic projects.  These reasons, considered in their entirety, why FDA anticipates a sole source award to Johns Hopkins University, however, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities and they will be reviewed to determine if they are considered qualified.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 541990 – All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services and the small business size standard is $6M. The following are objectives and tasks Johns Hopkins University will be requested to provide: residents for two or three month educational employment experiences ("rotations") under the supervision of medical epidemiologists of the Division of Epidemiology, Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration. The residents will work on post marketing safety adverse event surveillance, risk communication, and research involving vaccines, tissues, and non-vaccine biologics regulated by CBER.  Residents will analyze adverse event reports and present the results of their work at meetings of the Division of Epidemiology such as VAERS Rounds and contribute written summaries when required.  Period of performance is two or three months from date of award.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current ac cess information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RA PIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be all owed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehi cle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicl es must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The C ontractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the g ate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12feet-5inches clearance)  will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12feet-5inch es in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with t he procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charli e or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be a t the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate. The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when t hey are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either  a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor  employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be is sued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC),  to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and  issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification  badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for be ing issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, th e contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identifi cation badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contr actor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an emp loyees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a writt en report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.

The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of w ork under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the f ast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.

Statement of Work
Purpose:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) is soliciting a proposal to install an acoustic structural health monitoring system on both WP-3D aircraft.  Data gathered from the system will be temporarily monitored and interpreted by the contractor with the agreement of the contractor to train AOC personnel to monitor and interpret data and transfer that function to the AOC within a reasonable time.  Installation of the health monitoring system on the second aircraft will be based on the performance of the first installed system.  Installations would occur approximately one year apart.
Background:  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration operate two WP-3D Orion aircraft from their operating location at MacDill AFB, Florida.  The WP-3Ds are the world's premier research aircraft and participate in a wide variety of national and international meteorological, oceanographic and environmental research programs in addition to their widely known use in hurricane research and reconnaissance.  These aircraft are equipped with a variety of scientific instrumentation, radars, and recording systems for both in-situ and remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, the earth, and its environment.  Obtained as new aircraft from the Lockheed production line in the mid-70's, these robust aircraft have led NOAA's continuing effort to monitor and study hurricanes and other severe storms, the quality of the atmosphere, the state of the ocean and its fish population, and climate trends. NOAA has monitored the Navy’s P-3 Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) and concluded that the operating environment of the WP-3Ds is significantly different from the Navy P-3 fleet environment, and that the NOAA Orion’s are subjected to specific stresses and accelerations as a result of their severe weather penetration profiles.  In order to ensure that the aircraft are maintained at the peak of readiness, and that all airworthiness concerns are addressed, NOAA requires that a structural monitoring system be installed on the aircraft that can record and report on the specific condition of the aircraft wing and empennage structure.  
The system must do more than record exceedances, and must be able to report specifically when damage occurs to the structure, and then to pinpoint the location of the damage for maintenance personnel.  In addition, the system must be able to provide a record of the flight such that the maneuvers that were being conducted can be correlated to the damage at the moment it occurs. Requirements:  The selected vendor will provide a structural monitoring system with the following required capabilities: 1.  The system must be capable of monitoring the entire aircraft wing, focusing on the key elements of the P-3 structure as designated by the Navy SLAP program as specific areas of concern. 2.The associated sensors, wiring harnesses and attachment fittings must be capable of being installed on the WP-3D while the aircraft is in depot maintenance, and must be accomplished by a small team within a reasonable period on a not to interfere basis, so that the depot maintenance duration is not prolonged. 3.The system must monitor the aircraft structure continuously through the flight regime, as well as during ground operations such as taxi, takeoff, and landing rollout, and be capable of identifying damage to the structure at the precise moment it occurs.  4.The data collection device in the aircraft must be capable of storing up to 50 flight hours and be readily downloadable for analysis. 5.NOAA maintenance personnel will download the aircraft data and forward to the appropriate organization for analysis.  The analysis of the in-flight structural data must be provided as an included service, and completed within one week of submission of data.  The analysis service must also have the capability to perform a 24 hour turnaround of data if NOAA identifies a specific flight as likely to have caused damage to the aircraft.  6.The analysis will initially be accomplished by the vendor but ultimately will be performed by NOAA personnel.  The vendor will develop appropriate user software so that the analysis can be accomplished locally. 7. Any damage that the system detects must be defined within a 4 inch radius.  The specific location of the structural anomaly should be displayed electronically to the maintenance technician in a CAD drawing of the P-3 wing and empennage structure.  The CAD system must be capable of zooming in or out, panning or rotating the damaged structural part, and identifying it by physical location (i.e., wing station) as well as by part number and nomenclature. 8. The CAD system will not only be used for identifying and locating damage, but will also be used for the training of structural maintenance personnel.  The CAD system must also have the capability of graphically recording repair information so that the digital image can be maintained as a permanent record of repair and structural modification for each aircraft. 9. Although not a Flight Data Recorder with specific crash survivability requirements, the system must be capable of recording up to 24 user-defined inputs for the duration of each flight.  These inputs (i.e., airspeed, altitude, GPS position, angle of bank, control position, etc) must be capable of correlation at the specific time that damage occurs to the structure.  In other words, where was the aircraft, what were the conditions of flight, and what precisely was the aircraft doing when the damage occurred.  The goal of this capability is to be able to review flight procedures and to modify severe weather operating doctrine to minimize damage to the structure. 10. An optional mission replay capability shall be available in which the aircraft can be displayed with elective overlays that will include a geo data base with terrain features. 
Signed and dated offers must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/CRAD, Attn:  Donita McCullough, Room 1756, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106.
