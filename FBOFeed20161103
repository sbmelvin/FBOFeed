If a company is advised that they will not be a viable competitor, they are NOT precluded from submitting a proposal once the actual solicitation is issued.<br /><br />2.3 Limit responses to only what is requested in the Advisory Phase Questionnaire. Additional information provided outside of the questionnaire will not be reviewed and will not be considered in determining the viability of a potential offeror.

The Government WILL NOT reimburse proposal costs stemming from this phase. This is merely an opportunity, given the significant financial investment required to participate in this acquisition, for the Government to advise interested Agencies of their potential to be a viable competitor in this acquisition.

<DESC>The proposed RFP is for Coveralls, Explosive Handler, NSN 8415-00-279-8719(s) /PGC: 00465. Subject item is made in accordance with specification NCTRF PD 14610J dated February 20, 2009. The solicitation will be issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside, and awarded under an Indefinite Delivery Type Contract. The resultant contract will be for a base year and three (3) one-year term options. The base year and each of the three one-year option terms will have a minimum quantity of 1,365EA, an annual estimated quantity of 4,035 EA and an annual order limitation quantity of 5,044 EA. All materials used in the fabrication are to be furnished by the successful offeror. Delivery of the first shipment is scheduled for 150 days after date of award.

<p>Best Value Tradeoff Source Selection Procedures will be used. The following evaluation factors are incorporated into the solicitation:<br />1. Product Demonstration Model (PDM)<br />2. Past Performance Confidence Assessment<br />A Production Demonstration Model (PDM) will be required to accompany each proposal. One (1) coverall shall be submitted.<br />It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted to the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) on or after November 2016. All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). All responsible sources may submit offers which, if received in timely fashion, shall be considered.<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx. <br />Important Note on Foreign Content: <br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment" impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.<br />-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------<br />Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.<br />DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.<br />The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/<br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance.)</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT MODIFICATION WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201 and 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action.
<p>This is a notice of intent to extend the services provided under NIEHS Contract Number N01ES75564 with Research Triangle Institute. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and delays in service make competition not feasible for the extension. Award of the modification is subject to Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approval.<br /><br />The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to issue a sole-source modification to extend the performance period of Contract Number N01ES75564 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1. This extension will provide the National Toxicology Program (NTP) with service and support for end-of-contract activities on the Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB) contract for up to one (1) year beyond the current expiration date of December 15, 2016. RTI is the only source capable of providing uninterrupted and comprehensive service to NIEHS to finalize the work under the RACB contract. RTI, as the incumbent contractor, is the only source that can provide the access to the necessary staff and information that will be needed to clarify questions on final reports and to provide additional information that may be necessary. Because RTI is the contractor that performed the studies and drafted the reports, it is the only contractor that has access to the data and is capable of providing the expertise to interpret, clarify and, if necessary, provide updated/corrected information from final reports that have been submitted under the contract. Failure to extend the contract will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's congressionally mandated requirements. A recompetition of this contract is NOT expected.<br /><br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses from interested parties received within fifteen (15) days of this posting. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. NIEHS will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice.<br /><br />ONLY EMAIL RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED. Please email responses regarding this requirement to: smithj3@niehs.nih.gov.</p>

The anticipated contract will provide maintenance and repair services on STRYKER-manufactured equipment in support of Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune.

STRYKER is the proprietary repair source of all STRYKER manufactured medical equipment and does not authorize any third party vendors to repair equipment or purchase repair parts.     The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219 with a size standard of $20.5 million.
 A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 03 November 2016 by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows:  http:// www.neco.navy.mil.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.
 Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Please direct all questions regarding this requirement via e-mail to the POC identified in this synopsis.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 However, all bids, proposals, or quotations received by the closing response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Jessica Hillsley, Contract Specialist, Phone 3128863313, Email jessica.hillsley@gsa.gov
<DESC>GS05P17SAC0002<br />SYNOPSIS
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure Building Automation Integration for the Robert W. Kastenmeier Federal Courthouse, 120 N Henry Street, Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>GSA's Public Building Services (PBS) office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is working to integrate the building systems onto GSA's Building Systems Network (BSN). This project includes, but is not limited to, installing fully licensed Niagara N4 software including any tools required to manage existing devices and new controllers. The contractor shall develop and integrate graphics utilizing the Niagara framework. Contractor shall provide software and associated licensing for a Niagara 4 Supervisor that would be applied to a GSA server. Graphics shall represent all the data that currently exists in the Continuum system. Public Building Services System Support (PSS) shall provide virtual servers that meet the specifications required by the Building Automation System (BAS) server software unless technical limitation prevents virtualization of the server software. BAS contractor shall update server software to latest revision and provide minimum five (5) client communication sessions.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish and install Java Application Control Engine (JACE) 8000 to replace existing Infinet IP controllers. JACE controller(s) shall be configured to allow for the reuse of existing Infinet bus while giving the building future options for BACnet device replacement. This may only require one JACE; however, the contractor shall collaborate with GSA to determine the best approach that complies with referenced requirements. Replacement Niagara N4 controllers and software shall be configured to utilize existing devices and sequences as currently utilized in the Continuum BAS.</p>
<p>This procurement is unrestricted and open to all business concerns. The NAICS code is 238210 (Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors), with a size standard of $15 million. This is a negotiated best value procurement. Proposals will be evaluated on price and non-price factors. A pre-proposal conference with site visit is tentatively scheduled to occur during the week beginning November 29, 2016 (the actual dates and details will be stated in the solicitation). The solicitation will be available on or about November 17, 2016; the actual date for receipt of proposals will be stated in the solicitation. The solicitation will be available for download through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (fedbizopps.gov) website. All interested vendors must be registered with this website in order to download the solicitation and amendments. Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring FBO for amendments and/or additional information. All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>All offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), located at www.sam.gov, in order to be considered for award.</p>
<p>See the forthcoming solicitation for more information.<br />Because these specifications are performance based, it is the responsibility of the offeror to review the entire solicitation and base their proposal on this forthcoming solicitation.</p>

Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f) and 52.215-1(c).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission.

Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.

To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.

Password protecting your SF-330 is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated Government individuals.

The selection of the most qualified contractor will follow the guidance provided in FAR 36.6   Architect-Engineer Services.  Additionally, this solicitation is also issued in accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare Information and Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502 and 503, as a set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contractors. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to SDVOSB construction firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB contractors will be received under this solicitation. 

Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF-330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal/SF-330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.

<DESC>Cockpit Control and Display Unit (CCDU)<br />Sources Sought
<p>The Department of Defense, United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), 96th Test Wing, is currently conducting market research seeking capabilities statement from potential sources, including small businesses (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned (EDWOSB), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB) small business that are capable of providing aircraft smart cockpit control panel displays to serve as a control head for specialized instrumentation systems installed in military jet aircraft. The Cockpit Control and Display Unit (CCDU) is required to command and control recorders, transmitters, provide for discrete (ON/OFF) controls of instrumentation components (radar transponders/beacon, cameras, etc.); all of which are a part of the onboard Data Acquisition System (DAS). The CCDU will replace the obsolete control panel and will provide improved capabilities for cyber security, for data display and for growth.</p>
<p>The Government requires commercially available products that meet the definition of a commercial item in FAR 2.101. The operational requirements dictate that the CCDU comply with lighting suitable for use with Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and must meet standards for compatibility with the operational environment. A ruggedized CCDU suitable in the operating environment is required. Considerations for crew safety, utility, and mission suitability are paramount.</p>
<p>The CCDU shall incorporate the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The CCDU must communicate via Ethernet with instrumentation remote units which serve as personality adapters and in-turn communicate serially with the various DAS components. The CCDU provides operator feedback on the system status and displays essential data and video to the operators.</p>
<p>The CCDU shall provide a minimum 4.0-inch (in.) diagonal viewing area Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display (AMLCD) screen with the overall dimensions not exceeding 5.750 in. width, 3.360 in. height, and 4.500 in. depth behind the mounting plane.</p>
<p>All interested vendors shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these items to the Point of Contacts listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, and the small business size standard is 1250 employees. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: All interested vendors shall submit a capabilities statement that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide/perform the requirement stated in this notice. The capabilities statement should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirement. The response must not exceed 15 pages.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is for planning and information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. For the purpose of this acquisition, the NAICS code is 611699, All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction and the small business size standard if $11M.</p>
<p>Information received in response to this notice will be used to further define the government's requirement and determine if two (2) or more capable small businesses respond with information sufficient to support a small business set-aside. We encourage all small business concerns, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement.</p>
<p>The mission of the United States Army Level C Full Spectrum Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) Course is to ensure each student graduates with the confidence and appropriate proficiency level to employ SERE and individual Personnel Recovery (PR) tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) necessary to survive and return with honor regardless of the circumstances of isolation. Students are comprised of those individuals whose duties place them at a high risk of isolation or capture, as defined by DODI 1300.21, DODI 1300.23, AR 350-1 &amp; the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). All Officers who have branched Aviation are required to graduate from the U.S. Army level C SERE School at Fort Rucker prior to attending flight school unless they have previously attended another level C SERE School.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is issued for maximizing competition. Should anything in the requirement be construed as limiting competition, please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-2269. Include the subject of the acquisition. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>Please provide a concise capability brief that includes:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Provide responses to the attached Industry Questionnaire.</p>
<p>3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Address any subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement you may use to perform the requirement to include possible "similarly situated entities" (same small business status) subcontractor(s).</p>
<p>4. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>5. Recommendations to improve the Army's approach/draft PWS (Attachment 1) to acquiring the services.</p>

<p><br />Since our last Industry Day in June 2016, the Department has issued two Requests for Information PIVOT - Integrator (PIVOT-I) and for PIVOT - Hosting (PIVOT-H) and continues preparing for the release of the five PIVOT Requests for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The Department is currently finalizing the documentation for the PIVOT-I RFP, with an anticipated release of the end of November 2016/early December 2016. The Department is also planning the release of the PIVOT-H RFP in late December 2016/early January 2017. The Department will release these two solicitations under the NITAAC CIO-SP3 contract vehicle.</p>
<p>The Department received a significant amount of information in response to the four Requests for Information (RFI) it has issued during the past year. The Department believes the information it has received is sufficient to obviate the need for additional RFIs for two of the remaining three contracts: PIVOT - Network (PIVOT-N) and PIVOT - Oversight (PIVOT-O). The Department plans to issue RFPs for these remaining contracts in the December 2016 to February 2017 timeframe.</p>
<p>The PIVOT-N solicitation is planned to be released through the GSA Networx contract vehicle. The Department plans to migrate all PIVOT-N services to the new GSA EIS contract vehicle in the 2018 timeframe.</p>
<p>The PIVOT-O solicitation is planned to be released through the CIO-SP3 small business contract vehicle and, at this time, the Department is strongly considering the option of designated the procurement as a 100% service disabled veteran-owned small business set aside.</p>
<p>The PIVOT - Printing (PIVOT-P) solicitation is planned to be released through the NASA SEWP V contract vehicle (an RFI may be released on NASA SEWP to further explore the potential for PIVOT-P to also be a socio-economically disadvantaged business set aside).</p>

<SUBJECT>CLARREO Pathfinder Reflected Solar (RS) Instrument
<SOLNBR>SS_CLARREO_RS
<RESPDATE>111716
<CONTACT>Robert Bradley Gardner, Contracting Officer, Phone 7578642525, Email Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov - Timothy P. Cannella, Supervisory Contracting Officer , Phone 7578645028, Email timothy.p.cannella@nasa.gov
<DESC>Langley Research Center (LaRC) seeks organizations which demonstrate the ability to supply a reflected solar instrument calibrated to the rigorous accuracy standards of the CLARREO Pathfinder Mission. Providing the reflected solar instrument is one important component; however, an equally important component is to provide the calibration capability and expertise that achieves the required measurement accuracy.
<p>The CLARREO Pathfinder Mission will demonstrate essential technologies and associated measurements from space necessary for future high-accuracy, long-term climate change trend observations. Pathfinder's success depends heavily upon the ability to develop a verifiable on-orbit Syst&egrave;me International d'Unit&eacute;s (SI)-traceable calibration to make highly accurate, spectrally-resolved measurements of Earth solar reflectance. CLARREO Pathfinder will also demonstrate the ability to transfer this calibration to other Earth-observing assets - such as the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments and Visible-Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments - thereby improving the accuracy of those observations.</p>
<p>The instrument must meet International Space Station (ISS) program requirements to receive a Certificate of Flight (CoF) and be manifested to ISS. CLARREO Pathfinder will be a Class D mission per NPR 8705.4 and Category 3 per NPR 7120.5E. The anticipated launch readiness date is in the calendar year 2020-2021 timeframe. System performance requirements are provided in the following sections.<br />Reflected Solar (RS) Instrument<br />The primary data product from the RS instrument is Earth spectral reflectance. The following is a description of the necessary capabilities of the RS instrument:<br />&bull; The instrument shall have calibrated spectral response spanning at least 350 to 2300 nm. <br />&bull; The instrument spectral sampling shall be at least 4 nm sampling and 8 nm resolution.<br />&bull; The instrument shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable spectrally-resolved Earth reflectances referenced to spectral solar irradiance with average uncertainty &lt;= 0.3% (k=1) for the 350 - 2300 nm wavelength range.<br />&bull; The instrument shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable broadband (350 - 2300 nm) spectrally-integrated Earth reflectance with uncertainty &lt;= 0.3% (k=1), with spectral accuracy weighted using global average Earth spectrally reflected energy.<br />&bull; The instrument polarization sensitivity to a 100% polarized input shall be &lt; 0.50% (k=2) in wavelength from 350 nm to 2300 nm. <br />&bull; The instrument shall have pointing capability to allow it to match the view in time, space, and viewing angle of sensors being inter-calibrated (e.g., CERES and VIIRS) and to view the sun and moon.<br />&bull; The instrument shall have the ability to collect Earth, Sun and Moon observations with a pointing accuracy &le; 0.025 degrees.<br />&bull; The CLARREO Reflected Solar Pathfinder instrument shall have a geo-located nadir field-of-view &lt; 0.5 km with a swath width of &ge; 70 km.<br />&bull; The CLARREO Pathfinder prime mission operations period shall be 12 months following on-orbit commissioning.</p>
<p><br />ISS program requirements<br />Environmental and interface requirements derive from the following assumptions: The CLARREO Pathfinder RS payload will be launched upon a commercial resupply vehicle to the ISS. The CLARREO Pathfinder RS payload will be robotically installed as an externally-attached payload on the ISS at Expedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (ExPRESS), ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC)-1, at the Passive Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (FRAM) Adapter Plate 3 (PFAP 3).<br />Governing documents:<br />General useful information, including the external payloads proposers' guide that describes ISS accommodations (pallets, power, thermal, field of view, microgravity, electromagnetics, etc.), integration, launch vehicle, flight and ground safety, and ISS provided hardware, are available here: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/facilities_category/index.html<br />ISS Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (FRAM) based payload common requirements are contained in NASA SSP 57012.<br />ISS flight safety requirements are contained in the following documents:<br />1. Safety Policy and requirements for payloads using ISS NASA NSTS 1700.7B w/ NASA NSTS 1700.7B ISS Addendum as a guide (available by request)<br />2. Interpretation of NSTS/ISS payload safety requirements NSTS/ISS 18798 (available by request)<br />3. ISS safety requirements document NASA SSP 50021 (available by request)<br />4. Safety review process NASA SSP 30599 (available by request)<br />5. Attached Payload Interface Requirements Document NASA SSP-57003 (available by request)<br />The following additional useful documents are available online:<br />1. Payload Developers and Principal Investigators Payload Planning, Integration and Operations Primer: NASA OZ-10-056<br />2. Overview of Attached Payload Accommodations and Environments on the International Space Station: NASA/TP-2007-214768<br />3. Falcon 9 user's guide<br />Response Instructions<br />A response to this RFI does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts or other agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the responders would provide (at no cost to NASA) pertinent instrument designs and drawings, operational concepts, calibration and characterization definition and planning, payload constraints/interface analysis, and descriptions of prior relevant instrument development/calibration experience and demonstrated capability. Responses, and the ability for responders to meet the above instrument system requirements, will be assessed by LaRC.</p>
<p>Responses will be assessed against the following criteria: (1) Technical Capability. The responder shall describe their technical capabilities required for the performance of the activity described herein. Of significant importance are, a demonstrated reflected solar instrument development and calibration capability (TRL 6) and an approach for instrument availability to meet a 2020/2021 launch window. (2) Payload Accommodation and Mission Support. The responder shall demonstrate an understanding of accommodating optical payloads on ISS and an assessment if their design fits within the defined volume/power on the ELC. (3) Cost and Schedule. The responder shall provide cost and schedule data for the design, fabrication, assembly, test and calibration of their instrument. Preference given to vendors with adequate and complete proposed cost, cost reserves, and schedule reserves. The responder shall provide a rough order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for (a) developing and integrating the payload on to an ExPa pallet and delivering the representative payload to Kennedy Space Center and (b) flight operation mission phases (one year of operations followed by one year of data analysis). (4) Mission Management and Participating Organizations. The responder shall provide a brief summary of the proposed teaming arrangements, as applicable, identifying key personnel. (5) Relevant Experience and Past Performance. The responder shall include relevant recent experience and past performance in similar development activities.</p>
<p>Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to a 30 page PowerPoint presentation electronic file, limited to 12 Mb in size, in either PowerPoint or PDF format. Responses must address the aforementioned assessment criteria.</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted to NASA LaRC via e-mail by November 17, 2016 to: rosemary.r.baize@nasa.gov and robert.b.gardner@nasa.gov. Procurement questions should be directed to: robert.b.gardner@nasa.gov.</p>

Nationally certified Sign Language Interpreters shall be used for director s call meeting, staff meetings, work groups, training, one-on-one meetings with supervisors, business discussions, performance appraisals, counseling, and various events which may arise. A full-time sign language interpreter is on staff in the Denver office; however, there are times when 2 interpreters may be required, the staff interpreter may be absent, or have conflicting appointments to interpret. There are also Deaf employees in the Las Vegas and Ann Arbor offices. The Government interpreter will need an outside interpreting service to substitute when otherwise unavailable and to provide services outside of the Denver area. The contract interpreter agency shall respond to requests for services Mondays through Friday during normal business hours; 7:30AM   4:00PM, acknowledging receipt of request  within 1 hour  of notification.

Contract interpreters shall be required to check in with the VA security office and call the POC for all situations while entering the VHA CC complex. POC s will vary depending on the department requiring interpreting services. Event locations may vary as there are several deaf employees in different departments. If the staff interpreter or deaf employee realizes the agency interpreter is uncertified or incapable of interpreting the message accurately, truthfully and, faithfully the interpreter shall be dismissed as a breach of the terms and conditions of the contract. In such an event, another interpreter will be called at the expense of the contractor. Services shall be carried out within the terms and conditions, with the exception of National Holidays.

<DESC>The US Army, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), seeks industry partners interested in entering cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA) supporting the Army's efforts to develop Cluster Munition Replacement Technologies (CMRT). Interested industry partners and ARDEC will be responsible for funding their respective activities under any CRADAs; no ARDEC funding will be provided.
<p>Over the next three years, ARDEC will significantly invest in the exploration of systems and component technologies that address the pending loss of Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM). ARDEC is leading efforts to address the Army's Science and Technology Objective (STO) for CRMT and DPICM replacement technologies. Three design options are being explored under the CMRT STO as potential material solutions for consideration in the FY17-21 Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munition (ELCM) Program of Record for the replacement of legacy Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions.</p>
<p>ARDEC is seeking component technologies that augment, refine or mitigate risk associated with the areas highlighted below.</p>
<p>Munition for Armored Combat Engagement (MACE) - an enhanced unitary projectile that employs anti-personnel and anti-materiel lethal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Potential areas of collaboration include:</p>
<p>Warhead (lethal mechanisms, gun launch survivability)Energetics</p>
<p>Multipoint Initiation/fuze compatibility</p>
<p>Proximity Initiated Submunition (PRAXIS) - full bore, side attack submunition with proximity, time and impact mode fuzes.</p>
<p>Potential areas of collaboration include:</p>
<p>Warhead (lethal mechanisms)<br />Stabilizer and despin producibility<br />Fuzing (power sources, safe and arm devices)</p>
<p><br />Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition Extra Large (DPICM-XL) - larger submunitions than DPICM that uses similar lethal mechanisms yet provides more fuze volume to incorporate high reliability fuzing components.</p>
<p>Potential areas of collaboration include:</p>
<p>Warhead (shaped charge jet producibility)</p>
<p>Fuzing (power sources, safe and arm devices, overall fuzing architecture)</p>
<p>ARDEC asks all interested parties to submit a short informational paper to include but not limited to: technology description, media (photos, 3-d models) and estimated performance information. Interested industry partners outside of the United States of America may request participation, but authorization for such participation cannot be guaranteed. Submissions should be sent to Ryan Gorman, 973.724.6149, ryan.p.gorman4.civ@mail.mil. All submissions must be provided by December 1, 2016. These information papers should describe how the interested partners' may meet the objectives cited above. This may include a summary of the technology relevant expertise, facilities, experience, and resource commitment.<br /><br />Based on the whitepapers and technology proposals received in response to this notice, ARDEC will conduct an initial assessment of the technologies and determine which CRADA partnerships to pursue. ARDEC respects the importance of corporate intellectual property and data security while balancing the need to document the benefits of public expenditures. Provisions relating to proprietary information and intellectual property shall be set forth in the CRADA.</p>
<p>ARDEC seeks Government Purpose License Rights to the inventions, data and software developed under any CRADAs in order to allow a future acquisition program to be conducted using full and open competition. Industry partners are required to make a declarative statement of asserted Limited Rights being offered to the Government for technologies provided under each respective CRADA.</p>
<p>As stated above, companies participating in CRADAs will be responsible for funding their own activities. The Government will be responsible for providing all necessary materiel needed to assess and test the component technology (metal parts, fuzing, stabilizers, projectiles, etc.) in component, system, laboratory, and ballistic firing.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of any responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. All information received will be used for planning and market research purposes only.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>CUSIP Global Services - SS-OFR-17-004</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), intends to make award to CUSIP Global Services (CGS) of CAPITAL IQ, INC, 55 Water Street, 49th Floor | New York, NY 10041-0004 on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Subscription Services.</p>
<p>The Office of Financial Research (OFR) requires proprietary financial information regarding the classification and proper identification of North American financial instruments by country, company of origin, and type. The CUSIP is a nine-character alphanumeric code that identifies a North American financial security for the purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of financial trades and is the primary identification code of the financial instrument information that (OFR) requires.</p>
<p>Through market research the CUSIP Master File has been found to be the only source to proprietary financial information regarding the classification and proper identification of North American financial instruments by country, company, and type. Given that OFR must be able to automatically identify a financial instrument's country, company of origin, and type in order to sort and classify data for financial research and analysis, CUSIP Global Services (CGS) is the only source of the trademarked, proprietary data.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than 14:00 (2:00 PM EST) November 15, 2016. Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: RG/BB.REF SS-OFR-17-004. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested requirement. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to CUSIP Global Services (CGS) of CAPITAL IQ, INC.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors must provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.). Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>2. Whether your services are available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.</p>
<p>3. A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers your company currently provides these products/services for.</p>
<p>4. DUNS Number.</p>
<p>The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>
<p>.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time.</p>
<p>This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.</p>

<p>C. Scope<br />The purpose of the proposed work is to assist in the development of courses designed to fill existing gaps in human performance curricula currently being offered/available to the USDA Forest Service (USFS) and wildland fire community. This curriculum is to be informed by the theoretical paper developed through the collaboration between USFS Office of Innovation and Organizational Learning (IOL) and University of Texas at Austin, applying the science of Complex Adaptive System (CAS) to USFS incidents and accidents.

Content should be appropriate for at least 1 two hour course<br />b. To be delivered within the period of performance (12/31/2016 - 12/31/17)</p>
<p>3. The third deliverable will be based on the same contextual learning developed in the first deliverable, but will be formatted for delivery to the NLC. The vendor will work in collaboration with IOL to draft a course outline for delivery to the NLC that focuses on Complexity and Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) &amp;shares findings from the theoretical paper that could be useful to leadership. . Deliverable will be a draft outline of the course. The vendor will participate in one session (either via VTC/online or in person).<br />a. Content should be appropriate for 2 one hour courses, or one two hour course<br />b. To be delivered within the period of performance (12/31/2016 - 12/31/17)</p>

<DESC><span id="ctl00_PageMainContent_DisplayedText">Urgent non-competitive award to furnish and place rock to reduce further erosion of riverbank adjacent to Hoh road, Olympic National Park, Washington; emergency stabilization supported by the following justification (original signed document on file).&nbsp; Awarded as P17PX00008.<br /><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,500 ($2,000/$2,500 for Construction/Services) AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)<br /><br />Date: 10/15/16 PR Number: 0040306110 <br /><br />1. Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):<br />This purchase order (PO) is for heavy equipment and trucking with operator/drivers to perform emergency bank stabilization on the Hoh Road within Olympic National Park. In the late afternoon of 10/13/16, pictures were sent out by NPS law enforcement employees of a ~100-foot section of bank at Milepost 5.5, showing that the river had eroded and would soon be into the road bench. Given the forecast of continuing heavy rains, some kind of stabilization was needed within 24 hours or the road could potentially be completely lost. The performance period of this contract will be longer than that required to make the initial emergency repairs, so that if the temporary fix is subsequently eroded, we have the ability to quickly remobilize the contractor to perform additional emergency repairs.<br /><br />The PO may require the contractor to purchase fill material (gravel and/or rock) and truck it to the site. The equipment/operator prices will have its own firm fixed price per hour (which includes equipment, fuel, and operator). The PO will be awarded with a firm obligation of $33,000, representing our estimate of the value of planned work during the initial emergency repairs. Funds may be added if the temporary fix is subsequently eroded or if the circumstances require additional rock beyond the original estimated quantities and values. NPS will evaluate each situation to determine if we can make the repairs with our own equipment and operators.<br /><br />2. Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):<br />______ Only one responsible source. <br />__X__ Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement. Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. <br />______ Other: <br /><br />Explain: A major storm was forecasted to move into the area beginning 10/13/16 and becoming stronger throughout the weekend. An evaluation of the Hoh Road on the afternoon of 10/13/16 showed that if some sort of stabilization didn&iquest;t happen the next morning, the entire road was at risk to be lost, with a chance that it could over the night. Filling with a sole source was the only option, as finding a vendor that had the availability, resources and ability to mobilize and perform the work in less than 24 hours was urgent. <br /><br />3. Market Research. Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: <br />Brief market research was performed, which indicated that there is only one firm nearby that can mobilize quickly and perform the work required with minimal advance notice; other firms&iquest; equipment was already hired out for similar storm-related work. A local construction contractor, Bruch &amp; Bruch Construction, is currently working on NPS construction contracts and has performed several previous construction contracts, including on the Hoh Road. They are familiar with the special conditions of the road, including narrow widths, tight turns, and steep drop-offs.<br /><br />Hourly prices for the heavy equipment are comparable to current prices on similar POs issued for work in Olympic National Park.<br /><br />4. If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:<br />a. Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. <br />b. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a). <br /><br />Prepared and signed by Cody Manzer, Roads Branch Supervisor, Olympic National Park, 10/15/16<br />Concurred and signed by Sarah Welch, Contracting Officer, North Cascades NPS Complex, 10/15/16<br />Approved and signed by Rodney Roberson, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Olympic Major Acquisition Buying Office and Warranted Individual One Level Above Contracting Officer, 10/17/16</span>

The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the specialty concerned.

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

The award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirement herein and will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<DESC><p>The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the&nbsp;purchase of pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF is hereby&nbsp;issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.</p>
<p>(Required) The next quarterly P&amp;T Committee Meeting Date is February 2017. Go to http://www.health.mil/About-MHS/Other-MHS-Organizations/DoD-PT-Committee webpage and go to the appropriate DoD P&amp;T Committee Meeting date. On this page, pharmaceutical manufacturers&nbsp;will find information on the pre-proposal teleconference, how to register, and how to schedule a clinical presentation.</p>

As such, the contractor is not an employee of the U.S. Government and it is solely the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility to determine his/her reporting and payment responsibilities under Host Nation tax and labor laws. Status as a member of the U.S. Forces under the NATO SOFA Supplementary Agreement does not in itself relieve the contractor of responsibilities under Host Nation laws. Contractor should consult appropriate authorities and advisors on these matters. Department of Defense military and civilian personnel will not provide advice in these matters. Contractor shall hold harmless the U.S. Government for any liability that may arise from the contractor&rsquo;s noncompliance with Host Nation laws. </span></p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>252.204-7004 Alternate A, System for Award Management (May 2013)</p>
<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active."</p>
<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

<p>"Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s): Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs."</p>
<p>The 354th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualification packages and past performance information from vendors interested in providing professional architect and engineering services at Eielson AFB, AK to design the replacement of the complete HVAC system in Building 1138.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Eielson Air Force Base (EAFB) is located approximately 23 miles southeast of Fairbanks, AK. Building 1138 was original built in 1959 and has undergone an addition and numerous interior projects. It is home to several Red Flag contractors. Building 1138 is sitting on or within the buffer zones of two contaminated soil sites (DP044 and SS530). The HVAC system is in poor condition. This project will repair building 1138's HVAC system by replacement so the building may be properly heated and ventilated. The domestic water heating system is in poor condition as well. This project will repair building 1138's domestic water heating tank/system by replacement. The Building is a historical building and every effort shall be taken to not affect its exterior appearance. Asbestos has been abated with previous projects, but some is still present throughout the building. Presence of lead based paint should be expected.</p>
<p>This is a competitive selection process in which competing offeror's qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 36.603(b): To be considered for architect-engineer contracts, a firm must file with the appropriate office or board the Standard Form 330, "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part II and when applicable, SF 330, Part I. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this posting; all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Failure to respond to this post does not preclude participation in the subsequent technical evaluation so long as a firm's SF 330 is currently on file with the 354th Contracting Squadron. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being solicited on a 100% Small Business Set-aside basis. The NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a small business size standard of $15M. The Disclosure of Magnitude for the subsequest construction project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 IAW FAR 36.204(f).</p>
<p>The work to be performed shall include but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Attending a pre-investigation meeting<br />2. Investigating site conditions, options, etc.<br />3. Collecting and reviewing project data and records<br />4. Developing design concepts and cost estimates <br />5. Submitting an investigation report<br />6. Attending review meetings<br />7. Making the revisions requested by the Government<br />8. Submitting intermediate design documents<br />9. Producing a complete design (35%, 65%, 95%, and 100% submissions)</p>
<p>A-E EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS: A-E's experience shall include that which is commensurate with the requirements specific to the scope of design.</p>

<p>The Air Force requires complete and functional designs that are appropriate for the sub-arctic environment for interior Alaska and that meet all applicable Federal, State, Local, Industry, U.S. Air Force and Eielson AFB requirements.</p>
<p>The A-E shall be responsible for all travel and lodging arrangements and expenses involved in the performance of work under this contract. The A-E shall furnish the Air Force with complete and usable products to include: planning documents, investigative reports, study reports, design analyses, project drawings, technical provisions (specifications), equipment layouts, cost estimates, submittal registers, quality assurance plans, constructability review reports, construction bidding amendments, construction contract modifications, and other documents.</p>

<SUBJECT>Construction Manager as Construction for the 985 Michigan Avenue Building Modernization and Backfill Project
<SOLNBR>GS-05-P-17-GB-C-0001
<RESPDATE>121916
<CONTACT>Alexandra M Huber, Contract Specialist, Phone 312-279-8149, Email alexandra.huber@gsa.gov - Gregory C Oprian, Contracting Officer, Phone 312-353-3476, Email Gregory.Oprian@gsa.gov
<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The General Services Administration (GSA), Great Lakes Region 5, announces an opportunity to provide Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services for the 985 Michigan Avenue Federal Building Modernization and Backfill Project in Detroit, Michigan. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Design Stage Services and an option for Construction Stage Services.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The CMc will be competitively chosen using source selection (FAR 15) procedures. The objective of the source selection process is to select a proposal that represents the best value to the Government. The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and offers the best value to the Government, considering the technical factors and the total evaluated price. For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price (FAR 15.101-1, Trade Offs). The technical factors will include Experience in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services on similar projects, to be defined in the Request for Proposal; Project Management Plan/Approach; Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel; Past Performance in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services on similar projects, and Project Labor Agreement. Additionally, Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) compliance shall represent a go/no-go factor. The Contractor must demonstrate their compliance with CAS through the submittal of all disclosures in accordance with FAR 52.230-1, Cost Accounting Standards Notice and Certifications and FAR 52.230-7, Proposal Disclosure - Cost Accounting Practice Changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers, but discussions may be held if appropriate. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $60,000,000.00 to $80,000,000.00. The Design Stage Services are anticipated to commence upon award of the contract on or about April 2017. The optional Construction Stage Work is anticipated to be awarded in or around November 2017, with a performance period of approximately 924 days.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The requirement for this opportunity includes restacking the IRS within the building and renovating their current space, as well as renovating building vacant space for incoming tenants and altering major mechanical, electrical and fire protection equipment throughout the building. IRS, including its print shop, currently occupies the building. IRS needs to consolidate space, and plans to do so by reconfiguring space within the 985 Michigan Avenue Building to implement new workplace strategies, and to consolidate offices currently at 985 with offices currently in leased space. They have requested a total of approximately 200,000 USF of space in the 985 Michigan Avenue Building to accommodate this move and restacking effort. GSA proposes that at least 7 other agencies move leases into the 985 Michigan Avenue Building with varying space requirements. This project will aim to achieve LEED CI Gold and is currently registered under LEED Version 3. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor: A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction stages, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to: evaluating design concepts, monitoring A/E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Stage Services and Construction Stage Services. The Contractor is required to complete the Design Stage Services for the firm-fixed-price set forth in the Contract Price Schedule. If the Government exercises the option for the Construction Stage Services, the contractor shall complete the Construction Stage Services at or below the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). The CMc is responsible for confirming all existing conditions that are readily accessible for viewing, investigating, surveying, scanning, or otherwise knowable. The CMc is responsible for recommending design stage investigative demolition where such efforts may help identify the work required to complete the project.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joint Ventures: Joint venture or firm/ consultant arrangements will be considered and must submit an acceptable joint venture agreement. Acceptable JV is the continuity of warranty coverage by the surviving entity after completion of the project should the JV be dissolved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The solicitation package will be available on or about November 18, 2016. The solicitation package will only be available electronically. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation from the FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov, and for monitoring for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be held in Detroit, Michigan on or about December 6, 2016. A link to the Pre-Proposal Registration Form will be included in the solicitation posting, and anyone interested in attending the pre-proposal conference shall complete the form and submit it no later than one week prior to the pre-proposal conference. Please note, the number of people attending will be limited to three individuals per company/team. We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting will not be accepted as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers. The offers will be due on or about December 19, 2016.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All responsible sources may submit a bid/proposal which shall be considered by the agency. In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM), which can be accessed at: https://www.sam.gov. An award is anticipated on or about April, 2017.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

The award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirement herein and will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Patient Scales. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Patient Scales products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific, and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Patient Scales in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Patient Scales will be established approximately April 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Patient Scales. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Patient Scales.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Patient Scales. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $379,302. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 50.2% ($190,548.91) of the total volume in sales ($379,302). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy). <br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<p>QUESTION #1: Would you consider adding the shipping and the DEA transaction fee as a separate line item on the solicitation?</p>
<p>ANSWER #1: No. Adding a separate line item (and altering the submission requirements/format accordingly) would be irrelevant to the evaluation criteria and basis for award. The RFQ stands as originally published.</p>
<p>QUESTION #2: Stated on the synopsis, "NIST intends to award one purchase order as a result of this RFQ." Will all products be ordered at one time (one time purchase) or will they ordered as needed?</p>
<p>ANSWER #2: Although split shipments will be authorized (to allow the successful vendor some flexibility in getting the chemicals to NIST by the 60 days ARO deadline, NOT to get them to NIST on an as-needed basis), all products will be ordered at one time via the issuance of one purchase order.</p>
<p>AMENDMENT 1 CONCLUDED: NO FURTHER QUESTIONS SHALL BE RECEIVED AT THIS TIME.<br />*********************************************************</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place</span>:<br /></strong><br />Mr. Gunasekaran Sankar<br />Senior Technical Services Manager<br />Indian Oil Corporation Limited<br />Refineries Headquarters, SCOPE Complex, Core-2,<br />7, Institutional Area, Lodhi Road<br />New Delhi 110003<br />Phone:  +91-11-24360246<br />Mobile No:  +91-8826823012<br />Email: sankarg@indianoil.in<br /><br />
<p>Petroleum Coke Utilization:  The Indian Oil Corporation Limited ("Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Grantee that will assist the Grantee review options to economically convert refinery byproducts, specifically petroleum coke (petcoke), into various chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and power generation.</p>
<p>Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) is India's largest public sector undertaking (PSU) accounting for approximately half of the country's refining capacity. IOCL currently operates nine refineries (Guwahati, Barauni, Koyali (Gujarat), Haldia, Mathura, Panipat, Bongaigaon, Digboi, and Paradip), except Mathura Refinery all other Refineries have coke producing capability. IOCL's coke production will almost double between 2015 and 2018 with the commissioning of two new delayed coker units at the Haldia and Paradip Refineries. At the same time environmental emission standards are becoming more stringent, and given this scenario IOCL will be producing an excess amount of petcoke. Thus both economic considerations and environmental compliance constraints means that IOCL must alleviate its excess petcoke situation starting around 2018.</p>
<p>IOCL requires a detailed feasibility study (FS) to review options to economically convert refinery byproducts into various chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and power generation.  The FS will include an analysis and forecast of the international, regional, and domestic demand for petcoke, a review of applicable regulations that will influence the consumption of petcoke and the implementation of any petcoke-based project in India, as well as a model capable of simulating the technical and economic options that are available to IOCL.  In particular, the company is interested in technologies to convert petcoke into other chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and/or power generation.  Several options are available to IOCL to complete this process, which can be integrated directly into its refinery operations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $744,675 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>NAICS CODE: 541712</p>
<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: SPECIAL SIGNALS/SIGINT COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND EXPLOITATION</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-2014-0010</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The objective of the effort under this Master BAA is to create new processing capabilities and new signals exploitation technologies. The focus of this effort will support the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission, protect blue coalition forces with command, control, computer and intelligence applications, and support battlespace awareness for the warfighter.</p>
<p>In the area of ISR information extraction for Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) issues, new and innovative methods and processing techniques will provide decision-makers with ISR information in near real-time. This effort will focus on new technologies to process current and new Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), communications related targets. Software Defined Radio development will be heavily leveraged to promote modularity in distribution of the newly developed capabilities. New algorithmic techniques will be leveraged as well as new more powerful software and firmware technologies. SIGINT technologies process information on various communications mediums, operate in environments in low signal-to-noise ratio areas and conduct operations against uncooperative targets where the noise types and channel conditions are frequently varying from message to message. As time is critical and ISR mission analysts' workload is high, new automation capabilities will be developed in this effort, and processing will be formulated to enable junior collection operators a simpler approach to gathering intelligence. Automation in modulation identification, internal data structures and overall automated classification will be developed to stream-line the exploitation and in the end, complete overall autonomous operation.</p>
<p>The SIGINT research and development is grouped into three broad technology areas: Information Extraction, Signal Processing, and Automation Enhancements. The first, Information Extraction, extracts information from the broadband signal to identify and catalog Signals of Interest (SOI). The second area, Signal Processing, processes the signal to improve signal processor performance for the above information extraction capabilities. This represents research in removing noise and interference in a channel or in multiple channels from signals. The third broad area, Automation Enhancements, uses signal processing techniques to automate the manual techniques that are current practice. This automation may be used to manipulate the SOI for storage and transmission or to synthesize the signal for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately <strong>$49.9M</strong>. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:</p>
<p><strong>FY15 - $7.5M<br />FY16 - $7.5M<br />FY 17 - $13.5M<br />FY18 - $14.9M<br />FY19 - $6.5M</strong></p>
<p>Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $250,000 to $3,000,000 per year. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds. All potential Offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>

<p>e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have an <strong>government approved</strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the real-time SIGINT collection, processing and exploitation technology. White papers/proposals should document the potential quantifiable benefits in terms of increased efficiency of automated data processing, increased capabilities of interactive data processing tools, and increased capabilities to exploit machine-to-machine information.</p>
<p>b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge.</p>
<p>c. Application and Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and how well it applies to signals intelligence.</p>
<p>d. Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and fees (if any)</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p>VI. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span></strong> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TS/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>
<p>b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br />a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />b. FAPISS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />(a) FAR 52.209-07, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />(b) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />(c) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation <br />(d) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />(e) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>

<DESC><p><br />UPDATE 03 NOVEMBER 2016</p>
<p>This is a special notice regarding this solicitation and is not intended to be a continuation of the previously posted Pre-Solicitation Notice.</p>
<p>This notice is to inform the public that Solicitation Number W9124J-16-R-0020 was replaced by W9124D-16-R-0046 for the U.S. Army Advertising and Marketing Program requirement. Interested parties can search the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) with the new solicitation number.</p>
<p>Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FBO website for any future announcements, notices, and solicitation information issued under the new solicitation number, W9124D-16-R-0046.</p>
<p>Nothing else follows this announcement. Please proceed to announcement number W9124D-16-R-0046 for important updates regarding this requirement.</p>
<p><br />UDPATE END<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />W9124J-16-R-0020 Amendment 1 to Pre-Solicitation Notice/Multi-Step Advisory Process</p>
<p>This notice is issued pursuant to FAR 15.202, Advisory Multi-Step Process and FAR 5.204, Pre-solicitation Notices. This notice contains a description of the requirement and instructions on how companies should respond. This notice is not the actual solicitation, but is for the purpose of identifying interested Agencies and to advise on their potential viability as competitors prior to soliciting proposals. This notice also acts as the Pre-solicitation Notice in advance of the solicitation being released. This notice does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government, and does not guarantee that an actual solicitation or a contract will be issued.</p>
<p>1. Overview</p>
<p>1.1 The MICC-FSH has a requirement for a full-service advertising agency to support a nationwide advertisement campaign for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs (ASA (M&amp;RA)); the Army Marketing and Research Group (AMRG); and the Office of the Chief, Army Reserve.</p>
<p>1.2 This requirement is to provide the Army with the capability and services of a full-service advertising agency (herein referred to as "Agency") to provide a nationwide advertisement campaign program for personnel recruitment and retention programs throughout the Army. Similar to many other services the Army procures, the selected Agency will provide professional expertise and services. However, unlike any other service the Army procures, the Agency is required to develop and execute successful national and local marketing communication efforts in support of the development of a vibrant marketing and advertising strategy and subsequent marketing plans required to transform the mindset of the target audiences. The strategies and marketing plans encompass the enlisted and officer manpower requirement of the Active Army, Army Reserve, and the Army Civilian workforce. In addition, campaigns may be required for influencer and ethnic markets.</p>
<p>1.3 The Agency is also required to provide a full range of services to include, assisting the development of the Army's marketing strategy, the execution of the tactical advertising strategy through the production of a wide range of advertising solutions.</p>
<p>1.4 This is a performance based requirement that not only provides the above described services but also complete advertising planning and tactical services. These include: development and production of creative; planning and purchasing of media; strategic planning/research; local marketing; event marketing; interactive marketing; promotions marketing; public relations; multi-cultural advertising; as well as online and social media.</p>
<p>1.5 The resultant contract is anticipated to be a Single Award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a potential of up to 10 years of performance.</p>
<p>2. Advisory Multi-Step Process</p>
<p>2.1 The Contracting Officer invites interested contractors to review the attached Advisory Phase Questionnaire, complete it, and return the questionnaire to: usarmy.jbsa.acc-micc.mbx.micc-fsh-amp@mail.mil. The deadline for responses is suspended indefinitely at this time. Do not send any responses until further notice. Any responses that are submitted will not be evaluated and will be returned.</p>
<p>2.2 MICC-Fort Sam Houston (MICC-FSH) will advise Agencies responding to the Advisory Phase Questionnaire if they are considered viable competitors or if they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. If a company is determined not to be a viable competitor, they are NOT precluded from submitting a proposal once the actual solicitation is issued.</p>
<p>2.3 Limit responses to only what is requested in the Advisory Phase Questionnaire.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes. Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolks intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide administrative, technical and customer service support with the ability of data entry, inventory management, organizational maintenance checks and general ADP trouble ticket processing as defined in the attached draft Performance Work Statement. This announcement constitutes a sources sought for written information only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and a contract will not be awarded from this announcement.
 This announcement is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.

Anticipated NAICS Code
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 518210- Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services and the Size Standard is $32.5 million. Respondents should provide their business size for this NAICS Code. The Government has not yet determined whether an existing strategically sourced vehicle will be used to satisfy this requirement. 

Reponses to this Sources Sought request should reference N00189-17-R-0008 and shall include the following information in this format: 

1. Company name, address, point of contact name, phone number, fax number and email address.
 

2. Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.

3. If the services can be solicited from a GSA schedule, provide the GSA contract number.

4. If the services can be solicited from SeaPort, provide the contract number.

5. Size of business - Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantage, 8(a), Hubzone, Woman-owned and/or Service Disabled Veteran-owned.

 Please also include in past performance information the contract numbers, dollar value, and period of performance for each contract referenced in the response to this sources sought.

9. The Government is still determining the acquisition strategy and if this acquisition will be a small business set-aside, then FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies. Note that if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small businesses, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR clause 52.219-14.

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.
 Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.

10. Include any other supporting documentation.

11. Comments or suggested changes to the Governments NAICS Determination.

12. Identify conditions or issues the U.S. Government should consider or may interfere with the intention of this project.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed five (5) typewritten pages in no less than 12 font size.
 

Responses should be emailed to Addison Page at addison.page@navy.mil by 0900 EST on 11/08/16. Again, this is not a request for a proposal. Respondents will not be notified of the results.

<DESC>This is a PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE only. This is not a request for proposal.
<p>General Contractor for Construction Services for the Facility-wide Modernization and Expansion of the U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York.</p>
<p>Reference may be made to FBO Sources Sought Notice No. GS-02-P-16-DT-C-ABLPOE, posted on June 13, 2016.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS) Northeast and Caribbean Region (Region 2) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a qualified General Contractor to provide construction services for the modernization of the U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York.</p>
<p>This requirement will be Full and Open Competition  in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code associated with this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; with a size standard of thirty-six million, five hundred thousand dollars ($36,500,000) average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This will be a competitively negotiated acquisition governed by procedures in FAR 15. Source selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process. A firm fixed price contract is contemplated.</p>
<p>GSA anticipates issuing the Request for Proposal (RFP) approximately on or about November 18, 2016; with receipt of proposals at a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days later. All information, amendments and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted at the FedBizOpps website via http://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is expected to be 1737 calendar days.</p>
<p>The Estimated Construction Cost for this project is between the range of $180,000,000 and $195,000,000.</p>
<p>The facility U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York is located at 46735 Interstate 81, Alexandria Bay, New York.</p>
<p>The Alexandria Bay Land Port of Entry (LPOE), also known as the Thousand Island Border Station, is located on Wellesley Island, New York, in the western straits of the St. Lawrence River. This LPOE is served by I-81, a major highway heavily  traveled by both commercial and non-commercial travel. From Canada, the highway provides direct access to major cities and distribution centers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic US. The existing LPOE consists of four primary buildings constructed in 1969 and contains 52,261 usable square feet of office and inspection space. The mission of the Port of Entry is to inspect and process vehicles and individuals entering the United States from Canada. This mission is primarily carried out by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service - Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS), and The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The General Services Administration (GSA) owns, operates, and maintains the facility.</p>
<p>In 2006, more than 676,000 passenger vehicles and 213,000 commercial vehicles utilized the Alexandria Bay POE. This station is the 6th busiest crossing for "U.S. Bound" commercial vehicles on the U.S. - Canadian border. The existing facility has an inadequate number of commercial vehicle inspection lanes, resulting in traffic congestion and delays. There is also an insufficient amount of queuing space for the traffic that passes through the LPOE.</p>
<p>The current facility no longer meets the needs of the federal inspection agencies which operate within the port of entry. The agencies are facing higher traffic volume and are required to perform more and different inspections that the original port was designed to address. This project seeks to address these problems and allow greater flexibility to the agencies changing needs.</p>
<p>The offeror selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. Construction elements may include but are not limited to building construction services, fire protection, lighting, mechanical and electrical upgrades, and asbestos abatement.</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held for the procurement. The date and time will be posted on FedBizOpps (estimated date is on November 29, 2016). The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the project and proposal requirements.</p>
<p>Interested firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), in order to receive a contract award. Firms can register via the Internet site at https://www.sam.gov or by contacting SAM Service Desk at http://www.fsd.gov.</p>
<p>The solicitation and associated information will be available from the FedBizOpps website mentioned above. No telephone requests will be accepted. The solicitation will not be a sealed bid and there will not be a formal bid opening. All inquiries must be in writing, via email to the person(s) specified in the solicitation. All answers will be provided in writing and will be available on the aforementioned FedBizOpps posting. Offeror's will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses.</p>
<p>The solicitation documents will be posted as "secure" packages in the FedBizOpps posting.  In order to view or download the packages, vendors must have a secure account.  Information on how to register for an account and log in is available on the fbo.gov website, under the "Getting Started" tab.</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO THIS NOTICE TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF ACTIONS INCLUDING POSTING OF ANY AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER, OFFERORS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THE SITE FREQUENTLY AS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AMENDMENTS.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: The official solicitation package and technical specifications will be located on the official government web page and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source. Amendments, if/when issued will be posted to the FedBizOpps site for electronic downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation. Websites are occasionally inaccessible due to various reasons. The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the documents posted on the referenced web pages. The Government will not issue paper copies.</p>

<DESC>3 Nov 16:&nbsp; An amendment will be issued later today to extend the proposal due date to 30 Nov 16:kam<br /><br /><br />31 May 16:&nbsp; This notice is to extend the proposal due date to 15 June 2016.<br /><br />29 Apr 16: This notice is to post the solicitation for Region 3.<br /><br /><br />This is a pre-solicitation notice for an acquisition to proceed as a 100% set aside for small business concerns. The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 15 Apr 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS</p>
<p>Ordering Solicitation:</p>
<p>Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued. To register, click on the Register Now button in the Vendors Block and follow the instructions. For further information, please click on the FedBizOpps homepage link and the Vendor User Guide.</p>
<p>The only PLAN-HOLDER'S/BIDDER'S LIST now available is via FedBizOpps. When viewing the Synopsis/Pre- solicitation Notice, you will click on the &lsquo;ADD ME TO INTERESTED VENDORS' to enter your information. This function does not, however, allow you to identify yourself as a Prime or Sub. It is recommended that you identify your category in parentheses at either the beginning or end of your company name. For example: XYZ Construction (Prime/Sub). IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO CHECK FEDBIZOPPS FREQUENTLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES TO THE SOLICITATION.</p>

<DESC>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />Cable TV Subscription for FDA/CFSAN College Park, MD Buildings*<br />1<br />This document contains proprietary or procurement sensitive information related to the conduct of a federal agency procurement and shall not be disclosed to any person other than a person authorized by the contracting officer to receive such information.<br />1. Agency: Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Health and Human Services<br />&bull; a. Program Office/Center/Mail Code: FDA/CFSAN/OM HFS-676<br />&bull; b. Project Officer/Address/Telephone Number:<br />Christine Keys/5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740/240-402-2247<br />&bull; c. Contracting Activity: Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services
<p>2. Nature of Action Being Proposed for Approval:<br />New contract to establish cable services for CPK1 and CPK2, consisting of a three month base and a 12-month option period.</p>
<p>3. Title and Description of Supplies or Services and Estimated Value:</p>
<p>&bull; a. Project Title: Cable TV Subscription for FDA/CFSAN College Park, MD Buildings<br />&bull; b. Contract/Order No. Requisition number: 1175085<br />&bull; c. Description of supplies or services: Cable TV Services<br />&bull; d. Estimated Dollar Value: $37,000</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority:<br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), soliciting from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, only one source is reasonably available.</p>
<p><br />5. Contractor's Unique Qualifications to Provide the Services or Supplies and/or Why The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited.<br />Previous contracts for cable services have been provided by Comcast. Should this requirement be competed and awarded to a new vendor utilizing a different technology to distribute the signal, current infrastructure could not be utilized, and the vendor would need to install the required infrastructure to support their services in order to meet the level of performance and service currently being received. The new vendor may need to reinstall all of existing cable drops and set up for the initial installation. If the new vendor has to develop a new infrastructure and cable drops it should meet CFSAN starting service date of November 1, 2016. Satellite services can't be provided without infrastructure approval from the General Service Administration (GSA). Therefore, due to the November 1 deadline for service and additional GSA approval requirements, it is not feasible to seek competition for this requirement.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers Are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources As Practicable.<br />FDA posted a Notice of Intent to Sole Source on October 11, 2016, which closed on October 24, 2016. Only one response was received. The response was evaluated, and the program office determined that response would not meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.<br />Prior to award of a purchase order, the Contracting Officer will determine the price to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. Sources that have Expressed Interest in the Acquisition in Writing.<br />See response to section 6.</p>
<p>9. Provide a statement that indicates that the use of the Justification for procuring this supply or service is not a result of a lack of planning or the expiration of funds.<br />The use of this justification is not the result of a lack of planning or the expiration of funds.</p>
<p><br />Contracting Officer Certification:<br />I certify that this submission is accurate and contains complete data necessary to support the recommendations for approval. The contracting officer further certifies that an award of this contract action from this requirement will be made only if the price or cost to the Government is determined to be fair and reasonable.<br />__________________________________________________<br />Contracting Officer Date</p>
