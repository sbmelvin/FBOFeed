<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solication.     The General Services Administration intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Webbe Inc. located in Alpharetta, Georgia.     The purpose of this procurement is upgrade WEBBE Instant Messaging Tool Software Server/Client to support of Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE) Mission Support Centers’ Warfighter Support.   Webbe Inc. was determined to specifically address the unique requirements being utilized by Special Operations Mission Planning Environment.  Webbe Inc. is the only source for this requirement because of the limited rights and copyrights and is solely capable of responding to ongoing support requirements.   The WEBBE Instant Messaging Tool has currently been adopted by the SOMPE-M program and this interface is the only one that will work with the existing software architecture.  Any other software will add extra costs of an additional software interface and employee training to satisfy agency requirements.  There are other commercially available instant messaging tools, but do not afford the additionally capability of voice instant messaging and highly compressed audio for the Naval Special Warfare Commands’ Mission Planning Environment that have been tested thus far.  Failure to provide this single maintenance source will have a significant adverse effect on the program’s mission.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.     The applicable North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the size standard is $21.0 million.     All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience related to fulfilling a similar requirement via e-mail to diemle.phan@gsa.gov by 5:00 p.m., PST, April 28, 2004. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for life testing of thermo electric modules which are presently operating in a 5-place test station resulting from a previously awarded Department of Energy contract.	The requirement also includes the upgrade of the presently operating 5-place test station to incorporate improved cold side temperature control and installation of a LabVIEW automated PC-based data acquisition and control system, and the construction of a second, 6-place module test station.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service – Northern Region anticipates awarding up to two Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design-build architect-engineer (A-E) services. Any awarded contract shall be a Design/Build arrangement with the design professional as the primary contractor. The design professional (Architect or Engineer, or Architect-Engineer) shall be responsible to the Forest Service for all design and construction. 

Subcontractors performing specific design and construction services must be responsible to the design professional.  For this acquisition the design professional is defined as any of the following: Professional Engineer, or Architect, or a Architect-Engineer, or a teaming arrangement where the Professional Engineer or Architect or Architect-Engineer is the lead team member/firm. 

CONTRACTOR SELECTION PROCESS.  In accordance with the FAR Part 36.602 and following an evaluation of the submitted qualification and performance data,  the Forest Service will choose at least three firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required. Then the Forest Service will begin negotiations with the most preferred firm of the three selected and continue until the FS negotiates contracts with up to two firms. However, the government reserves the right to award zero contracts if all negotiations are unsuccessful.  

CONTRACT. Each awarded contract will consist of one base year with options to extend the contract for four additional one-year periods. The government reserves the right not to extend the contract for any option period.

The guaranteed contract minimum dollars shall be $30,000 per year, per contract, with a maximum not-to-exceed 5-year total for each contract of $7.5 Million over the life of the contract.  If an option to extend the contract is not exercised by the Forest Service, the guaranteed minimum shall stop and the contract will be considered complete with no future guaranteed amount due that contractor.  If the Agency receives additional funds for future specifically designated programs and thereby the Forest Service funding levels significantly increase within the contract period, the Forest Service may increase the maximum not-to-exceed amount to a mutually negotiated maximum not-to-exceed amount. The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330.  The associated small business size standard for this acquisition is up to $4.0 million in average annual receipts. Businesses with annual receipts below that size are considered small businesses for this acquisition. This acquisition is considered full and open competition.  

TASK ORDER SELECTION CONSIDERATIONS. This announcement does not guarantee any work to the contracted firms. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated Task Orders awarded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the negotiated contract. Task Orders may be awarded under the resulting contracts as Firm Fixed or Time and Materials pricing arrangements. As determined appropriate by the Forest Service, Task Orders may be for design and build/construction, or design only, but none will be construction only. The Forest Service will make the decision to award any task orders by considering all firms of concurrent contracts. The selection of a contractor for a particular Task Order will be based on a unilateral assessment by the Government of any or all of the following unranked issues: 
a. Equitable allocation of work among contracts; 
b. Specific and unique capabilities; 
c. Apparent capacity of the contractor to perform the anticipated type of work; 
d. Timeliness and historical work performance; 
e. Required delivery schedule; 
f. Experience and/or ongoing work (locality and/or type); 
g. Understanding of local factors and geography; 
h. Remaining contract capacity; 
i. Availability of personnel; 
j. Risk Management arrangements.

If at any time the contractor fails to provide a quality product at a reasonable price and on schedule, the contractor may not receive additional task orders under this contract, future option years may not be exercised, and the minimum guarantee may be reduced for that or any future year.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

All responses to this Special Notice must make reference to Number FA2816-04-T-0002 and be submitted by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on 26 April 2004. The document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09. The North American Industry Classification is 541511. The size standard is $21 million. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating is: UNRATED.

Provide user and administrator training for internally developed relational database management system formerly known as HIDE.  With the recent developments and modifications to the HIDE system, two separate databases have been created, RM Central and CM Central.  This Statement of Work will encompass both systems, RM Central and CM Central for the above stated requirements. This database management system was custom developed by Defense Office of Joint Program Requirement (DOJPR) and Datasphere LLC.  Datasphere LLC owns the rights to the intellectual property of the program code.  Although DOJPR has distribution and licensing rights to RM Central and CM Central, they do not have access to the source code for this database.  Therefore, only Datasphere LLC can perform required maintenance, optimization and support for the system.  Upon approval and acceptance of this contract, DOJPR shall appoint a contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR).  The Contracting Officer and/or COTR shall be the vendor’s sole point of contact at DOJPR for the purposes of this contract.  The vendor acknowledges that he or she shall accept tasks and work assignments only from a Contracting Officer and COTR.  No other DOJPR personnel, staff or employee shall have the authority to direct, propose or direct maintenance, support or other services from the vendor.  Requests from DOJPR members other than a duly appointed Contracting Officer and COTR shall not be construed by the vendor as authority or requirement to perform additional work or services. Services are to be performed at DOJPR’s El Segundo location, but may also be required or performed at other DOJPR offices at the discretion of and with the approval of the COTR.  This contract does not authorize or fund any additional hours performed outside of the DOJPR’s offices. The contract does not authorize or fund per diem or travel expenses incurred by the vendor.  The vendor assumes all responsibility and shall make no claim for travel costs and per diem under this contract.  Payments under this contract shall be limited exclusively to actual time spent by the vendor on site at DOJPR performing maintenance, optimization, support and training services specified in this contract.  Payments for hourly services performed by the vendor shall be paid on a monthly basis once invoiced by the vendor and certified by the Contracting Officer and COTR.  No payment for services shall be authorized without such Contracting Officer and COTR certification and verification.  DOJPR’s COTR shall provide a separate task list (included with the Statement of Work) to the vendor upon acceptance of this contract.  The list shall be classified SECRET.  This is a maintenance contract only and shall not provide for the development of additional features of components for the system.  Tasks shall belong to one or more of the following categories of services and support required by DOJPR under this contract: (a) Maintenance – Maintain, repair and adjust existing code, tables, components, forms, reports, queries and relations of RM Central and CM Central per the approval of the COTR. (b) Optimization– Make such changes as are necessary to RM Central and CM Central components (i.e., codes, tables, relations, etc.) to optimize the system for stability, data integrity and usability per the approval of the COTR.  (c) Support of RM Central and CM Central – Provide technical support as required to DOJPR users of RM Central and CM Central responsible for administration and operation of the databases.  (d) Training – Provide training in the use of operation of the system.  Assist DOJPR users of RM Central and CM Central systems in developing additional training and procedures for the use, operation and administration of the system.  Because the actual RM Central and CM Central systems and the data contained are classified SECRET, the vendor must possess at least a SECRET security clearance.  The vendor shall not copy or remove any classified material from any of DOJPR’s facilities without the express written permission of the Chief of DOJPR or the unit security manager.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Wireless Headset System
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-WirelessHeadsets--FAD
<RESPDATE>052104
<ARCHDATE>06052004
<CONTACT>Cynthia Doster, Contract Specialist, Phone (912) 267-2886, Fax (912) 267-3132, Email Cynthia.Doster@dhs.gov
<DESC>This is an extension of the RFI with clarifications.  This is not a set-aside of any kind.  The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) requests information and comments from manufacturers and other interested parties concerning the availability of wireless communications headsets (one-piece radio/headset combination) specifically designed for use within firearms training ranges.  The radio/headset must be an all-in-one solution that does not require the headset to be connected to a separate radio unit.  The objective of this request is to obtain information concerning equipment availability, specific frequency band compatibility, power output, coverage area, voice activated transmission, cost, noise dampening, battery technology, user controls, headset LCD screens, maintenance, and service support.  Background:  The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, headquartered in Glynco, GA covers an area of 1500 acres and borders Brunswick, GA to the east and St. Simons Island to the north.  FLETC provides a wide variety of law enforcement training for over 70 federal agencies throughout the United States.  A large majority of students are trained in the use of firearms using one of 14 ranges on the Glynco campus as well as a number of ranges located on the Charleston, SC, Cheltenham, MD, and Artesia, NM campuses.   FLETC utilizes both indoor and outdoor firing ranges. Typical indoor ranges consist of concrete floors, concrete wall structures, a bulletproof glass control center, and partitioned ceiling sections partially open to the sky or fully enclosed with metal ceilings and acoustic dampening material. The outdoor ranges are fully exposed to all the climatic elements. The ranges operate independently and require wireless communications localized to each range facility.   Currently, the FLETC uses a headset with boom microphone that is connected to a Motorola radio on federally licensed frequencies.  The FLETC is interested in wireless headset/radio combination for each instructor to enhance the current methods of communications. The combination headset/radio must operate using licensed US Government VHF, UHF frequency bands.  The headsets are expected to improve instructor communications among one another in administering classes, in grading students, and in halting the firing of weapons in the event of an emergency. Additionally, a desk module is required for use within the soundproof control tower allowing other audible communications devices to be heard within the same room.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) for commercial and/or non-commercial headsets that can meet the specific needs of the FLETC.  Respondents shall provide the following information:  (1)  Indicate a wireless headset system specifically associated with noise dampening technologies and standards; (2) Identify and provide technical specifications for products currently available that either operate across licensed U.S. Government VHF, UHF frequency bands (roughly 162-174VHF and 406-420UHF), and/or use unlicensed frequencies if voice privacy is available. If active product development activities are underway, identify these products and indicate where and when they will be available and first deployed; (3)  Indicate the proposed headset transmission technologies necessary to function in a large indoor area with 5 to 10 instructors. Radio coverage must be able to support indoor areas in excess of 100 yards in length. Neighboring ranges operate simultaneously, so multiple channels must also be available to avoid interference:  (4)  Indicate the proposed headset voice encoding technologies necessary to function in an area with high levels of background noise (firearms);  (5)  Indicate the availability of a cutoff switch for the microphone if an instructor wishes to remain off the air; (6)  Hands free operation, keeping any and all wires or cords to a minimum;  (7)  Voice-activated capable; (8)  Indicate the availability of weatherproofing for outdoor use in extreme conditions; (9)  Indicate availability of a desktop transceiver in the control center and how it will function with the proposed headset system; (10)  Provide detailed information on chargers, interchangeable battery clips, other accessories (e.g., antennas, replacement batteries, adjustable arm microphones, throat microphones, etc.) and thoughts on the effectiveness of various solutions; (11)  Identify any experience with providing these systems in a law enforcement firearms training environment (i.e., previous installations or product development); (12)  Provide list price rough-order-magnitude pricing including price adjustments for step sizes of orders; (13)  Provide typical repair and warranty information available for these units;  (14)  Identify any unique features that may add to the effectiveness of communicating within a firing range not specifically mentioned in this document.  All submissions will become the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Any company “proprietary” or “confidential” information should be annotated as such.  Do not submit samples; FLETC will not guarantee the return of any samples provided, nor will FLETC pay for any samples provided and not returned.  Information should be provided to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Procurement, Bldg 93 (C. Doster), 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, Brunswick (Glynco), GA  31524.  Packages should be clearly marked as “Wireless Headset System Information” and be presented in such a manner as to ensure that the materials remain together securely to avoid separation of information during reviews.  Questions regarding technical information must be referred in writing to cynthia.doster@dhs.gov.  Verbal requests for technical information will not be accepted.

<SOLNBR>SP0200-04-R-5006
<CONTACT>Eileen Motta, Contract Specialist, Phone 215-737-7243, Fax 215-737-8139, Email Eileen.Motta@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a long-term Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with Abbott Laboratories to support the worldwide demand for Abbott Immunoassay, Hematology, I-STAT and Medisense Diagnostic Reagents.  Through Market Research it has been determined that Abbott diagnostic reagents are specifically configured to support Abbott’s testing systems employed at the Military Treatment Facilities. No other manufacturer or distributors sells or has access to these products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.  It has been determined that there is only one known manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories, who has the capability of providing the required items.
This solicitation will require Abbott to submit a catalog detailing all of the diagnostic reagents for each Military Treatment Facility serviced.  All prices for Immunoassay and Hematology reagents must be developed based on the Cost-Per-Test pricing methodology.   Abbott will be asked to provide tables detailing the reagents, add-on options and any additional discounts.  The prices in these tables will be firm-fixed for the duration of the contract.  Abbott, will be required to supply all supporting price documentation needed to perform the Cost-Per-Test calculation and a catalog with an inclusive price for each Military Treatment Facility serviced.  The price for Hematology and Immunoassay reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who did not meet the previous years annual committed usage volume or who have a change in the amount of equipment or service hours currently rendered.  All increases in catalog prices charged to each customer will be recalculated using the firm-fixed price tables and the Cost-Per-Test pricing calculation outlined in the Abbott Federal Supply Schedule.  A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.

I-STAT reagents are purchased based on quantity tier pricing.  Any customers whose usage falls within one of these quantity tiers will receive the same price for that reagent.  Under this solicitation Abbott will be required to provide a table detailing the I-STAT product line and the tier pricing offered.  They will also be required to submit usage data and a total ECAT price for each customer.  The pricing tables should support the price charged to each customer.  These tables will not be subject to adjustment and shall be firm-fixed for the entire duration of the contract, unless something becomes obsolete and a replacement item is added. The price for I-STAT reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who have a change in their annual committed usage volume.   A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.   
For the Medisense items the contractor shall submit an ECAT price for each facility serviced as part of their catalog.  These prices are firm fixed and are not subject to price adjustments during the life of this contract.
This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Initially, manufacturer’s will be asked to supply Continental United States (CONUS) catalog, which includes facilities located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii and will be implemented first.  The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States and will be required in the future under this solicitation.  The prices submitted by Abbott for each Military Treatment Facility serviced will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.
All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication option available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standard and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Abbott Laboratories must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options. They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.
The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $12.5 million dollars over the total contract period.  Solicitation SP0200-04-R-5006 is expected to become available May 31,2004 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home .

<SOLNBR>W15QKN-04-X-0815
<RESPDATE>042904
<CONTACT>Josh Minorics, Contract Specialist, (973)724-4165
<DESC>The U.S. Government is seeking information on potential candidates for immediate procurement or rapid development of a Multi-Target (MT) Round for the  U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti- Personnel  Weapon System (MAAWS). The current MAAWS program is the Non- Developmental Item  (NDI) acquisition of the Saab Bofors Dynamics Carl Gustaf 84mm recoilless rifle  system. The U.S. Government does not own data rights to the system. USSOCOM has  a requirement for a MAAWS round that will incapacitate personnel protected in  the line-of-sight of the projectile detonation inside of man-made or natural  protective structures/confined spaces.  The MT round must be capable of  defeating urban structures constructed using eight inch reinforced concrete or 12 inch triple brick walls where no openings exist.  It is also desired that  the round match the flight trajectory of a fielded MAAWS round.  The MT round  fuzing must meet U.S. safe and arming device requirements. The fuze must  function in a delay mode. Minimum fuze arming distance must be 20 meters, with  15 meters desired; it is also desired that the round reach safe separation  distance prior to reaching the minimum arming distance.  The total weight of  the complete MT cartridge and projectile must not exceed 10 pounds. The rounds  must be completely compatible with the Saab Bofors Dynamics 84mm M3 Carl Gustaf  recoilless rifle. Because the Government does not own data rights to the  weapon, potential offerors must request required weapon data from Saab Bofors  Dynamics, Karlskoga, Sweden. The round must be capable of being rigged for  airborne and submersible operations in accordance with existing service  procedures. The round must be sufficiently rugged to remain safe, operational  and effective following exposure to the rigors normally associated with  military operations, including air delivery and salt water submersion. A fully  developed round is desired, development effort not to exceed 24 months to  delivery of production configuration is acceptable. Contractor/Government/Other  Foreign Government Agencies teaming to streamline the effort perform concurrent  test and evaluation will be utilized. The round must meet U.S. safety and  performance requirements. In response to this survey, information shall be  provided on the following areas and topics. Additional information and topics  are also encouraged. All responses to this survey must be in the English  language. Item Status: Information shall be provided that shows item production  status or how the item will be developed. It shall include information on the  design, fabrication and tests conducted or to be conducted to validate the  design. Compatibility with the Bofors M3 Carl Gustaf system must be  specifically addressed. Cost/Schedule: Actual or expected production unit costs  for the MT round shall be provided. If development is required, projections of  development costs for the MT from start of work to delivery of approximately  400 production representative end items for U.S. Government qualification,  along with supporting safety, performance and design data shall be provided.  The time required to deliver the test items and data for the round shall also  be provided. Safety Program: Information shall be provided on existing system  safety engineering capability and experience in meeting U.S. Army, Navy and Air  Force health and safety requirements. Industrial Preparedness: Information  shall be provided on round availability, including a summary of facilities and  tooling available to support development and production. Production history for  recoilless rifle systems or munitions shall be submitted to demonstrate past  performance, with emphasis on work performed for the U.S. Government.  Acquisition Teaming: Information shall be provided describing experience in  teaming with a customer, to include level of involvement with emphasis on  participation in U.S. Government defense acquisition teams.

Estimating Wildlife Response to the Conservation Reserve Program

GENERAL

C.1.1 Background – (Introduction)
The objective of the project is to produce estimates of population response by key wildlife species, or species groups, to land use changes associated with implementation of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).  The project will provide a methodology the Farm Service Agency (FSA) can use to annually generate estimates of CRP effects on selected wildlife species populations. Species populations of greatest interest are upland -nesting waterfowl, ring-necked pheasant, northern bobwhite, and prairie grouse.  Including non-game-grassland bird population effects in association with these species would increase the competitiveness of an offer.

Under the CRP, environmentally sensitive cropland is being retired to conserving uses such as introduced and native grasses, trees, restored wetlands, riparian buffers, and grass filters.  These covers provide multiple benefits including the creation of habitats for a wide set of wildlife species.  Due to difficulties and costs of monitoring, documentation of program effects on wildlife species populations generally have been geographically isolated. Results from relatively small or disjunct studies, however, imply significant benefits to wildlife are being realized from enrolling land in the CRP. Results of completed studies have typically not been extrapolated to furnish estimates of population response on larger regional scales. 

The FSA is required by statute to consider enhancement of wildlife habitat when selecting CRP offers.  To date, the performance measure used to assess wildlife response to the CRP has been the number of acres in various practices considered most beneficial to wildlife. This approach furnishes only an indirect measure of animal response based on the assumption that wildlife responds favorably to beneficial changes in the quality and distribution of habitat.  A better measure of CRP wildlife benefits are estimates related to changes in wildlife populations. Examples of wildlife response to changes in habitat may be reflected by, but are not limited to, changes in density (#s/area) or alteration of nest success and survival rates.  In order to refine CRP performance measures required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), FSA needs to assess the response of prominent wildlife species populations to establishment of CRP habitats.

C.1.2 Objectives

The contractor(s) is expected to produce an estimate of the response of selected wildlife species and/or species groups to land use changes and habitat development associated with CRP implementation. The project also will provide a method by which FSA can annually generate estimates of CRP effects on selected wildlife species.  These annual estimates will be used to meet the GPRA requirements that programs set measurable goals and measure progress in meeting those goals.  Further, results will be used for communication with decision and policy-makers concerning CRP benefits and refinement of program priorities.

The contractor(s) will be expected to use existing wildlife, land use, and program data to develop estimates of changes in wildlife populations associated with implementation of the CRP.   Examples of data identified as available and potentially useful include the USDA National Resources Inventory (NRI), the USGS Breeding Birding Survey (BBS), CRP contract data, Department of Interior Waterfowl Surveys, and State game records. Initiation of new field studies is beyond the scope of this project.

C.1.3 Scope of Work 

CRP contract data, natural resource databases, and existing local, regional, and national data on key wildlife populations will be examined to determine the effect of the CRP on select wildlife populations. The accepted proposal(s) will consolidate significant findings from the scientific literature or ongoing or completed studies. Contractor(s) will be expected to develop and apply landscape models and other tools to determine wildlife population responses to different CRP conservation practices.  

The final product will include a model or an integrated set of models furnishing estimates of CRP effects on wildlife populations using currently available data.  

The CRP is national in scope, but the program’s impacts on wildlife populations are often regional or local. Species and species groups of special interest are upland-nesting waterfowl (e.g., mallard, gadwald, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, and northern shoveler), ring-necked pheasants, northern bobwhite, prairie grouse, and non-game grassland birds. Where regional assessments are proposed, regions will be defined by using aggregates of NRCS Land Resource Regions: Prairie Pothole, Northeast, South, Cornbelt, Great Plains, and Western States (see attached Map 1). 

The timeframe for the project is one year from the signing of the contract.  Proposals will provide dates when preliminary estimates of wildlife population response(s) will be available.  If multiple contractors are selected to address separate species or regions, these contractors will coordinate with one another to provide consistent, comparable methodologies.

C.1.4 Quality Assurance

The contractor will document model development, use of data, and statistical results. FSA will be able to replicate results from the model provided and data used. 

Data collection, aggregation, and analysis will follow accepted statistical and analytical methods.

The report will be clear and concise, fully documenting and supporting the use of the model and the model results.

C.2 Definitions

Region: Defined as shown in attached Map1.

C.3 Requirements/Tasks

Contractor(s) will estimate population response of special interest wildlife species or species groups to land use changes and habitat development associated with implementation of the CRP.  The estimates must include a measure of statistical reliability.  A comprehensive description of the data and methods used is required. The description will permit FSA to subsequently estimate CRP effects on wildlife populations.

The project will make use of existing resources such as the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data, FSA CRP contract data, USDA National Resources Inventory (NRI) data, waterfowl production survey records, state wildlife agency information, other data sources, and research findings to estimate the effect of converting cropland and marginal pasture to long-term conservation cover.    

The contractor will document appropriate use of the wildlife population model(s) developed. Documentation will include the region covered, confidence intervals around the estimate, and the species covered.  Regional and conservation practices effects may be pooled when statistical analysis indicates this is appropriate.

For wildlife species or groups associated with wildlife species subject to the assessment, (i.e., species associated with species of special interest but for which few data exist that quantify their response to conservation programs), the contractor will describe species’ response to CRP habitat relative to the response of the species that are subject to quantitative assessment. (i.e. strongly positive, positive, neutral, negative, strongly negative).

C.3.2 Deliverables

The contractor will provide 10 paper copies and an electronic copy (in Microsoft Word XP) of the final report. Databases developed will be provided in Microsoft Excel or Access (XP version).

The report will include:

An estimate of the response of special interest wildlife species or groups to land use changes and habitat development associated with implementation of the CRP.

A model of the species response to CRP will be provided.  Multiple models will be provided when more than one species is included in the proposal. A description of the data and methods used. The results must be replicable to be accepted, and the process must permit FSA to estimate CRP effects on wildlife populations.

Documentation of the appropriate use of the wildlife population model(s) developed.  The documentation will include at a minimum the region covered, confidence intervals around the estimate, assumptions used to aggregate data or fill missing data values and the species covered.  

National and regional estimates of per acre CRP effects on wildlife populations for CRP conservation practices are required.  A discussion of climatic variation or other biotic/abiotic factors potentially influencing estimates of changes in wildlife populations will also be included.

For wildlife populations examined, but not quantified (i.e., species associated with species of special interest) a table of expected population relationships with the species of concern. (i.e., strongly positive, positive, neutral, negative, strongly negative) must be constructed.

Contractor will be expected to provide quarterly reports detailing data base development, model development, and providing preliminary results when available. Each report will identify any barriers to timely completion of project.

Delivery will be made to: TBD
	

C.3.3 Deliverable Schedule

The final report will be delivered no later than 12 months after the contract is signed. 

Progress reports will be made on a quarterly basis.

C.4 Government Furnished Property 

FSA will provide county level summaries of contract data including acres and age of annual CRP enrollments by conservation practice.  Conservation covers include introduced grasses, native grasses, softwood and hardwood trees, restored wetlands, riparian buffers, grass filters, and other CRP practices.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify academic, nonprofit, or commercial entities interested in and capable of taking over publication of the National Institute of Mental Health’s (NIMH’s) peer reviewed, scientific journal, Schizophrenia Bulletin.  NIMH will be ending its support of this publication by January 1, 2005, and wishes to transfer responsibility for the Bulletin to a new publisher on, or before that date.  This transfer will be effected through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NIMH and the new publisher.  NIMH will not reimburse transition costs incurred by the new publisher, nor will it cover production costs for the Bulletin after the transfer date.  NIMH does not expect, nor will it request compensation for transferring Schizophrenia Bulletin.  This Notice solicits applications that evidence the interest, capability, and vision of organizations interested in taking over Schizophrenia Bulletin.   NIMH will select a new publisher after it evaluates all applications, and negotiates with those organizations that appear most qualified to continue publishing the Bulletin.  NIMH will be available to work closely with the new publisher to ensure a smooth transition.

Background:
Schizophrenia Bulletin (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/researchfunding/schizbull.cfm) was published quarterly by NIMH, and began Volume 30 in 2004.  Its mission has been “to facilitate the dissemination and exchange of information about schizophrenia.”  As a US Government publication, the Bulletin had an American focus, but it had an extensive international readership, and published articles from around the world.  Scientific articles in Schizophrenia Bulletin included reports of original research, topical reviews, reports of workshops and meetings, and, in an “At Issue” section, novel hypotheses and opinions.  Submissions have been carefully peer reviewed.  Usually, two of the Bulletin’s four annual issues were on special themes, focusing on particular aspects of schizophrenia.  Theme issues were guest-edited by a leader in the field, who decided which areas to cover, selected researchers to write articles, arranged peer review of manuscripts, and oversaw revisions.  Topics for theme issues were proposed by interested investigators, or solicited by the Bulletin’s Editors and Editorial Board.  Schizophrenia Bulletin also published “First Person” accounts submitted by people with schizophrenia or their relatives about their experiences with the illness.  The front cover of every issue of the Bulletin displayed a work of art submitted by a person with schizophrenia. Since it was a Government publication, none of the material appearing in Schizophrenia Bulletin (except for the cover art) was copyrighted.

NIMH currently contracts with EEI Communications (http://www.eeicommunications.com) to handle all non-scientific, production work for Schizophrenia Bulletin.  EEI logged and tracked all manuscript submissions and revisions, then corresponded with authors and peer reviewers until a final accept/reject decision was made by the Editors.  EEI copy edited accepted manuscripts, including theme issue manuscripts.  EEI prepared each issue for printing after the Editor decided on a Table of Contents.  The Bulletin was printed and mailed to subscribers by the Government Printing Office (GPO).  The Superintendent of Documents handled subscriptions and renewals.  Domestic subscribers paid $28.00 (USD) for a one year subscription (4 issues), while a one year foreign subscription cost $39.20 (USD).  There was no provision for multi-year subscriptions or institutional subscriptions.  As of November, 2003, Schizophrenia Bulletin had 2353 subscribers.

Sources Sought:
NIMH does not request remuneration or expect compensation for transferring Schizophrenia Bulletin.   However, it hopes that the Bulletin under a new publisher will continue to be a significant resource for researchers, clinicians, patients and family members.  NIMH will give preference to a publisher that will be able to carry out the many tasks involved in publishing a peer reviewed scientific journal, and has the best plan for maintaining or improving Schizophrenia Bulletin’s reputation, credibility; accessibility, and value to the community of people interested in understanding and treating schizophrenia.  Organizations interested in taking over Schizophrenia Bulletin must submit an application to NIMH that addresses these requirements.  This application should include:

1.	Background information about the organization; including its experience with schizophrenia, psychiatry, neuroscience and biomedical research, peer review of manuscripts, as well as the editorial and production process for a scientific periodical.
2.	A business plan with proposed subscription rates, advertising policy and rates (if advertisements will be accepted), and plans (if any) for sponsorship by commercial and noncommercial entities (e.g., pharmaceutical firms or nonprofit foundations)
3.	A timeline and plan for transfer of responsibility that addresses how the new publisher will handle previously accepted but unpublished manuscripts.  The transfer must be completed, and the new publisher must take full charge by January 1, 2005.
4.	An editorial policy plan, discussing the future mix of articles, governance and any plan for making Schizophrenia Bulletin available on line.

Applications should not be longer than 10 single spaced pages, plus any appropriate sample materials (e.g., an existing journal published by the applicant organization, or a web site it administers).  A digital copy of the application in Microsoft Word® format, plus 10 printed copies (with sample materials) should be provided.  Interested organizations should notify NIMH as soon as possible of their intent to submit an application.  NIMH will accept applications through COB, Friday, June 4, 2004.  Inquiries, correspondence, and application materials should be sent to:

David Eskenazi
Chief, Contracts Management Branch, ORM
National Institute of Mental Health, NIH, DHHS
Room 8154, MSC 9661
6001 Executive Blvd.
(for US mail, use Bethesda, MD  20892-9661)
(for hand and overnight deliveries, use 6001 Executive Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852)

Ph:   (301) 443-2696
Fax: (301) 443-0501
Email: de5d@nih.gov

Applications will be evaluated by NIMH.  NIMH will negotiate with the most qualified organizations, and make a final decision by Monday, August 16 2004.  Once a new publisher is chosen and a transfer date agreed  upon, NIMH will notify the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and Thomson ISI® that it is transferring Schizophrenia Bulletin to a new publisher.

Transition Process:
Subscribers:  Due to government privacy regulations, GPO cannot provide a list of the Bulletin’s subscribers and addresses to NIMH.  However, NIMH can send a letter to subscribers through GPO, notifying them of the change in publisher and providing instructions for renewing subscriptions to the Bulletin.   NIMH also can print this letter in any remaining issues of the Bulletin.  The new publisher may begin enrolling subscribers once the MOU with NIMH is finalized, but new subscriptions may not begin until after transfer of the Bulletin is completed.

Content: NIMH has a large number of accepted manuscripts in press, with a much smaller number still in the peer review process.  The Bulletin has stopped accepting new submissions. NIMH wishes to ensure that all submissions that have gone through peer review and have been accepted will be published in Schizophrenia Bulletin.  NIMH plans to increase the size of the issues in 2004 (Volume 30, # 1 - 4) to accommodate all accepted, unpublished manuscripts. A new publisher may ask NIMH to reserve a certain number of “excess” manuscripts so that the new publisher will have content for its issues of the Bulletin.   However, the new publisher must agree that any manuscripts so reserved will be published NIMH cancelled several special theme issues, originally scheduled for 2005 or 2006, but the new publisher may elect to revive some or all of these.  A new publisher can take over the Bulletin before 2005 if it agrees to publish all accepted, in press manuscripts.  The new publisher must include a disclaimer in all future issues that the Bulletin is no longer published by NIMH and is not a Federal Government publication.

Digital content:  Digital versions of the Bulletin have been prepared by EEI for GPO since 1998, and NIMH intends to provide these to the new publisher for any Schizophrenia Bulletin website.

NIMH Assistance:  NIMH will permit the current Editors of the Schizophrenia Bulletin to work with a new publisher after January 1, 2005, to ensure a smooth transfer of responsibility.

<DESC>Navair Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to modify the current Device 19G4 and develop the Device 19G4A Desktop simulator. A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract is anticipated with an estimated 3 years of period of performance. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering services with size standard $4 million applies. The Device 19G4 is designated as the “Gas Turbine Propulsion Plant Trainer (GTPPT).” There is only one Device 19G4, Serial No. 001, installed at Surface Warfare Officer School Command (SWOSCOLCOM or SWOS), Newport, RI. It is a stand-alone unit that does not interface with other training systems.  There are no plans to procure additional Device 19G4 trainers at this time. Device 19G4 is a Machinery Control System (MCS) simulator for the USS Arleigh Burke (DDG&#64979;51) ship class.  The GTPPT provides training for Prospective Commanding Officers, Prospective Executive Officers, Department Heads, and Engineering Officers of the Watch students in gas turbine principles and practices, watch-keeping, and the operation of the MCS consoles.  Students, standing watches under instructor supervision, will carry out normal and casualty control plant operations. Device 19G4A will be a Machinery Control System (MCS) desktop simulator for the USS Arleigh Burke (DDG&#64979;51) ship class.  It will be developed from the Device 19G4 software after it is re-hosted to a Pentium based PC.  The task will transition the software to an Automated Electronic Classroom (AEC) environment with desktop PCs.  The DDG-51 MCS Desktop Simulator will be utilized either as a Stand-Alone Watch-station Trainer for individual instruction, as a Watch Team Trainer with two or more consoles being operated in an integrated mode, as Instructor Led Training where the instructor provides training to the entire class, or as an extension to the Generic Re-configurable Training System (GRTS) or Total Ship Training System (TSTS). There are total of six phases for this trainer upgrade. The purpose of this initial phase of tasking is to incorporate the required modifications to bring device 19G4 up to present day technology and correct known deficiencies in the trainer’s non-ship configuration deficiencies. The next phase is to incorporate the ship’s configuration changes to bring the trainer up to current DDG-51 Flight I configuration standards. The third phase is to develop the Device 19G4A, DDG-51 MCS Desktop Simulator, to the Flight I Standards. The fourth phase is to incorporate all the ship’s configuration changes to bring the 19G4 trainer up to current DDG-51 Flight IA configuration standards. The fifth phase is to bring the Device 19G4A, DDG-51 MCS Desktop Simulator, to the Flight IA, II and IIA Standards. The sixth phase of this effort is incorporate modifications to 19G4 by adding a Flight IIA Electric Plant Control Consoles (EPCC) and incorporating a separate Flight IIA Mode of operation for the entire trainer.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Quest Diagnostics, Inc., located at 1201 South Collegeville Road, Collegeville, PA 19426, for the Federal Occupational Health (FOH) on the basis of other than full and open competition.  The authority for this noncompetitive award is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a full-range of medical laboratory tests (comprehensive blood and urine tests) to one of the FOH Service Provision Sites (SPS) located in Albuquerque, NM and to private provider SPS’s located in the following cities:  Fort Smith, AR, Oak Ridge, TN and Amarillo, TX.  Quest Diagnostics, Inc. is the only known facility at this time that has the capability to provide the required standardization/continuity and base line comparisons with previous laboratory tests conducted using Quest Diagnostics, Inc. as the initial laboratory source.  Changing variables would prevent interpretation of the experiments already in progress and would jeopardize the results of the initial testing performed by Quest Diagnostics, Inc.  The tests must be resulted by noon the day after the specimen is obtained.  If the tests are not resulted within the required time frame, the Government will incur additional time and cost because the clients will have to return to the SPS for clearance and/or retesting.  The clients are only in the particular location for a short period of time, and the test results must be available by noon the next day.  This is critical to the FOH as well as our customer agencies that rely on these test results for fulfillment of their organizational mission.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Marine Signal, Smoke and Illumination, MK 124 MOD 0, NSN 1370-01-030-8330 and NSN: 1370-01-144-3561. This item is utilized by all branches of the service to identify personnel locations at night and during the day; commonly used during rescue and recovery operations. Personnel carry the signal in life vests and flight suit pockets. It can also be located in life raft survival kits. The signal is a hand held device and consists of an aluminum case approximately 5.375 inches long, 1.625 inches in diameter, and 8 oz. in weight with a protective rubber cap on each end. The case has two raised beads on the flar e end (for tactile identification) and a label on the outer surface visually listing the flare/smoke ends and operating instructions. The case contains four subassemblies: flare igniter, smoke igniter, flare candle, and smoke candle.  The igniters, (located on each end of the signal, one for the flare candle and one for the smoke candle), are one-hand operable, and consists of an arming lever, a spring mechanism and a striker pin. The arming lever is extended and cocked. When released t he spring transfer the leverÃ¢Â€Â™s energy to the striker that impacts a primer and ignites the pyrotechnic. The flare display is red and the smoke signal display is orange; the display burns approximately 20 seconds and 16 seconds respectively. The harsh environment and life saving role of this signal dictate strict adherence to specifications to ensure reliable operation.

<SUBJECT>A--EXPLORATION SYSTEMS ENTERPRISE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<DESC>This RFI is being processed out of the NASA Office of Exploration Systems, Acquisition Strategy and Business Formulation Division (Code TB), 300 E Street SW, Washington DC 20546-0001 in lieu of the MSFC contracting address referenced above. Background With the announcement of the Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, NASA has formed a new Exploration Systems Enterprise that will be charged with development of systems to be used in the exploration of the moon, Mars, and other destinations.  The Exploration Systems Enterprise is responsible for developing and demonstrating the strategies and systems that will allow human and advanced robotic exploration of other worlds through the use of innovative approaches, new vehicles, and breakthrough technologies.  Consistent with the National Space Exploration Policy, the NASA Strategic Plan, and the Vision for Space Exploration, the Exploration Systems Enterprise will: Support Research at Key Research Destinations:	The development of exploration strategies, systems, and technologies will be guided by requirements for conducting research at key destinations in the search for habitable environments and life.  These destinations include, but are not limited to, the Moon, the planet Mars, the moons of Jupiter and other outer planets, and deep space telescopes that will search for planets outside our solar system. Enable Sustainable Exploration:  Exploration architectures and vehicles will be developed with the goal of enabling sustainable, affordable, and flexible exploration of the solar system. Employ Humans and Robots:  Exploration Systems will design architectures and missions that use humans and robots in partnership, leveraging the capabilities of each where most useful. Use the Moon as a Testing Ground for Mars and Beyond:  The Exploration Systems Enterprise, working with the Lunar Exploration and Mars Exploration Themes, will use robotic and human missions to further science, and to develop and test new approaches, technologies, and systems, including the use of lunar and other space resources, to support sustained human space exploration of Mars and other destinations. Employ Sound Management Philosophy: The Exploration Systems Enterprise will be guided by a philosophy that ensures that operators and technologists work together to enable the leveraging of technology research and development. Technology will be matured prior to development through performance demonstration. A disciplined Strategy-to-Task-to-Technology process will be instituted for purposes of requirements definition. Rigorous trade study analysis, utilizing modeling and simulation, will be performed by operators and technologists jointly. A focused program management process, using best practices such as earned value management, will be at the core of this enterprise. Work Closely With Customers and Partners:  The Exploration Systems Enterprise will work closely with NASA’s Space Architect, Space Science Enterprise, Biological and Physical Research Enterprise, Space Flight Enterprise, other government agencies, potential international partners, academia, and industry in the development of new exploration strategies, architectures, vehicles, systems, and technologies. A key focal point for these guidelines and objectives will be the Project Constellation systems development initiative.  In broad terms, Project Constellation is one of the critical acquisition programs being developed under the Exploration Systems Enterprise to execute the national vision for Moon and Mars exploration.  More specifically, Project Constellation will evolve around the core Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) that will carry human crews from the Earth’s surface to orbit.	When coupled with transfer stages, landing vehicles, and other space transportation architecture elements, the CEV will serve as part of the architecture that supports humans on voyages to the moon and Mars. Along with the CEV and in-space transportation systems, Project Constellation will include development of supporting surface and in-space systems such as ground and in-space communication systems, robotic investigators and assistants, surface mobility and habitation systems, maintenance and science instrumentation, mission control capabilities, launch vehicles, and Earth-based ground infrastructure.  Considered in its entirety, “Project Constellation” refers to the complete system-of-systems required for human and human/robotic exploration activities on the Moon, Mars and beyond. Systems development in Project Constellation will be integrated with ongoing efforts in Project Prometheus, which was constituted to support technical development to advance space nuclear reactor, power conversion, radioisotope power systems, and electric propulsion technologies for robotic science missions, with the first identified mission for these technologies being the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission.  With the advent of the Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, Project Prometheus has been directed to examine nuclear systems that can also enable human exploration of the Moon, Mars and beyond.  These systems could potentially use nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), multi-megawatt nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), or a combination of systems. Additionally, highly energetic robotic missions (with high delta V propulsion requirements) may also require these technologies.  Human exploration missions requirements could also include the need for high-power, all weather, day and night, electrical power generation for surface applications.  Surface power applications could include power for planetary habitats, in-situ resource utilization, mobility, science laboratories and instruments, and drilling systems. Acquisition Strategy Because it is not realistic to define all architecture elements precisely at this time, the Exploration Systems Enterprise will formulate its acquisition strategy for human and robotic exploration of the moon and Mars into an integrated set of sequential acquisition programs called spirals.  The initial spiral will be structured based on a well defined end-state, specific requirements, current technologies, manageable risks, an executable budget, and knowledge gained through lessons learned from prior missions.   Currently, Spiral 1 for Project Constellation will develop a test vehicle in 2008, an unmanned Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) in 2011 and a first manned CEV flight demonstration in 2014, in addition to the development of systems required to support initial human and robotic missions to the moon. The development of the requirements and starting point for the next spiral development effort, Spiral 2, will be based on the findings, demonstrated risks, and other outcomes occurring during Spiral 1 development.	 Requirements and capabilities desired for Spiral 2 development will also be based on a robust technologies maturation program.  This program will be targeting the maturation of new or possible breakthrough capabilities for potential inclusion in the Spiral 2 or subsequent spirals. Subsequent spirals will evolve based on successful deployment of previous spirals, new capabilities, maturation of new technologies and scientific discoveries. This will allow NASA to respond flexibly to new opportunities while avoiding costly redesign.  Each on-going development stage, or “spiral”, will incorporate technologies that are then ready for in-space applications. Accordingly, future spirals will incorporate new technologies.  In each case, new technologies will be considered for incorporation into the acquisition strategy for that spiral based on a robust risk model.	This risk model will ensure that new technologies are incorporated within in-space systems only after extensive analysis of potential benefits, costs and risks.  The Exploration Systems Enterprise’s acquisition strategy will encourage the use of open systems architectures that facilitate upgrade and augmentation, and that enable interoperability between systems developed by different contractors.  This will allow for the infusion of new technologies whenever they are available, while avoiding costly redesign.  For example, modular components can be substituted at minimum cost as new technology matures or obsolescence occurs.  This acquisition approach will also allow for a testing and integration schedule that is flexible and efficient. RFI Guidelines White papers are invited that address initial challenges facing Project Constellation and Project Prometheus in general, and the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) in particular.  Enclosed are the key focus area, issues, and suggested white paper topics.  White papers that examine one or more of the topics are invited.  Papers that address other important aspects (in a manner consistent with the information requested below) are also welcome. Viable white papers should be consistent with the January 14, 2004, U.S. Space Exploration Vision, as well as with generally accepted laws of physics.  Innovative approaches—including novel technologies and systems concepts—are welcome, but should be consistent with advances that are ‘reasonably achievable’ in supporting the established program milestones. Crew Exploration Vehicle herein means the system or systems that may provide basic crew transportation from earth to LEO and beyond. CEV functionality nominally includes the crew earth ascent, life support, habitation, maneuvering and propulsion, navigation, and earth entry, descent and landing capabilities required to carry out a lunar exploration mission. White papers will be reviewed by evaluation teams that draw on senior officials from the Exploration Systems Enterprise, other NASA Enterprises, and NASA Centers.  For this RFI, no awards will be granted.  But in a series of NASA Research Announcements (NRAs), Requests for Proposals, and other contracting vehicles to be released following this RFI, the Exploration Systems Enterprise will give innovative teams the opportunity to extend their efforts into funded concept definition, technology maturation, and development activities. All documents should be delivered in an electronic format using Microsoft Word.  All documents shall be delivered electronically to the following location: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/CodeT_RFI   Papers should be delivered to the following Focus Areas: Design Principles, Objectives, and Guidelines; Crosscutting Design Drivers and Architecture Elements; and Program Management, Acquisition, and Interfaces.  Each submission will receive an electronic notification of a successful upload. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited.   By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information impliedly consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which NASA releases and disseminates the information for review.  Review may be performed by multi-disciplined review teams.  Review teams may be comprised of Government personnel from NASA’s Exploration Systems Enterprise, other NASA Enterprises, NASA Centers, and/or other Government agencies.  Moreover, review teams may include third parties, such as contractor personnel who support NASA.  As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.

<SUBJECT>70--Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for Sole Source Acquisition of Eagle Point Engineering Design Software
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item.  The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has a requirement for approximately 41 packages of engineering design software modules (data collection, COGO, road calc, profiles, drafting, site design, surface modeling, data transfer) and 2 graphics engines, and 1 upgrade from Eagle Point 14.  These modules will update AutoCivil survey compatible software.  AutoCivil software is no longer updated or supported.  The California NRCS Engineering Technology Committee has tested three engineering design and survey software packages.  NRCS intends to issue a sole source award to Eagle Point Software for this requirement.  The reason Eagle Point software was selected is that they will permit the software modules to be purchased individually; their software program works with AutoCAD versions 13, 14, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005 and the Eagle Point Graphics Engine, they have education/training program curriculum designed solely for NRCS, they offer custom programming for NRCS applications, e.g., grassed waterways and channels; and its software is the only software which can directly process AutoCivil survey points already downloaded on NRCS computers without additional steps.  NAICS Code: 511210, Software Publishers; size standard $21.0 million.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as
prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 and FAR 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The  Solicitation Notice is No. AB133F-04-RP-0040 is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.    Background and Objective: NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) provides scientific and technical support to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the management, conservation, and wise use of the west coast's marine and anadromous resources.  The Fisheries Resource and Monitoring Division (FRAM) of the NWFSC is charged with conducting research and scientific analysis on the groundfish fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the coast of Washington, Oregon and California.  FRAM Division of NWFSC has a requirement for Aberdeen-style trawl gear to be used for resource assessment and other fisheries research activities.  The trawls will be fished from chartered commercial trawlers ranging from 400 to 650 horsepower, and will be spread by 5 foot by 7 foot steel Vee-doors.  The trawls will be used throughout the region where FRAM conducts its assessment and research activities, i.e., the waters off the west coast of the continental United States, from the Canadian boarder to the Mexican boarder.  The d depth strata will range from near shore environments of 30 fathoms (180 feet), out to depths of 700 fathoms (4200 feet), and will be towed over variable topography and bottom types.  Currently, FRAM deploys four nets per season, on two separate and distinct passes down the coast (North to South).  The of these nets were purchased in 1999.  all nets have seen significant wear and use.  Since 2000, FRAM has expanded its survey capacity.  In 2002, FRAM's West Coast Survey Team deployed their nets approximately 37 percent more than in 2000 from 363 to 575 tows) while in 2003 net deployment increased another 11% from 2002 (575 to 641 tows).  In 2004 FRAM proposes to survey 900 plus sites with 6 vessels, this represents an overall increase of approximately 250 percent in net deployments and a 33 percent increase in total vessels used from year 2000.  The time between passes has been truncated significantly but the necessity to refurbish the nets has not been diminished.  Six years of survey work has taken its toll on the trawl gear.  This acquisition of eight new nets would solve many problems.  1) Reliability:  As mentioned earlier, damage and wear has been demonstrated because of regular survey deployment.  New nets built according to specific specifications will enhance consistency and diminish the possibility of gear failure.  2) The introduction of eight (for a grand total of 12 nets) new trawls int the net rotation would allow FRAM  to carry out its second "pass" down the coast without having to refurbish the nets at a private net loft in the five to ten days it currently has scheduled these passes.  Because the gear will be used on small chartered commercial vessel fishing under adverse circumstances and with limited repair facilities, it is especially important that the gear be fabricated by vendors with substantial experience supplying Aberdeen-style trawl gear to the coastal groundfish fisheries and the class of vessels likely to participate in FRAM's research and resource assessment programs, and the gear must be built according to accepted industry practices and with specified materials listed in the trawl and rigging specifications.  (Offers must request copies of the drawings and diagrams from the contract specialist, Jan Sullivan).

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions:

Amendment 0001 

The purpose of this posting is to amend combined synopsis/solicitation N00421-04-T-0131 to remove and replace the existing non-skid surface at the MK-7 Arresting Gear site onboard the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, Maryland.  See, original posting of 16 April 2004.  This amendment 0001 is to answer questions received on the original posting, as follows:

QUESTION 1 (paraphrased):  I ask that you require the contractor to be qualified to SSPC (Society for Protective Coatings, formerly Steel Structures Painting Council) QP-1.  This requirement was a joint effort by NAVSEA and NAVAIR effective 1 October 2003.  

ANSWER 1:  The work statement for CLIN 0001 is changed to ADD the certification requirement, as follows:

All offerors shall be certified per the SSPC-QP1 program and remain certified for the duration of the project.  The contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer of any change in its certification status.  Information on the SSPC certification program is available at www.sspc.org.  No other certification will be considered.  

QUESTION 2:  It would also be nice if you set this aside for Total HubZone.  

ANSWER 2:  Types of set-asides were considered prior to release of the combined synopsis/solicitation.  A Total HubZone set-aside was not deemed in the Government’s best interest for this requirement.  

QUESTION 3:  The synopsis/solicitation states award is anticipated by 1 May 2004, but later states proposals are due by 4 May 2004.  Please verify/clarify the dates.

ANSWER 3:  The anticipated date of award is corrected to read 10 May 2004.  

There is no change to the proposal due time/date of 3:00 p.m. (EDT) on 4 May 2004.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.  

QUESTON 4:  Will a faxed quotation be acceptable?

ANSWER 4:  A faxed quotation will be acceptable.  Offerors are reminded, however, that they are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate Government official receives the complete proposal in a timely manner for it to be considered for award.
