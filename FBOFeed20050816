<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) has a requirement to install and optimize a narrowband 4-site digital, wide area, ASTRO simulcast communication system on the Island of Hawaii.  The communication system is required in order to ensure voice communication between the observatory and field crews, helicopter pilots, and other agencies in Hawaii, especially during periods of increased hazardous volcanic and seismic activity; the new narrowband system is required by the Department of Interior. The equipment for the new system has already been purchased; the equipment is onsite at the observatory. Installation must be approved and coordinated through Hawaii County, which is also installing a new radio communications system for the Police Department. The County of Hawaii has agreed to provide HVO access to new antenna towers and accompanying infrastructure (for example, buildings and power) for HVO's new radio system, which significantly reduces USGS costs for installing and maintaining the required radio system infrastructure. In order to provide access to the County's infrastructure, the County has requested HVO to work only with a qualified Motorola vendor to install and maintain the new narrowband radio system; the County is also in the process of installing their new radio system and our installation work must not adversely affect their system and infrastructure in any way. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) to Motorola, Inc.'s U.S. Federal Government Markets Division.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ; no written solicitation will be issued.  This may represent the Government's only written notice of this procurement.  This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds. This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-04, dated 08 July 2005.  No numbered notes apply.

The Brigham Young University Plant and Soil testing Lab has been analyzing soil samples for USGS from the inception of our current research program.  In order to make certain that the results from previous years and sites are comparable, it is imperative that the same soil testing facility continue to analyze and test future samples.  Quality control measures are the most important and most variable in attempting to get results that can be used in comparison with other data.  These measures may include temperature control, measurement of chemicals used in testing and equipment calibration.  Disparate results from another lab would seriously compromise our research.  USGS will provide samples for analysis which will be due 90 days after receipt. One or more of the following tests will be performed on samples: Nitrate; Phosphorous; Potassium; Organic Matter; Zn, Fe, Mn,Cu; pH& salinity; pH, BC, SAR; CBC; Texture; Exchangeable ions; Total nitrogen; Particle size analysis; Sand size fractions; Calcium carbonate; Mineralizable N; Resin capsules with incubation; Resin capsules without incubation; Resin bags.  Plant Analysis: P1 - N, P, K, Zu, FE, Mn, Cu, Ca, Mg, S, N, Nitrate, Root CEC.   Period of Performance: Date of Award for 1 Year and up to 4 option Years. This notice is for informational purposes only.  Simplified Acquisition procedures will be used with an estimated award date of 10/01/2005.  This is not a request for competitive quotes.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond within 10 days of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by facsimile to the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9339 or email vfriesner@usgs.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with the requirements of Section 3.2.2.4 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), this public announcement is hereby issued to declare the intention of the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) to increase the contract cost ceiling for purchase of additional software object code licenses and travel expenses, on a single source basis to Sunhillo Corporation of West Berlin, New Jersey, under existing contract DTFACT-04-C-00002. Sunhillo is the singular owner of the software object code for the licenses being purchased.  Therefore, Sunhillo is the only contractor available for purchase of the required licenses. Travel requirements on the above referenced contract have increased substantially past what was originally intended at contract inception.  This is due to NAS modernization programs that have required changes to the En Route Communications Gateway (ECG).  Travel is required to each of the FAA's 20 ARTCC's and other parts  of the country to support these changes. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions/inquiries resulting from this announcement shall be addressed to Chris Gallagher, Contracting Officer, at chris.gallagher@faa.gov.

<DESC>Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).     MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) have been missing from the Medicare Contracting environment. CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The law directs CMS to conduct full and open competitions for new MACs, that will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries, and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program. As such, CMS anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC).     

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers. In addition to the core A/B MAC workload, CMS anticipates including optional services to be performed. Optional services include functions related to Graduate Medical Demonstration and the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration. It is anticipated that this competition will result in award of one, stand-alone A/B MAC contract.     This contract will include a base year and four, one-year options.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Melinda (Miki) Lewis, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-5461, or by sending e-mail to Melinda.Lewis@cms.hhs.gov. E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers. Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) by mid September 2005.

<DESC>The Contract type being considered is a Firm-Fixed price type contract.  The DOE/AL intends to purchase the following item: AN/PSQ-18 M203 Day/Night Sight (DNS)         Quantity 165 The AN/PSQ-18 M203 Day/Night Sight (DNS) is an enhanced fire control system for the M203 40mm grenade launcher.  The DNS provides increased firing accuracy over the current quadrant and leaf sight systems for both point and area targets from 35 meters to 400 meters in day or night conditions.  The increased first round accuracy is enhanced because the DNS LCD displays the distance to the target, has indicators that show the correct cant of the weapon, and an IR pointer and IR Illuminator for aiming at night while using night vision goggles.  This provides 24-hour first round hit capability for the operator, reducing inaccuracies.  Accuracy is of critical importance for this system so the mission can be successful. The AN/PSQ-18 DNS by Insight Technologies is the only acceptable equipment that will meet the OST objectives.   The DNS is the only sight discovered during research that will add day/night capabilities to an operator using an M203 system.  The following are the unique characteristics incorporated within the AN/PSQ-18 DNS. â€¢ Integral Aiming and Target Illuminator Beams. â€¢ DNS can be mounted on either the 9 in. or 12 in. M203 tubes. â€¢ Achieves better than five-meter accuracy, day or night. â€¢ LCD displays distance in meters, cant indication & low battery information. â€¢ IR pointer pulsates when launcher is canted off-center. â€¢ Uses a single AA battery â€¢ Waterproof to 66 ft. â€¢ Meets all US Military environmental shock and vibration requirements. Since the OST is a unique paramilitary organization, it is imperative that our equipment meets standards that are equal to or exceed the durability our US military requires. â€¢ Tactile button controls IR pointer. â€¢ Mechanical range scale for firing without battery. â€¢ Integral iron sights. â€¢ Lightweight-17.7 oz. â€¢ The DNS can be mounted and dismounted in the field without tools. â€¢ During night operations conducted with Night Vision goggles, the DNS aiming laser will pulsate when the weapon is canted and will become steady when the weapon is vertically oriented. â€¢ The DNS is equipped with an optional Safety Block for force-on-force training that prevents the operator from accessing the non-eye safe modes of operation. The DNS does not diminish the rate of fire for the M203 40mm grenade launcher at 5-7 rounds per minute. The DNS has five modes of operation; OFF, DAY MODE, AIM LO, DUAL LO, and DUAL HIGH. The basic contract award amount is estimated to be less than $222,000. The contract shall be awarded prior to 30 September 2005. The needed delivery date for a partial order of approximately one-fourth of the above is 5 October 2005, one-fourth is requested by 5 November 2005 and the remainder is required by 5 December 2005.  Shipment will be to US Department of Energy/NNSA, Office of Secure Transportation; 4th Ave. Bldg 1789, Barling, Ar. 72923.  All items will be accepted at an earlier date if available. Shipment will be FOB destination. Accordingly, the NNSA Service Center intends to conduct this sole-item/sole-source procurement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and no other items or sources will be considered. A public solicitation will not be available. Numbered note 1 applies. This notice satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 5. This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids, nor does it represent a commitment by the government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement.  Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firm ability to provide a product as described above.  Any questions or comments pertaining to this action shall be faxed to (505) 284-7597, ATTN: Gail Gourley, NNSA Contract Specialist, not later than 31 August 2005.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement, DG133C-05-RQ-1820, constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued.  From September 1997 until December 2004, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) maintained a contract with OrbImage Corporation for full resolution data for the world from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor SeaWiFS data on the Orbview-2 satellite.  The SeaWiFS sensor is used to characterize factors that alter the color of the ocean, including algal blooms, chlorophyll, suspended sediment, and other pigments.   For US coastal waters, NOAA has found that SeaWiFS is a key sensor for operational and research activities.  As subsequent ocean color sensors have different bands and characteristics, comparison of data sets for operational or climatologic requirements is problematic.  In order to meet needs for Ocean Observing Systems for operational and climatologic studies, and for development of applications of government ocean color sensors, NOAA/NESDIS/Office of Research and Applications continues to have a requirement for SeaWiFS high resolution data.  Accordingly, NOAA requires the acquisition of a license for the rights to the specified data.

UNICOR has contracted with Global eProcure to conduct the reverse auction for this solicitation.  However, use of this phrase shall not be construed to imply that this solicitation is being conducted under the procedures set forth at FAR Part 14, Sealed Offerding.

Offerors will not be required to submit pricing with written proposal.

Offerors will have the ability to submit revised pricing during the reverse auction in response to prices submitted by other offerors.  The identity of offerors will not be revealed to each other during the reverse auction.  The final such revision during the reverse auction will be considered the Offeror's final revised proposal.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to factors other than price with the offerors at anytime.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to suspend or cancel the reverse auction at any time.  If the Contracting Officer cancels the reverse auction, Final Revised Proposals will be requested by an amendment to the solicitation.  Notwithstanding FAR 52.215-5, offerors will submit revised pricing only through the online mechanism supplied by Global eProcure.  Offerors will not submit revised pricing via any other mechanism including but not limited to post, courier, fax, E-mail, or orally unless specifically requested by the Contracting Officer.   The reverse auction offering period shall be set by the Contracting Officer as indicated in Section IV, paragraph (a).  Electronic offers shall be submitted by offerors during the reverse auction period.  The reverse auction is designed to extend the closing time of a offers lot if there are any offers placed in the final 2 minutes of the offering lot.  If an offer is placed within the last 2 minutes of the closing time, the time period shall be extended for two additional minutes beyond the scheduled closing.   Any offeror experiencing difficulties during a reverse auction must notify Global eProcure immediately.  “Difficulties” include any event or problem, which interferes with the offerors ability to participate in the reverse auction and may include, but is not limited to: data entry errors, software problems, or hardware problems.  Offerors will have five minutes after a Lot goes into “Verifying” status to notify Global eProcure of any problems.  If the Contracting Officer judges that any offeror has been disadvantaged by a problem, they may direct Global eProcure to address the problem and return the Lot to “Open” status.   Any and all offeror contact with Global eProcure is for the sole purpose of facilitating the reverse auction and shall not be considered discussions with the offeror within the meaning of FAR Part 15.   For purposes of FAR 52.203-2, and in accordance with subparagraph (c) thereof, submission of a proposal by the offeror shall be considered certification by the Offeror that the only knowing disclosure by the offeror of its prices to any other offeror will be during the reverse auction.  The offeror further certifies that disclosure by the offeror of its prices during the reverse auction shall not be for the purposes of restricting competition.  UNICOR reserves the right to reject any or all offers received for any or all lots.  REVERSE AUCTION – RULES.

Offerors who have not done business with UNICOR shall complete the ACH form, which can be found on UNICOR’s webpage.  A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database. If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov, Business Commercial Opportunities, Navigate to, Scroll down to Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all times.   ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:Past Performance, specification and Price.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  The solicitation will be available on UNICOR’s website at www.unicor.gov and eps.gov on or about August 18, 2005.  No copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  All responsible offerors may submit an offer, which will be considered.

HU25 FULL FACE QUICK DONNING OXYGEN MASK PART NUMBER (P/N) MF10-03-02 REPAIR/OVERHAUL
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
22 JUNE 05

1.	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Masks, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, were installed in these aircraft in 1991 and are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  

2.	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or an FAA authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.  Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications In Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition and will be replaced as necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6) years. 

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair.  First, a “return to service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy., Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.) if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements (component time continues). Secondly, an overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary. An overhaul zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO). 

The Contractor shall install Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to Hose Assembly P/N DTS series for both repair and overhaul.  

The Contractor shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

The Contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul oxygen masks.
The Contractor responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

3.	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE APPLICABLE:

3.1	OEM Component Maintenance manual: 
CMM 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003

3.2	CG Technical Orders:
3.2.1	CG TCTO HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992
3.3	Data Availability:
3.3.1	OEM manuals, Service Bulletins and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the Coast Guard.
3.3.2	Coast Guard specific CGTOs, can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Submit a written request to:

Commanding Officer
Attn:  ARSC FOIA Officer
United States Coast Guard
Aircraft Repair & Supply Center
Elizabeth City, NC 27909

4.	SERVICE BULLETINS
All OEM SBs previously incorporated shall remain incorporated. SBs which upgrade the component or improve reliability shall be incorporated upon approval of CG’s Contracting Officer.

All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.   52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items:  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the Low Price Technically Acceptable offeror.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: (1)	Technical Capability (2)	Past performance (3)	Price  In order to be rated “Technically Acceptable” overall, the proposal must be rated “Technically Acceptable” in the evaluation factors Technical Capability and Past Performance.  Offerors that are rated “Technically Unacceptable” on Technical Capability will not be evaluated for Past Performance and will not be considered for contract award. (1)  Technical Capability of the item(s) offered to meet the government requirement  To be determined technically acceptable, the Offeror must meet all the minimum specifications/standards stated in the purchase description for Item 0001.  Offerors shall (a) furnish technical information, which may include technical specifications, product literature/brochures and photos to demonstrates or confirm that the offeror meets all aforementioned minimum specifications and (b) provide a statement or explanation to demonstrate how it will meet the required delivery schedule.  Failure to meet anyone of the minimum specifications and the required delivery date will render the proposal “Technically Unacceptable”. (2) Past Performance Offeror's Past Performance information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for at least 3 of its most current and relevant contracts.  Current is defined as a contract (or subcontract) in-progress or a contract (or subcontract) completed within the last 3 years.  Relevant is defined as a contract that is current and also any Federal, State, or local government, or private contract that is for items similar and/or identical to those required under this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Quotes which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. For each contract provided as a reference, the Offeror should provide the following information: CONTRACT INFORMATION Contract Number:             							  Date Completed: Contract Type: (Specify) Item Description and Quantity: Customer Name: Customer POC: (Person who can verify data) Address:                       Telephone:                               Fax: QUALITY NOTE:  An explanation must accompany all answers with an asterisk(*). Was consideration or a monetary withhold for non-conforming supplies/services or late deliveries assessed against this contract?      YES *  (Explanation) NO Was/is any part of this contract terminated for default and/or in litigation?  YES *   (Explanation) NO         Was any warranty work completed on delivered items?  YES *   (Explanation)  NO Did you receive any quality awards in the past three years? YES *     (List Awards) NO TIMELINESS Were all items delivered within the original contract schedule? YES       NO *  (Explanation) The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: (a) Neutral:  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available may receive a neutral rating for past performance. The evaluation of past performance will take in account past performance information regarding timely delivery of a quality product conforming to the solicitation/contract requirements. The Government reserves the right to review past performance information and if deficient in demonstrating an "acceptable" risk, rate the past performance either as "neutral" or "unacceptable."  The Offeror must provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  An Offeror failing to provide the past performance information or to assert that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance may be considered ineligible for award. (b) Acceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts met contractual requirements.  The Offeror’s past performance record leads to an expectation of adequate performance, with little risk anticipated with delivery of a quality product, on time, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Offeror's past performance. (c) Unacceptable:  The Offeror’s performance of previously awarded contracts did not meet most contractual requirements.  Offeror’s past performance record leads to a strong expectation that successful performance will not be achieved.  Significant potential risk is anticipated with delivery of a quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Offeror's past performance. (3) Price (a) Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  Performance risk assessments may be conducted as appropriate in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d)(3).  The Government will evaluate quotes on the basis of total aggregate price of all services.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all line items.  Quotes shall:   1) Show the proposed unit price and/or extended price.  In case of discrepancy between a unit price and an extended price, the unit price will be presumed to be correct.  (b) An offeror must propose a price on all line items. Any quote failing to do so will not be considered for award   The Government intends to make a single award for all line items.  Note: In evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (1) to be technically acceptable, Factor (2), Past Performance, is approximately equal to Factor (3), Price.  However, the degree of importance of price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals with regard to Past Performance.  Each initial quote should contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  The government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.   All responsible Offerors shall submit quotes that include firm-fixed pricing, FOB Point, delivery time, payment/discount terms, all applicable technical documentation and information required by the solicitation and a completed Offerors Representations and Certifications.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL, (NSWC PC) intends to solicit competitive proposals for the design and fabrication of a high performance lift fan system for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) based on a performance specification to be provided by the Navy.  This requirement will be fulfilled using full and open competition. The high performance lift fan basically consists of the rotor and bellmouth assembly and will be designed for efficient operation in the present LCAC volute. There will be three major requirements for the high performance lift fan system; (1) increased aerodynamic fan efficiency, (2) reduced maintenance cost and time, and (3) reduced weight, compared to the existing LCAC lift fan system.  Quantified goals and threshold values for the three requirements shall be provided in the RFP.  In order to meet these requirements, a combination of innovative designs, advanced materials, and fabrication and assembly methods may be required.  A new lift fan system that meets these requirements will result in an improved range, increased payload capacity and the reduced life-cycle cost of future and, potentially existing assault connectors. The Government may potentially award multiple contracts as a result of the RFP subject to availability of funding. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 336413 applies. FSC is 2835.  To request the RFP e-mail to gerald.sorrell@navy.mil. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL, (NSWC PC) intends to solicit Hydroid, Inc., 6 Benjamin Nye Circle, Pocasset, MA 02559-4900 for twenty-eight (28) each P/N 102610-2-102611-81 Transponders and ten (10) each P/N 102611-81 Transponder Firmware. The current SDV docking sonar transponder (DS-3) has an obsolete computer board and its reliability and range has degraded over time. Also, the DS-3 transponder is large and heavy to carry. A detailed evaluation of options recommended that the SDV DS-3 transponder be replaced with the Hydroid transponder. The Hydroid transponder is currently used in the SAHRV and the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), both of which interface with the SDV. The firmware will be added to the DDS transponder making them interoperable with the SAHRV. Converting the SDV DS-3 transponder will make the SDV 100 percent compatible with SAHRV and the DDS sonar systems. In addition it will simplify maintenance/troubleshooting procedures and logistics sup! port. Equipment will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity- Panama City, Receiving Officer, building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Panama City Beach, Florida 32407, for the procurement of engineering support for several critical combat weapon systems integral to the MCM-1 and MHC-51 Class ships.  This support includes management and repair of these combat weapon systems:  AN/SLQ-48(V) Mine Neutralization System (MNS), AN/SQQ-32(V2/V3) Sonar, OK-520 Sonar Winch, AN/SSQ-94 MIW Simulator, AN/SSN-2(V4) Navigation System, and AN/SQH-4A Battle Space Profiler System.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Accomplishment of the engineering services requires key contractor personnel be located in Ingleside, TX.  IPS is the only known source with personnel residing in Ingleside, TX, who have the required extensive experience with all of the MCM combat weapon systems (AN/SLQ-48(V) Mine Neutralization System (MNS), AN/SQQ-! 32(V2/V3) Sonar, OK-520 Sonar Winch, AN/SSQ-94 MIW Simulator, AN/SSN-2(V4) Navigation System, and AN/SQH-4A Battle Space Profiler System) that are to be supported on this effort.  IPS personnel possess an in-depth familiarity with the processes and procedures in place at SCRMC, pierside in Ingleside, TX, and aboard ship, all of which are instrumental to successful accomplishment of the U.S. Navy tasking.  It is estimated that obtaining any other source for this effort would increase its cost by as much as 150%.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) with the University of  Colorado to investigate optical pumping effects in atomic vapors with the goal of generating high-contrast coherent-population-trapping (CPT) resonances for use in compact atomic clocks. High-contrast resonances are important since they result in increased signal-to-noise and therefore better clock performance. The specific tasks that will be carried out by the University are as follows:  1) Write and publish two papers on the results obtained; 2) study selective population of magnetically-sensitive CPT states using elliptically polarized light and 3) design a compact device based on the results of task 2, capable of demonstrating an increased CPT contrast and better clock stability.

It is the Government's belief that the skills of researchers engaged by the University of Colorado uniquely qualify them for this work. Interested sources proposing to supply the specified services must submit a written qualification statement clearly establishing the capability to meet the above requirements within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.   Responses are due via mail or FAX by August 11, 2005.  No RFQ package is available. This procurement is being conducted per Simplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13 (NTE $100,000).  Anticipated award date is August 12, 2005.

<CONTACT>Matthew Johnson, Contracting Specialist, Phone 202/606-1518, Fax 202/606-1464, Email mjohnson@opm.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is issued for a proposed acquisition to be solicited under Full and Open Competition procedures.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in Washington, DC will be issuing a Solicitation for Applications that will establish firm-fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination for dental and/or vision benefits to be provided based on the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004.  The Government may award multiple contracts for dental benefits and for vision benefits.  We encourage interested parties to submit offers either as a single entity or as a consortium.

We invite interested offerors to review our draft statement of work (SOW) and provide comments.  We will post the draft SOW on the OPM Website on or about August 25, 2005 at: http://www.opm.gov/carrier/dentalvision/dvbidders,asp.  We invite comments from interested parties on topics you think we should consider to ensure a healthy competition among offerors and provide prospective offerors with the necessary information to effectively develop a response to the Solicitation.  We must receive comments by 3 p.m. September 6, 2005.  We will consider the comments and questions when finalizing the Solicitation however we will not disclose any questions or comments that are submitted.

We are also requesting comments on our proposed timeline for implementing the dental and vision program.  While the timeline will be included in the draft SOW, potential vendors are encouraged to comment on it immediately at the following email address: DENTAL-VISIONBIDS@OPM.GOV. Our current timeline for procurement actions leads up to a July 2006 start date.  We are soliciting input on the preferences of interested vendors for a later date in 2006 that would be more compatible with other Federal employee benefit programs that operate on a calendar year cycle.  Concerns about a mid-year start date include potential increased underwriting risk and/or low enrollment for the initial six month enrollment period.  While we are prepared to address these concerns, if industry reaction indicates that a mid-year startup is not optimal, OPM will consider a start up date based on the beginning of the last pay period in 2006 and revise the proposed timeline and SOW accordingly.  If this course of action is followed, both will be reissued for comment at a later date.

TENTATIVE TIMELINE:

2005;	August 25 - SOW posted on OPM’s web site for public comment;	September 6 - Vendor comments due to OPM;	September 16 - Solicitation for Applications issued;	September 30 - Interested Parties Conference;	November 16 - Vendor bids due
2006;	January 16 - OPM bid review, negotiation and final proposal revision;	February 28 - Contract awards and contract negotiations;	April/May - Open Season enrollment;	July 1 - Effective date.
 
Under this timeline, the Solicitation will be issued on or about September 16, 2005 with proposals due on or about November 16, 2005.  An opportunity for questions will also be offered. Our award decision will be based on a best-value determination: All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, will be approximately equal in importance to cost or price.

At a minimum, proposals must include the following: 1) A detailed statement of the benefits offered (including any maximums, limitations, exclusions, and other definitions of benefits); 2) The premiums proposed and underlying assumptions; 3) Demonstration of proven experience in providing dental and/or vision benefits to public and private sector organizations, and 4) Demonstration of the financial resources necessary to bear the insurance risk.  Proposals will be evaluated using weighted factors, as described in the Solicitation

The base period for contracts awarded will be seven years, with option periods each consisting of seven years.  There will be no limit to the number of options the Government may exercise.  Assuming a July, 2006 start date, the base period would begin on or about March 1, 2006, with program benefits to be available to enrollees on July 1, 2006.  The Solicitation for Applications will be available exclusively for download electronically approximately 30 calendar days after the date of this posting through the Federal Government’s Federal Business Opportunities [FedBizOps] Website: http://www.fbo.gov.  

The NAICS code for this requirement is 524114 (Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers), with the small business size standard associated with this NAICS code of less than $6 million in average annual sales for the preceding three years.  OPM will consider all responsive sources that submit a proposal.

<DESC>DESC:  The Development & Fielding Systems Group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH intends to negotiate a sole source contract to Nevada Learning Series for the AFMC Regional Services Consolidation for training guides for Microsoft Office products to be used as quick reference training materials for the AFMC Advanced Messaging System user community. The AFMC Advanced Messaging System requires an easily utilized training guide and quick reference guides that explain the basics of Microsoft (MS) Office applications used in conjunction with this system. Additionally we require that these guides be customized to include our Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) which describe why we do things a certain way within the AFMC Enterprise network environment. They also provide a reference once training is completed for students to refer to. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a) (2), the government is negotiating directly with Nevada Learning Series. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the capability within three days of this publication.  A determination by the Government not to complete this action based on response received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Contracting Officer may be contacted by email at sally.roliff@wpafb.af.mil.   NAICS code: 611710 An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Address issues, concerns, and questions regarding this acquisition to the contracting officer.

<DESC>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. NASA/GSFC plans to obtain mission services to support laser ranging operations to artificial earth satellites, on Mt. Haleakala, Maui, which is part of NASA SLR Network, from the University of Hawaii, Institute for Astronomy (IFA).  The period performance will be 5 years.  These services are a continuation of the scientific and engineering mission operations support for the NASA Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) program. The services required include operations of a satellite laser tracking station. Other services include maintenance and calibration of TLRS-4, the transfer of data to the NASA central data collection facility, and system upgrades if required to maintain compatibility with the rest of the NASA SLR Network.  The University’s observatory at Mt. Haleakala has been the site of Goddard’s SLR for over 30 years. During that time, the station has been compiling and maintaining a database that is critical to NASA’s work on a global tectonic motion data solution. Accurate data collection is based on the use of two, well defined, fixed geometric reference points. Mt. Haleakala is one of those fixed reference points (the other is at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD). Mt. Haleakala’s exact geometric location is known within 1 centimeter of uncertainty and changing this reference point now, after 30 years of data collection, would adversely impact NASA’s global tectonic motion data solution over the next decade. This database also plays a role in monitoring and identifying trends which pertain to geophysical events all over the world. Any break in gathering and processing data, or modification of the database would critically impact Goddard’s Space Geodesy efforts. Due primarily to the critical geometric location of the University of Hawaii observatory and to the importance of continuity to the SLR database, the Contracting Officer has determined that the Government’s requirement for the Satellite laser Ranging Station cannot be obtained from any other source than the University of Hawaii.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  See note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), State and Local Brach (SLB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to The Northeast Energy Efficient Partnerships, Inc. (NEEP) of Lexington, MA. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain a white paper on energy efficiency measurement and verification protocols. This white paper will support  the SLB and its Clean Energy-Environment Partnership Program as it works with states and localities to examine and promote cost-effective clean energy policy options that can help address air quality, lower greenhouse gases as well as yield other economic, public health and energy benefits. The  protocols to help guide the measurement of energy savings, determine program cost-effectiveness and quantify other values will enable states to better assess the ability of energy efficiency programs to meet their needs, and to select the most promising programs from an array of options.  Such  protocols can also support states that are interested in measuring the performance associated with energy efficiency goals or targets.  However, with a number of protocols currently in existence, states do not always have a clear sense of which protocols are appropriate.  In addition, as clean  energy efforts are increasingly approached on a regional basis, it is more challenging to coordinate the use of protocols across states in the same region to allow for better policy making.  This is particularly true in the Northeast, where efforts to advance energy efficiency are among the most  pronounced of any region. It has been determined that NEEP is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement because of its ability to increase marketplace availability and adoption of quality energy efficiency practices and technologies; its national presence while maintaining a  regional focus; and expertise in energy efficiency measurement and verification efforts and related state policies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that  believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses  to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami Rodgers via e-mail at rodgers.jami@epa.gov.

The CSPD  initiative is in response to the following IDEA mandates:  •	Sec. 612 (a) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997  (PL 105-17):  (14) Comprehensive System of Personnel Development:  “The state has in  effect, consistent with the purposes of this Act and with section 635(a)  (8), a comprehensive system of personnel development that is designed to  ensure an adequate supply of qualified special education, regular  education and related services personnel that meets the requirements for a  state improvement plan relating to personnel development in subsections  (b) (2) (B) and (c) (3) (D) of section 653.”(15) Personnel Standards (A)  In General:  “The State educational agency has established and maintains  standards to ensure that personnel necessary to carry out this part are  appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.”  In response to these  requirements and to address the professional development needs of OIEP  personnel who work with students with special education needs, the  BIA-OIEP has developed a plan which encourages partnerships with Tribally  Controlled Community Colleges (TCCC) and state institutions of higher  education. Through this initiative, the BIA-OIEP seeks to continue  quality, sustained and on-going in-service and pre-service programs to  ensure that OIEP staff are adequately trained and receive continuing  education to appropriately serve students with special education needs. PURPOSE:  The Office of Indian Education Programs-Center for School Improvement  (OIEP-CSI) is requesting proposals to deliver professional development  programs for OIEP personnel who work with students with special education  needs. The goals of this initiative are to: (1) increase the number of  state certified special education teachers in BIA funded schools, (2)  increase the number of paraprofessionals with an AA degree, in early  childhood, special education or general education in BIA funded schools  and (3) provide training and technical assistance opportunities on topics  related directly to serving students with disabilities and their families  and addressing issues for schools in corrective action status under NCLB.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the East African Community (EAC) Upper Flight Information Region (UFIR) Project.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has recently signed a feasibility study grant with the EAC Secretariat to develop an UFIR for the EAC.  The objective of this project is to create a single block of Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upper airspace over member countries, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.  
   
The EAC envisions the new Upper Area Control Center (UACC) will control a UFIR, and that the existing three Area Control Centers (ACCs) will be responsible for the lower air space of the national Flight Information Regions (FIRs), as currently defined. The UACC will coordinate with the ACCs of partner states and FIRs adjacent to the EAC.  The cost of implementing the UFIR is estimated at $48 million, including equipment, services, and some training.  Financing for this project is expected to come largely from the generation of user fees and through the assistance of bilateral and multilateral donors.

Feasibility study tasks include:
o	Task 1:  Project Initiation and Kick-off Meeting
o	Task 2:  Evaluate Previous Studies 
o	Task 3:	  Evaluate ATC Operations
o	Task 4:	  Evaluate ANS Systems Conditions
o	Task 5:	  Analyze and Project Future Optimal Traffic Flows, Routes and Loads for the UFIR and the UACC
o	Task 6:   Provide Baseline Report
o	Task 7:	   Identify and Evaluate the Air Traffic Services (ATS) Organization for the New UFIR and UACC
o	Task 8:	   Identify and Evaluate Potential Interaction Requirements for the Interactions between the UACC and National Low Altitude Airspace Systems
o	Task 9:	  Develop CONOPS for Implementing UFIR and UACC
o	Task 10: Identify the Possible Locations for the UACC and Interim Meeting
o	Task 11: Develop Requirements for UFIR and UACC
o	Task 12: Design System Architecture for UFIR and UACC
o	Task 13: Cost Benefit Analysis
o	Task 14: Air Space Redesign 
o	Task 15: Evaluate the different options for ownership & financing of the UACC 
o	Task 16: Evaluate Expected Development Benefits of Proposed Project
o	Task 17: Provide Final Report Deliverables

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in Parlier, Ca. has a requirment for a Cryotransfer System for a Hitachi S3500-N Scanning Electron Microscope.  The system should have a large enough Dewar to privent the operator from constantly having to refill the Dewar.  The metal coating device should be the "gol" type and should be able to last for a large number of speciment coatings.  Gold depositing should be controlled by the operator to allow for optimal specimen coating.  The cryofixation by plunge freezing in mitrogen slush, the cryofracturing, and the gold sputter coating should all take place under a vacuum, in a cryohamber which can be mounted on the side of the microscope.  This will help prevent the specimen from being exposed to the atmosphere after it has been frozen.  The system should have a binocular view to alow the operator to align the fracture blade with the specimen and afterward be able to see if the cryfracture occured in the desired plane or if another fracture must be made.  This feature is very important if the number of specimens is limited.  
An RFQ can be obtained by mail or fax to the attention of Saul Garcia as listed in this notice.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for SSGN compatible hardware kits and the effort required to install the kits on new production Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) capsules and retrofit existing CCLS capsules.  Upon completion of installation and/or retrofit, these capsules will be compatible with the SSGN submarine Multiple AUR Canister (MAC).  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort and is currently in negotiations to award a CCLS production contract.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this upgrade to the CCLS, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort and was awarded a CCLS production contract in June 2005.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this upgrade to the CCLS, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), Cancer Statistics Branch (CSB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Inc., 2 Berkeley Street, Suite 403, Toronto, Ontario, Canada to develop a program in Electronic Pathology (E-Path) to measure coding accuracy.  SRP procured the E-Path software and licenses from Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) under purchase order 263-MQ-320585.  E-Path is an automated software application for coding cancer morphology and topography in pathology reports.  It is a key component of the system used to identify and categorize reports in the SEER's Central Cancer Registries.  To date, no assessment has been made of the ability of the system to correctly identify the codes under which a report is actually registered.  AIM will establish a method to efficiently determine coding performance in the automated coding systems.  The data is to be derived from all reports as well as for subsets.  The subsets pertain to specific cancer sites or morphologies and their combinations.  Coding accuracy will be calculated for sensitivity and specificity to measure overall performance, identify subsets of reports in which accuracy is low and unreliable, and also high which would be relied upon to eliminate the need for operator review.  Thus the coding accuracy measuring system would be able to isolate subsets of reports in order to determine performance for that subset.  Artificial Intelligence in Medicine is the only known source to the NCI Researcher who can create this program. AIM is the sole provider of E-Path this is a program that will run in E-Path which is proprietary software they developed by AIM which is used by the SEER Cancer Registries.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 30, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Ellen A, Inc., 671 Tingle Ave, Bethany Beach, DE  19930 to build and test enhancements to the RBB’s Government owned custom designed sonobiological effects apparatus.  The custom designed sonobiological effects apparatus was procured under purchase order 263-MQ-415354 from Ellen A Inc.   One of the projects RBB is studying is the sonobiological effects in liquids due to high intensity ultrasound exposure.  Cavitation is responsible for the high temperatures and pressures needed to create energetic chemical species that are the focus of studies using this apparatus.  Cavitation occurs when acoustic pressure due to the passage of ultrasound through the transmission medium interacts with gas-filled voids called cavitation nuclei.  Within a faction of an acoustic cycle or over many cycles, depending on the intensity of the ultrasound, the void grows and collapses until it becomes unstable.  During the final collapse, the local temperature within the interior of the bubble and an interface at the gas liquid boundary exceeds 5,000 ºK.  High temperatures and pressures produce free radicals which are responsible for the observed chemical products.  Recently, Umemura et al. has shown the addition of a second harmonic ultrasound signal to the fundamental signal can enhance sonobiological effects.  This approach may have important clinical applications for controlling cavitation production in vivo.  Ellen A is to build the enhancements to RBB’s sonobiological effects apparatus that will provide the experimental conditions needed to study cavitation phenomena due to second-harmonic superimposition.  Ellen A shall:  1) extending the operating frequency of the apparatus; 2)  provide a means to measure the acoustic field generated by the apparatus; and  3)  providing non-perturbing fixtures for additional types of experiments.  The contractor shall ensure all mechanical, electronic and software changes are fully compatible with the existing apparatus.  Dr. C.L. Christman, Founder and CEO of Ellen A, Inc. is an internationally recognized authority in ultrasound dosimetry and was the first to show that microsecond pulses of 1 MHz ultrasound can lead to free radical formation in aqueous solutions.  Ellen A is the only vendor qualified to make these enhancements to the Government owned sonobiological effects apparatus.  It is expected that up to 10-fold increase in the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (the synergistic effects of drugs and ultrasound) in tumor cell killing by using this new apparatus.  These enhancements must be compatible with the existing equipment and the only source known to the NCI researcher that can meet the aforementioned requirements is Ellen A Inc. The Government’s intent is to upgrade one of its instruments, and capability statements offering a new instrument or that will not maintain the warranty and service plan of its Government owned Ellen A Inc sonobiological effects apparatus will not be considered.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 25, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

Delivery via either contractor or government provided tank trucks or bulk fuel containers to various activities around the world.  Additional delivery via contractor provided railcars to two storage facilities in California and Texas.

Due to the lengthy testing qualification (one year) required before a contract can be awarded, this announcement is being issued to provide adequate notice for companies that have not previously qualified to supply this product to submit samples.  Testing procedures are listed below:

Your attention is directed to Military Specification document MIL-DTL-25524E(USAF), dated 20 November 1997.   This document can be found at:  http://assist.daps.dla.mil/online/start/  (select “Quick Search” on left side of screen. Under “Document ID” type MIL-DTL-25524E.  Select the hyper-link under “Document ID.”  Scroll to bottom of page and select/print the adobe file labeled “Revision E”).

To qualify for a contract, you must provide a JPTS sample for storage stability testing.  The JPTS sample shall be manufactured identically (i.e. using the same process and feedstock) as the JPTS you intend to offer if awarded the contract.  The sample is to be submitted to the Air Force Petroleum Office (Det 3, WR-ALC/AFTH) 2430 C Street, Bldg 70, Area B, Attn: Mr. R. Wilkes or Mr. J. Young, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7103 (POC phone numbers 937-255-8103/4311), in sufficient time for the storage stability testing to be accomplished prior to 1 January 2007.  To submit a sample place 200 ± 3.8 liters (53 ± 1 gallons) in a 208-liter (55-gallon), 18-gauge DOT 17E uncoated steel drum and ship it to Det 3, WR-ALC/AFTH  2430 C Street, Bldg 70, Area B, Attn: Mr. R. Wilkes or Mr. J. Young, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7103 (POC phone numbers 937-255-8103/4311).   All costs associated with shipping the sample will be born by the offeror and reimbursement is not authorized.  Det 3, WR-ALC will store the sample at 54.5ºC (130ºF) for 1 year (12 months).  At 3-month intervals, Det 3, WR-ALC will draw samples for thermal stability testing (see 4.5.2.1 of MIL-DTL-25524E).  At the conclusion of the 12-month storage stability test, Det 3, WR-ALC will subject the fuel to all test requirements of table I of MIL-DTL-25524E.  If the sample fails any of the 3-month thermal stability tests or 12-month specification tests, the fuel shall be re-sampled and retested to validate the initial results.  Failure of the thermal stability test at any of the 3-month intervals or failure of any of the specification tests performed at the conclusion of the 12-month storage stability test constitutes a failure of the storage stability test and renders the sample submitter as ineligible for contract award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This notice replaces W15QKN-05-T-0728.  The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to award on a sole source basis to Air Products and Chemicals the requirement for Developing and Demonstrating a process to Purify 2,4 Dinitrotoluene (DNT) to be used as a Feed Stock for the Production of Trinitrotoluene.  This award will result in a 7 month research and engineering effort to produce a process which will raise the purity of commercial DNT to Military requirements.  This  action is in the best interest of the Government as it will allow the same supplier who will be able to meet the requirements of the Government.   Transition of the technology from pilot studies to the production facility would be faster and less costly, compared to the development of the process by one  supply with implementation by another.  POC for this action is Cathy Kallistros ckallis@pica.army.mil.  See NOTE 22

<DESC>Amendment 1 issued 8/16/05 to modify Statement of Work.  See Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, Minimum Education. Announcement edited to add Statement of Work, Attachment 1. The Enterprise Services Center (ESC) at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, requires assistance in the development of its Project Management Office (PMO) to include both the definition and implementation of the PMO as contemplated by the attached Statement of Work (SOW), Attachment 1.   This initial Screening Information Request (SIR) represents a Request for Information (RFI) (SIR/RFI No. 1) that will enable the FAA to make a screening decision to determine the firms that possess special standards of responsibility that would enable them to perform the required services.  The FAA reserves the right to add vendors and/or other sources which meet the special standards of responsibility criteria and have performed satisfactorily on previous procurements.  Accordingly, it has been determined that only firms currently possessing the special standards of responsibility as set forth at "a" through "e" below will be permitted to advance to the second phase of the screening process.  The second phase will be a Request for Offer (RFO) and will be designated SIR/RFO No. 2. Special Standards of Responsibility: 	a.  Vendor demonstrates an understanding of the requirement (Ref. Statement of Work, Attachment 1) and possesses the necessary expertise and capabilities. 	b.  Vendor has successfully implemented at least two PMOs within the last four years. 	c.  Vendor has successfully implemented at least one PMO of similar size and scope within the last four years. 	d.  At least one member of vendor's proposed project team has implemented a PMO of similar size and scope and that person is Project Management Professional (PMP) certified. 	e.  Vendor has knowledge of and has performed at least one "Organizational Project Maturity Model" (OPM3) assessment for a previous client.  An offeror's submittal in response to SIR/RFI No. 1 must demonstrate how the special standards of responsibility identified at "a" through "e" have been met.  For "b" and "c," the submittal must identify the company, organization, agency, etc., and point of contact by name with current phone number and e-mail address for verification purposes.  A submittal shall not exceed five (5) pages in length.  A page is defined as one side of a "sheet."  A 1-inch (all around) margin must be utilized.   The font/size must be "Times New Roman/12 pitch."   Submissions that state that the offeror understands, can, or will comply with all statements in the SOW and statements paraphrasing the SOW requirements or parts thereof, are considered insufficient.  Phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed," or "well-known techniques will be used," etc. will be considered insufficient. The requirement contemplates an indefinite-delivery/requirements type contract with a base year and includes option provisions to renew for two additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  The proposed contract will incorporate AMS Clauses 3.2.4-35, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, and 3.2.4-34, Option To Extend Services. The resultant contract will employ a time-and-materials pricing arrangement, and includes the following skill categories:  (a) Program Manager, (b) Project Manager, (c) Project Support, IT Analyst, (d) Junior Project Support, IT Analyst, (e) Financial Analyst, and (f) Technical Writer. The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:00 p.m. local time, August 22, 2005.  Responses are to be e-mailed to Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov.  If all requested information is not provided in the submittal, the vendor's response may be determined as unacceptable and, therefore, not afforded further consideration.  If you have questions, contact Connie Houpt at (405) 954-7820. (Note:  Receipt of offers, as well as modifications and withdrawals of offers in response to this SIR/RFI (SIR No. 1), will be processed in accordance with AMS Provision 3.2.2.3-14 entitled, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals).

The solicitation will be available over the Internet only.  NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.     All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.     The POC for this acquisition is Lt Megan Schmid (302) 677-5226, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at megan.schmid@dover.af.mil.

The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate exist aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.  Interested parties should submit a brief capability statement which details current or recent experience in providing similar aircraft modernization solutions.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from potential offerors and reclassify the small business size standard. 

Question (1): Would you prefer a solution to include a range from 900 to 2500 nm? Or, were you thinking that something along the lines of 400 - 2500 nm is preferred? 

Answer (1): The spectral range must include a 900 to 1700 nm, with a goal of additional coverage outside this range as stated in the specification.  The additional coverage from 400 to 2500 nm would be helpful, however the imager must not use any expendable cryogenic liquid, or a mechanical crycooler as stated in the specification. 


Question (2) After review of the RFP, a throughput model vs. wavelength was conducted for the system to estimate SNR’s, etc. and found what I think is an error in the spectral radiance tables in the RFP.  Table 2 is the spectral radiance vs. wavelength that we get at the sensor for a 30% target, and Table 3 is the radiance we get for a 100% target (want the camera’s output from this radiance to be below the saturation level of the pixels).  So, I would expect the ratio of the radiance values from the two tables to be about 3.33.  However, they are of the ratio of 33.  When I did the SNR estimate and photoelectron counts for Table 2, that seemed reasonable; but the photoelectron counts using Table 3 looked way too high.

Answer (2): The spectral radiance values listed in Table 3 are incorrect.  The specification has been revised and is posted at the following URL: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/RFP/05ms06.htm 
The spectral radiance values listed in Table 2 are correct.

The small business size standard is revised as follows:

The U.S. Geological Survey, GD, CICT Denver, CO, has a requirement for an upgrade for existing electronics controller from QMG 421 to HIQUAD QMG700, which is used to analyze via mass spectra of dynamically pumped inlet gas, complex mixtures of active gas species dissolved in ground water, trapped in fluid inclusions, sampled volcanic and geothermal volatiles, coal bed methane and methane hydrate mixtures. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from the manufacturer, Pfeiffer Vacuum, 24 Trafalgar Square, Nashua, NH, and proposes to negotiate a purchase order with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to support strategy development to increase effectiveness of the PROACT Environmental Information Clearinghouse service.  PROACT supports dissemination of information and knowledge that contributes to AFCEE's efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain leding-edge techniques. A specific objective of this RFI is to support creation of a virtual library on technical environmental resources that will be integrated into the fabric of HQ AFCEE. The environmental information exchange service should function as maps and Yellow Pages that point to knowledge but do not contain knowledge.  The virtual library concept is viewed as part of a core knowledge infrastructure supporting all programs, domains, and disciplines consistent with AFCEE’s roles and responsibilities including PROACT and the existing Air Force environmental training program, AFCEE/TDE Web University, hosted on the HQ AFCEE web site.  Additional objectives of this information support program are:  to communicate environmentally relevant Air Force guidance and policy; to facilitate development of technical guidance by discovery and delivery of relevant technical information that supports subject matter experts; to assist teams of professionals in conducting root-cause analysis; developing collaborative solutions to technical requirements, and quality evaluations.  Information received will be used for strategic planning functions that include: defining core infrastructure requirements; change and enhancement of the PROACT Information Clearinghouse program; change and enhancement of Web University; identification and deployment of measurement systems, program analysis, planning, and development; benchmarking and process migration.  The enhanced system must be responsive, accurate, flexible, and offer value-added products.

Requested information should consider both human and technical attributes for integration of data, documents, web sites, publications and subject matter experts.  The approach will address information/knowledge requirements identified in the PROACT Information needs assessment; the AFCEE IT Strategy Report as well as advances in knowledge management and lessons learned within the Portal, GCSS-AF, AF Knowledge Now, and the DoD’s Network Centric Enterprise Service (NCES) Architecture.   The resulting AFCEE strategy must support conduct of the organization’s mission.  The overarching objective of this RFI is to develop approaches to revise and update information and data systems to better identify the most appropriate contextual knowledge, not necessarily the most readily available, consistent with advances in the practice of knowledge management techniques.

Provide recommendations and conceptual approaches including but not limited to, techniques, software and hardware, as well as processes and procedures for developing an automated system for information management and process integration.  Consider:  management of data, information and knowledge contained in internal and external documents and databases; personnel resources of the Air Force and AFCEE, approaches to “mine” organizational data and information and/or knowledge sources in order to improve business practices.

PROACT

The Air Force (AF) PROACT Environmental Information Exchange service has been in operation since October 1992 and has answered over 25,000 technical inquiries from AF military and civilian personnel, with customers at every organizational level from installation personnel to the Secretary of Air Force (SAF).  The PROACT environmental information exchange helps Air Force personnel and current Air Force contractors meet pollution prevention goals and maintain environmental compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. The PROACT information researcher currently provides answers to technical inquiries using databases; publications; library services; expert consultants from industry, AF, DoD, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), as well as state and local regulatory agencies as appropriate.  Tracking and documentation of customer data includes personal data and information from past inquiries, customer contacts, date of response to the customer, and time spent preparing response.  

Problem Definition: How do we create new capabilities consistent with Air Force Portal requirements to assist the end-to-end AFCEE business intelligence and analysis processes in addressing the Knowledge Discovery challenges while laying a foundation for the technologies of tomorrow?  This problem includes the following elements:

1. Massive, heterogeneous, unstructured, scattered, and unreliable data
2. Identification of complex, time-critical concepts
3. Capabilities for evolving user defined agents to assist in hypothesis investigation and “what-if” scenarios
The massive amounts of input data must be selected and presented in a way that drives the discovery and maximum use of the knowledge desired.  To do this, the volume of data must be reduced and filtered so that users are only provided with relevant data.  The approach must be sufficiently flexible to take advantage of current technology and allow phased upgrade of the initial capability to achieve interoperability with future advances.  Recommendations should include the evaluation of indigenous Air Force Portal Capabilities, off-the-shelf software, hardware and information/knowledge management techniques in order to optimize information and knowledge exchange.

Information products must communicate known guidance and policy, support Air Force Program Managers, comply with Department of Defense policy and guidance, and promote use of DoD sources and tools databases.   Information products and sources should be searchable using key words and concepts while remaining appropriately accessible for management evaluation.   The process must include metrics to identify and track customer-based priority targets that require special emphasis.  Information products should address key issues of importance such as recent rule-making activities, and regulatory updates or summarize technical responses to inquiries of general interest which are designed to reach the broadest range of Air Force callers and installations.  The information system should support development of solutions to previously unanswered problems including discovery of relevant, state-of-science information as well as identify subject matter experts.  The information developed and maintained in the system should be proactively diffused using multi-media cross feed products that are responsive to needs of the Air Force environmental community and promote corroboration in application of knowledge.  All products must be consistent with AFCEE policies and quality standards.
GOALS 
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, this RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for: 
 
1. Using state-of-the-art technology to develop enhanced information discovery along with environmental library resource management techniques that support the Environmental Information Clearing house program.
2. Suggested methods to collect, index (with a systematic numbering system) and file information from vendors and/or AF personnel concerning environmental technologies or products which could be implemented at military installations.  The expected result is the development of a content aggregation, organization, and discovery capability consistent with the policy, goals, and directives of the U. S. Air Force CIO concerning the Air Force Portal and methods for content management.
3. Methods for tracking usage of the information service, monitoring and assessing customer awareness of program services, effectiveness, customer satisfaction and identifying information needs.  Please include recommend approaches (such as advertising) or initiatives to maintain awareness and relevance of the service to Air Force stakeholders.
4. Approaches for database management, security access control, indexing, search, and geospatial software/standards, security certification and accreditation, along with any integration services necessary to complete system development.
5. Approaches to employ outside technical publications, services, subscriptions, licenses and other methods for streamlining access to technical and professional publications, guidance documents, as well as the policy, regulations and instructions which are essential for accomplishing the AFCEE mission.  Please incorporate recommendations with regard to design, modeling, selection, and implementation of technical information management systems necessary to advance the basic capabilities from both a hardware and software perspective.
6. Approaches to coordinate and leverage reporting of current events, communication, outreach and training related to topic areas such as:  Web University, Technology, Performance Based Management (PBM), Remedial System Optimization (RPO), Waste Management, Pollution Prevention, Sustainability, Natural Resources, and Cultural Resources.

WEB UNIVERSITY

The WebU system automates training delivery, stores, manages, and delivers information and tools, provides access to environmental information and resources, and serves as a portal to other environmental education and training resources and providers. WebU resides on two servers and operates in a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database environment, which allows users to interact with the Environmental Education and Training (EET) database through an interface consisting of HTML, JavaScript, and Active Server Pages.  WebU scripts allow users to enter, edit, and track environmental education and training data equal to the user’s level of permission and generate a variety of real-time reports.

The EET database consist of 20+ tables containing Air Force occupational series and job codes, performance-based tasks, regulatory mandates, unit equipment codes, training source information, course content, student and faculty information, and other data required to generate the Web University website.  The EET database functions as a Learning and Content Management System (LCMS or LMS) to deliver:  automated registration and authentication of student and faculty members; user ID and password management; management and delivery of course content; student activity tracking; test generation and scoring, and certificate management.  Reports generated by the database include web trends, user and course reports, the Area of Responsibility Checklist for overseas theaters, Air Force Environmental Task List, and the DoD Sources and Tools Catalog.  Authorized users are also able to upload documents such as meeting Minutes and briefings for long-term storage.

PROACT currently supports Web University through cross feed of requested Web University educational materials and collection of feedback forms and information.

Problem Definition: How do we integrate current and new capabilities to most effectively leverage resource to optimize information and training support; increase customer access, and streamline access, registration and other interactions?

GOALS
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, This RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for:
1. Using state of the art technology that will support distance learning.  
2. Managing student enrollment, delivery of training content, assessment of training effectiveness, curriculum development, course content management, and collaboration with external activities that provide relevant training.
3. Provide recommendations that will more fully integrate environmental information clearinghouse and environmental education and training activities.
4. Consolidating and integrating data contained in PRO-ACT and Air Force Environmental Education and Training databases to minimize duplication of effort, share resources, and provide on-line access to information and resources through the appropriate forum (i.e. PRO-ACT, WebU Library, etc.).  Consideration should be given to identifying and including information in the DoD Sources and Tools Database, referencing in WebU courses, and featuring in the WebU Spotlight to alert users to noteworthy events, news, and information.
5. Approaches for supporting WebU students and users.  Areas of consideration should include, but not be limited to, WebU Help Desk; recommended initial point of contact for content related questions; maintaining course links and references; monitoring and updating regulatory references contained in the Environmental Master Task List and Area of Responsibility Checklists, and identifying obsolete and additional tasks.
6. Approaches for developing and maintaining Environmental Facts Sheets or information summaries.  For example, a subject-specific Facts Sheet prepared as single or double sided information sheets with charts, graphs, and brief statements related to a specific topic or program.  Provide recommendation for approaches to select topics warranting information summary development; determining the appropriate number of summaries, and process to efficiently maintain current accurate content for all AFCEE program areas.

52.215-3 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) 

1. The Government does not intend to award a contract of the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31-205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
2. Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE – NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS – It is the policy of the US Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the US Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.   Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that US Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns the interested party is encouraged to contact the US Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.   Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in wiring, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protest fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:  Commandant (CG-85), 2100 2nd street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593.

Commissioner Jo Anne B. Barnhart leads the agency in its mission to enhance the lives of Americans through its leadership of Social Security programs.  The Office of Disability and Supplemental Security Income Systems (ODSSIS) is responsible for the software development life cycle (SDLC) of SSA’s eForms system. The eForms system provides an automated method for the disability determination claims and approval process. SSA estimates that the number of nationwide eForms users is approximately 79,000 including users in the DDS offices.  Currently, SSA maintains 2,870 active forms, 673 of which have been printed within the last four years on a regular basis. Within eForms, SSA has developed over 250 electronic forms using JetForm FormFlow Classic 2.2.  There are also seventy-nine electronic forms which have been developed using Adobe Form Designer 5.0.   The forms created in Adobe Form Designer 5.0 are accessed via the SSA intranet through a customized electronic forms product known as “FormSelector”.  FormSelector allows users to access eForms and provides a toolbar offering a common user interface for all forms.  In addition, several legacy applications interface with FormSelector. FormSelector’s custom Application Programming Interface (API) is used to invoke an eForm within an application. These applications are based on either web or client/server technologies. They have been written in technologies such as WebSphere, Visual Basic .NET, and Visual Basic 6. In addition to invoking eForms, these applications are also able to pre-populate fields with data.  SSA plans to migrate to a system that provides a solution that is primarily web-based. The software must provide SSA with a reliable, scalable architecture that permits users to access the system via the Internet or the SSA intranet. In addition, the solution should provide the ability to leverage current SSA technologies and be capable of adding functionality using standard development tools (e.g. HTML, Java, and JavaScript).  Correspondingly, SSA seeks a solution that enables a standard method of integrating the form solution with the existing legacy systems.  Accessibility Considerations of the Software:  Any software used at SSA must be compatible with Federal Government Section 508 Standards. Information concerning Section 508 standards can be found at www.section508.gov.  The software would need to be able to meet the following sections of Section 508 compliance:  Section 1194.21 – Software Applications and Operating Systems; Section 1194.22 – Web-based Internet Information and Applications; Section 1194.31 – Functional Performance; and Section 1194.41 – Information, Documentation, and Support.  The Social Security Administration uses the JAWS (speech input/audio output) and MAGic (screen magnification) products from Freedom Scientific Corporation, as well as Dragon software for mobility impaired individuals. All software must support these products.  Section 508 Compliancy: Interested vendors must be able to demonstrate in sufficient detail their ability to meet the Agency’s requirements (e.g., experience utilizing standards based technology and enterprise-wide web-based solutions). Vendors should provide the names and contact information of customers. We reserve the right to verify information with references. Vendors must be able to provide the following: reliable customer support, thorough documentation, and knowledgeable staff. Vendors must be financially stable and firmly established. Vendors submitting responses should indicate whether their products are available on the GSA schedule.  Vendors are requested to provide responses that describe how the product will accommodate SSA’s system needs as follows:  (1) Product Offering- Describe how the software fully encompasses the eForms solution.  (2) System Architecture-Describe the major design principles/elements of a potential technical architecture for an eForms system; and Address interfaces/interface processes to other applications and databases.  (3) eForms Conversion Process-Explain the conversion method and processes required to convert existing SSA eForms.  (4) Specific Requirements-Provide detailed descriptions of how the software meets the specific requirements for each of the following items: (1) eforms:  (a) Ability to manage the development of and modifications to eForms templates; (b) Allow for customization without significant programming; and (c) Add new functionality via widely used technology (e.g. Java, JavaScript).  (2) Richer User Experience:  (a) Navigation: Easily navigate to dynamically fill able fields, to other forms, and across other applications; (b) eForm Retrieval: Selection of form templates with quick and convenient access from disparate sources; (c) Enhanced features (e.g., Search feature, Spell-check, Toolbar actions, and Customizable dialog boxes); (d) Monitoring and Reporting: Allow for both ad-hoc and predefined reports that can be viewed, printed, and exported to other applications, as a method of providing metrics; (e) Integration: Seamless integration with other tools (e.g. Microsoft Word, Outlook, Excel); and (f) Printing: High resolution print quality.  (3) Standardized Interface-Ability to interface with multiple commonly used platforms and applications.  (4) Saving eForms- (a) Save an eForm to a specified location as a self-contained format supported by applications across multiple platforms; and (b) Save an eForm in a secure, protected format. (5) Document Repository-Provide compatibility with a document repository that allows for the submission of eForms.  (6) Data Propagation-Ability to handle pre-population of fields within a form by accessing other data sources, using standards-based Application Programming Interface (API) (e.g., HTTP, SOAP, XML, web services).  (7) Digital Signatures-(a) Digitally sign an eForm using standards-based authentication technology; and (b) Ensure non-repudiation of a digital signature.  (8) Processing- (a) Performance: Retrieve an eForm through an API call, open an eForm, enter data, and perform save functions in a timely manner; (b) Pre-process rendering (e.g., conversion of an eForm to HTML when needed); and (c) Status Tracking to monitor the status of an eForm during the workflow cycle.  (9) Flexible Storage Facility-Ability to store, manage, and retrieve eForm data and metadata for future reference.  (10) Security- (a) Provide robust security for data, both from within the form as well as from system to system; (b) Authentication to other applications with limited or no user intervention (i.e., user is not prompted to enter a user ID and password when submitting documents); (c) Restrict access to users based on the status of an eForm; (d) Provide authorization based on user roles; and (e) Ensure the inability for modifications to a digital signature.  (11) Deployment-Ability to deploy patches in a reliable manner, without resulting difficulties, compatible with standard tools (such as Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and Novadigm Radia) with limited client-side components and seamless updates without user intervention.  (12) Section 508 Compliance-Ability to meet Section 508 standards and to permit enhancements to improve the product’s accessibility.

<SUBJECT>D -- CPS Software Maintenance
<DESC>GSTC’s New CPS Software Maintenance Contract
August 15, 2005

Background
Single Edition Quadrangle (SEQ) maps and Secondary Base Series (SBS) maps to support the mission of the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service are produced at the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC).  These maps are produced on GSTC’s Cartographic Production System (CPS).  Two contracts were previously awarded to T-Kartor Sweden to help build CPS.  CPS architecture includes COTS technology in the form of ArcGIS and T-Kartor’s CPS NG, as well as custom applications to meet GSTC mapping requirements.

Description
The USDA Forest Service intends to award a follow-on contract to T-Kartor.  Software maintenance is required for T-Kartor’s CPS NG COTS product as well as all customized extensions of CPS NG that are used in CPS.  This contract will not require maintenance of ESRI’s COTS ArcGIS suite, however, required functionality that is not available in ArcGIS COTS modules shall be delivered by means of appropriate custom development.  

The new contract shall provide software maintenance beginning November 1, 2005 for up to five years.  It shall include maintenance to provide software defect resolution, developer-level technical support, updates to baseline software, and maintenance of online help documentation.

The new contract shall also provide the following optional deliverables:
•	Software enhancements
•	On-site technical support
•	Miscellaneous expert consultation
•	Additional production licenses (internal and remote)
•	Formal classroom training

The new contract will be awarded as a sole source procurement for the following reasons:
•	CPS NG COTS is proprietary software developed by T-Kartor.  Its maintenance or enhancement is possible only by T-Kartor, or with their permission and cooperation.
•	While the Government owns custom software developed by T-Kartor for CPS, it is tightly integrated with CPS NG COTS.  It is not reasonable to expect a third-party contractor to be able to maintain or enhance this customized software in an efficient, timely, or cost-effective manner, without the cooperation of T-Kartor.
•	Optional CPS licenses are available only from T-Kartor.
•	Without experience and skill with CPS development it is unreasonable to expect a third-part contractor to provide on-site technical support at GSTC.  
•	Without experience and skill with CPS development it is unreasonable to expect a third-part contractor to provide miscellaneous expert consultation.
•	Without experience and skill with SEQ and SBS CPS production it is unreasonable to expect that a third-party contractor could provide appropriate training.
•	The new contract will not require maintenance of ArcGIS software.  This is addressed by an existing USDA Forest Service agreement with ESRI.

<SUBJECT>66 -- ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMBER
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Espec North America, Inc. for the purchase of an Espec Environmental Chamber.  The Electromagnetic Properties of Materials Project requires the purchase of an environmental chamber for the development of a measurement system for characterizing the complex permittivity of dielectric substrates at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies. The testing of these materials requires the samples to be in a tightly-controlled environment, both in temperature and relative humidity. In addition the chamber size has to be large enough to accommodate the many resonators that NIST employs for measuring the dielectric substrates.  The Espec ESL-2CA Platinous Temperature & Humidity Chamber fits all of NIST’s specialized requirements. It has the necessary temperature and humidity range, constancy and uniformity. The workspace volume is sufficient (50 x 60 x 75 cm) for all of NIST’s resonators. In addition to these specifications, NIST requires a computer interface with the chamber, and the Espec chamber has a GPIB/IEEE-488 interface including instrument drivers. NIST measurements often require the use of liquid nitrogen, and this chamber has the appropriate intake valve. NIST does not have access to a water drain in its lab, and this chamber has a reticulating water supply that make a water drain unnecessary. Finally, NIST has to adjust its resonators while they are in the chamber, and this chamber has two glove ports that make resonators accessible.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not the use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and shall address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred). Anticipated award date is September 1, 2005.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Microbial Biophysics and Residue Chemistry Unit is seeking to purchase a Real-Time PCR Thermocycler.  USDA requires a Real-Time PCR Thermocycler to develop methods for specific, sensitive and rapid detection of foodborne pathogens.  Nucleic acid-based detection via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most rapidly growing method for the detection of foodborne pathogenic bacteria.  Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) allows the rapid detection of nucleic acid targets and multicolor RT-PCR.  Thermocyclers allow the detection of multiple pathogens from  a single sample.  The Real-Time PCR Thermocycler is to be furnished and delivered (F.O.B. Destination within Consignee=s Premises) to the USDA, ARS, Eastern Regional Research Center located in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania; in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications contained in this document.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 (current as of FAC 2005-5), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

The Solicitation number 106-035, is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ).  SCHEDULE OF ITEMS - Furnish and deliver, F.O.B. Destination a Real-Time PCR Thermocycler.  The instrument must meet the following minimum specifications:  1) The instrument must be licensed for PCR; 2) The instrument must be capable of multicolor real-time PCR.  Five-color detection is required to allow the analysis of 4 nucleic-acid targets (one color/target) in a single sample while reserving the fifth color for an internal control; 3) The instrument must be capable of multiple sample formats: 0.2 ml tubes for assay development , 96-well format plates for high throughput analysis, and 8 or 12 well strips for smaller numbers of samples;   4)  The instrument must be capable of operating in a gradient mode.  This feature allows for flexibility in PCR method development by allowing the formation temperature gradient across the heating block; 5)  The instrument must interface with a Windows 2000 or Window XP PC loaded with software to allow programming of PCR parameters and RT-PCR data analyses.  The software must perform melt curve analysis as well as qualitative and quantitative data analysis via endpoint and cycle threshold analysis.  The software must display amplification results in real-time (i.e., after each cycle) and save the results after each repeat to minimize data loss due to a power failure.  The purchase of a multicolor RT-PCR thermocycler will allow MBRC scientists to develop rapid, sensitive, and specific assays for the simultaneous detection of 2 or more pathogens from a single food sample.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number BPD-05-CI-0089 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-27.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541519 and the size standard is $21 M. The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the Office of Inspector General, Department of Interior, has an immediate need to acquire the services of a system that makes accurate electronic payments to an OIG traveler’s and/or vendor’s designated bank account and an OIG traveler’s Government Charge Card Account within three business days of the request.  Services are being solicited for a base period of October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006, and four one-year option periods.  

PURPOSE:  The Bureau of the Public Debt is serving as the contracting office and procuring third party payment services for the OIG, Department of Interior (DOI).   It is anticipated that there will be 2,000 payments totaling $1,500,000.   A three (3) percent growth per year in number of transactions and amounts is anticipated.

BACKGROUND:  The DOI, OIG is responsible for conducting audits and investigations for the U.S. Department of the Interior.  In the course of this work, official business travel reimbursements and vendor payments are extensive.  Reimbursement to employees and vendors for such costs are required and must be timely and accurate so employees can focus on their work and not administrative efforts that result from slow and inaccurate payments.  The OIG has established the JET Program (Journey with Error-Free Travel) as the foundation for travel operations.
 
Reimbursement of this type is already required via EFT.  OIG follows the Prompt Payment Act and the Federal Travel Regulations as they relate to payments.

The implementation of this contract is consistent with the need for effective government and the willingness to pilot innovative approaches to generate better solutions to government problems.  It also provides for a continued emphasis on a paperless office environment and is consistent with the goals of the OIG 5-year Automated Data Processing plan.  The plan will allow prompt payment to employees as required by law.  It is consistent with the FAIR Act.

The authority to contract for such work is linked to the Inspector General Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-452) in general and specifically section 6(a)(9) which states "...to make such payment as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act" and section 3(a) which states "each Inspector General shall report to and be under the general supervision of the head of the establishment....but shall not report to, or be subject to supervision by, any other officer of such establishment."

All payment processing is centralized in the OIG Division of Financial Management in Reston, VA.

	GOALS & OBJECTIVES:  a) The OIG will provide funding to the Contractor to make payments.  The preferred method to provide such funding is for the Contractor to collect funds through an OIG Contracting Officer’s Government Charge Card (currently Bank of America MasterCard).  If the Contractor proposes this method, related charge card fees will be reimbursed by the OIG.  These fees shall be included in the proposal.  Alternative funding options can be proposed by the Contractor.

b)	For employee travel reimbursement, the Contractor shall provide for "twin-pay" (Split Pay) which allows reimbursement to both a traveler's individual account and the traveler's Government Charge Card.
c)	Payments will be made daily (Monday – Friday, excluding Government holidays) to all sources as requested by the OIG.

The following Third Party Payment system controls are required: a)  Authentication of eligible employee via social security number or alternative number established by the OIG  b)  Employee’s claim limit   c)  A complete audit trail that tracks all transactions from OIG through reimbursement to the Contractor and from reimbursement to the Contractor by the OIG  d)  Must prevent the manipulation of data from input (request to pay) to output (payment)  e)  Strong internal controls, security of data and protection of privacy provisions that are well documented   f)  Must funnel payment data back through the file transfer Protocol or alternate process   g)  System must provide employees with a payment confirmation and/or verification number to make inquiries about payments with the Contractor or with the disbursing bank

This function will confirm the adequacy of WCMSAs and, as a result, will prevent the Medicare program from incurring costs that should have been paid by a WC carrier.  This initiative will not only create a streamlined process for review of WCMSAs, but will also reduce the time associated with such reviews and evaluations, ultimately enhancing the level of customer service to the WC industry.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

In addition to Title 13 protections to these data, they may also be covered by specific protections specified in the law of the source agency. If a contractor is given access to such information, he or she shall observe any additional agency confidentiality protections that must be implemented to protect these data. As with Title 13 data, the contractor shall be subject to additional penalties for violation of administrative record protection requirements.

<DESC>Statement of Work
Timber Stand Improvement and Road Reconstruction Project                   
Moody Air Force Base

I    Scope of Work

Scope : There are nine locations on main base where trees have been damaged from recent storms and/or beetle infestations that are to be removed. Approximately 120 acres
are to be roller-chopped of excess shrubs and undesirable vegetation. Approximately  1800 feet of logging road is to be reconstructed for year-round access.

II Technical Provisions

Removal of Damaged Trees;  Trees that have been storm damaged or beetle infested which are leaning, dying or have broken tops or stems, including trees damaged from neighboring wind blown trees, are to be cut down to ground level and cut into shorter sections and then piled. Piles shall be located in open areas that are at least 30 feet from the nearest overhead canopy to be burned later.  

Roller-chopping ;  120 acres are to be chopped with a chopping drum with a maximum length of 7 feet pulled by a D-5 dozer or comparable size machine. Equipment using rubber tires shall be approved by the forester prior to use. All chopper blades are to be sharpened prior to use and are subject to periodic inspection by the base forester or the contractor’s representative. Target plants include shrubs, hardwood saplings, vines and perennials.  Pine trees 2” in diameter and greater are not to be chopped or damaged.  Marked gopher tortoise burrows and Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) monitoring wells are to be avoided and not chopped or damaged.

Road reconstruction:  Approximately 1800 feet of logging road is to be ditched, filled with crushed rock and dirt where necessary and the surface crowned and compacted for year round use. Two 12 foot culverts (18” dia) will be installed to provide proper drainage.


III  Environmental and Safety Considerations

Protection of Wetlands and Streams  - Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent pollution of streams and wetlands from fuels, oils, chemicals or other harmful materials. Any waste of said materials shall be disposed of in accordance with EPA regulations. All streams and wetlands shall be kept free of contractor-generated debris.

Weapons Safety Footprint - Several of the proposed work areas are located within the safety footprint for the Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) range.  Work in this area will need to be coordinated with the CATM range officers and will be restricted to non-firing times.  Contractor may be required to work on weekends or other down days to accomplish the required work in these areas.

Accidents and Mishaps - The contractor will hold the Air Force harmless for any type of accidents or mishaps which may occur which are in any way related to the clearing and piling of debris on the property.  The contractor accepts full liability for any accidents related to the removal and piling of timber products on the property.
	
Trash and Debris - The Contractor shall leave no trash/debris/containers in the area, and shall notify the Environmental Flight (257-4980) upon release of any unauthorized substance(s) into the air, soil or water.

Archeological Resources - The contractor shall report any archeological artifacts (arrowheads, points, pottery, etc.) that may be found on the work sites to the Environmental Flight office (257-2396).
	
Endangered Species and Wildlife - The contractor must be aware of snakes, tortoises and other wildlife in the area.  Do not harass or harm any animals or their habitat on Moody Air Force Base.  Avoidance of wildlife all together is the best policy.

IV  Inspection 

Inspection by the Government of the work performed under this contract shall be made on a daily basis to assure contract compliance. 

V   Payment

Payment will be made in the amount agreed upon between the contractor and the Air 
Force after completion of the project and final inspection by the Contracting Officer’s Representative.  

Please contact Roy Durham, Contracting Officer for copy of map at 229-257-2053 or request map via email at roy.durham@moody.af.mil
