For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bid (IFIB) to provide Support to the ISAF Afghan Mission Network (AMN) and NCIA SP HQ Document Handling System (DHS) and Portal.
<p>In ISAF, in addition to AMN EP/DHS skilled staff, NCIA needs a service to be delivered by the contractor in order to guarantee stability, reliability, and sustainability of the AMN Portal and DHS in ISAF and future developments and customizations. At NCIA SP HQ SHAPE Mons, Belgium, there is a need for the provision of user help desk and software maintenance for the DHS system as well as on-site support in the event of system failure.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. bidders 1) must be pre-approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) must be in possession of a current facility security clearance at the level of SECRET. In addition, contractor personnel must be in possession of a SECRET clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCSA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFIB is IFIB-12-07-NCIA-SPHQ. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from the DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 18 December 2012<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued December 2012</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for mid-February 2013</p>

<SUBJECT>Four month contract extension for commercial Information Technology services for the period 01 January 2013 to 30 April 2013 in support of DARPA's Support Services Office (SSO) Information Technology Services (ITS) support and services effort.

<DESC><p align="left">This is a sole source synopsis for the acquisition of a four month performance period extension, 01 January 2013 to 30 April 2013, for current Unclassified IT Support and Services (UITSS) contract HR0011-06-D-0001 with Wyle Information Systems, for commercial Information Technology services in support of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Support Services Office (SSO) Information Technology Services (ITS) support and services effort. In accordance with the authority at FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", DARPA intends to negotiate a contract modification for the four month extension. This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement and is issued for notification purposes only. The current support services are set to expire on 31 December 2012 and the proposals received from the Solicitation Request for Proposals are still under review. While the contract was expected to be awarded on or about 30 September 2012, it is now expected that the contract will be awarded on or about 31 January 2013 and the four month contract extension will allow for adequate turnover of duties to a follow-on contractor. Having Wyle Information Systems continue providing the support services for the four month period is necessary because DARPA SSO/ITS requires a team of individuals that is familiar with the current DARPA IT environment and strategic plan in order to provide full-spectrum Information Technology (IT) Services including network an security architecture, file storage and backup, email and scheduling, server, desktop, laptop and printer provisioning and support, COTS and Legacy application provisioning and support, software development, Web page development and support, and configuration management for Agency personnel (approximately 1000 customers). On 7 March 2012, U.S. Army ACC-APG-RTP published a Request for Proposal with solicitation number W911NF-12-R-0002 on FedBizOpps for the subsequent acquisition of the commercial Information Technology services. The deadline to receive proposals was 27 April 2012.</p>

<DESC>This market survey is being reissued because of the change in the size standard for the NAICS code associated with this effort.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training) has changed from $7.0 to $10.0 million in average annual receipts.     The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms capable of providing instructional services of the nature described in the attached draft statement of work. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.     The FAA has elected to pursue a new business model for management and leadership development.  The nature of the work is instructional delivery, instructional design, instructional development, and the provision of classrooms and lodging for the attendees.       The FAA is seeking a quality learning environment in which managers and other internal and external customers develop greater mastery of their leadership responsibilities and the skills needed to achieve the agency's operational and organizational goals.     The developmental curricula are provided at the corporate level for all agency managers to imbue common core leadership principles and philosophy across the entire agency as a foundation.  The curricula consists of a range of deliveries from broad based leadership and management development for newly appointed managers to courses that are more directly focused on a single subject area with greater detail.  The courses are intended to provide logical, progressive and sequential leadership and management developmental opportunities throughout the employee's life cycle.  Courses vary in length from one (1) to nine (9) days and may be scheduled on a regular and recurring basis or scheduled when needs dictate based on FAA requirements.      The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide the learning services as described to the FAA.  Responses to this market survey will be used to finalize the FAA's acquisition strategy for the requirement.       The vendor selected will provide learning services, arrange for suitable classroom space in a facility that is within a reasonable distance of a national or regional airport and arrange for appropriate lodging for attendees in close proximity to the learning facility.   All metropolitan areas in the contiguous lower 48 states are being considered.        The planned period of performance for this effort is five years from date of award.  The award structure will include a 12 month base period with four 12 month option periods.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, seek to make human brain tissue and biospecimen samples more widely available for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
<p>The objective of this initiative is to increase availability of human disease and control biospecimens, increase proactive involvement of the disease advocacy and patient communities, and more efficiently acquire, curate, store, and distribute these tissues with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of nervous system disorders.</p>
<p>In order to do so, the NIH intends to establish multiple contract collection sites (i.e., the NIH Brain and Tissue Repositories (NBTR)) to provide services that will actively acquire, receive, process, store, curate, preserve, and distribute central nervous system and related biological specimens (including fetal tissues) to qualified investigators. These services were previously provided through grants that have expired and/or will be expiring in the coming years. The NIH will now continue these existing services through competitively awarded contracts. New sources are also encouraged to compete.<br /><br />It is anticipated that a full solicitation will be issued on or about December 4,&nbsp;2012, with proposals due on January 22, 2013.&nbsp; The solicitation&nbsp;will be posted at: https://www.fbo.gov<br /><br />All qualified organizations are encouraged to respond with a proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The original small business sources sought synopsis for this initiative (HHS-NIH-NIMH-SBSS-12-065) was posted on July 6, 2012.</p>

<SUBJECT>REDUCE STRAYING RATES OF BARGED JUVENILE STEELHEAD IN THE COLUMBIA RIVER

<DESC>NOAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of Washington for the purpose of performing research on salmon reproduction, imprinting, and genetics research. Period of Performance: February 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014, with options for performance in future years.<br />Pacific salmon and steelhead are well known for their ability to learn (or imprint to) odors associated with their natal stream as juveniles and then later use these retained odor memories to guide the final phases of their home stream migration. The imprinting process is critical for successful completion of the spawning migration and salmon that are transported downstream during their seaward migration (e.g. around dams) are more likely to stray to non-natal sites. <br />In this study, we are testing the utility of altering the barge environment (flow rate, novel water exposure) to improve imprinting success in a laboratory study of smolting steelhead as a cost-effective alternative/precursor for in-river barge studies. These studies will require detailed molecular and hormonal analysis of Pacific salmon olfactory physiology and gene expression that are associated with olfactory imprinting.<br />The offeror is to assist NOAA research in evaluating methods to reduce straying rates of barged juvenile steel head in the Columbia River. The goals of this work are to provide a critical analysis of factors that impact stray rates of Columbia River salmonids and develop and apply physiological markers of olfactory imprinting to assess new methods for reducing stray rates of barged Snake River steelhead.
<p>The project has two major components:</p>
<p>Comparisons of imprinting in barged vs. in-river migrants. Assist NOAA researchers with studies to assess imprinting of barged and in-river migrants by monitoring imprinting-associated changes in physiological function and gene expression as indicators of imprinting success.</p>
<p>Evaluation of alternate barging protocols to reduce straying. Assist NOAA researchers with studies to identify key environmental parameters that are important for successful imprinting in barged fish using a controlled laboratory study and monitoring imprinting associated changes in physiological function and gene expression as indicators of imprinting success.</p>
<p><br />There are five tasks required for this work. <br />1) Salmon olfactory tissue collection - Assist NOAA scientists with annual collection of tissues (olfactory rosettes, olfactory bulbs, pituitaries, gills, plasma) from migrating and barged juvenile salmon at several Columbia River locations (Lower Granite, McNary, and Bonneville Dams) and from experimental groups of salmon reared at local research hatcheries. Samples from up to 1000 fish will be collected. Sample collection will require several trips per year to the research hatchery (currently at the University of Washington Big Beef Creek Field Station) and approximately 16 days overnight in a hotel for sampling Columbia River fish. The tentative Columbia River schedule involves two four-day Barge sampling trips with hotel stays in Pullman, Washington (one night), Umatilla, Oregon (one night) and Stevenson, Washington (one night). In addition, there will be two additional Dam sampling trips involving 3 days/2 nights at McNary Dam (Umatilla) and 4 days/3 nights at Bonneville Dam (Stevenson). The Contractor must have a valid driver's license, be able to drive government vehicles, and may require access to NOAA facilities outside of regular business hours. <br />2) Analysis of olfactory gene expression related to imprinting in Pacific salmon - Assist NOAA scientists with analysis of imprinting-associated changes in gene expression as indicators of imprinting success. The contractor will isolate olfactory and brain mRNAs from up to 1000 fish, perform quantitative PCR for Pacific salmon olfactory receptor gene expression (3 ORs, 1 V1R, 1 V2R) and assist with collection and analysis 'of the olfactory transcriptome data using the Illumina platforms.<br />3) Analysis of smolting physiology related to imprinting in Pacific salmon - Assist NOAA scientists with analysis of imprinting-associated changes in physiological function as indicators of imprinting success. The contractor will conduct plasma thyroid hormone (time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay) and gill Na/K ATPase assays on up to 1000 samples.<br />4) Analysis of molecular and physiology results in the context of salmon ecology, migration and olfactory imprinting Assist NOAA scientists with interpretation of imprinting-associated changes in physiological function and gene expression relative to known patterns of salmonid imprinting, migration and general ecology.<br />5) Report and Document Deliverables- Provide results from tasks 1-3 in the form of electronic databases stored on NOAA computers. Assist NOAA scientists with project reports and preparation of manuscripts for publication in peer reviewed journals.</p>
<p>The government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the University of Washington, as we believe this is the only source with such unique expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the work. All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating the capability, expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the necessary work to:</p>
<p>Joshua Dodson, NOAA, WRAD, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA</p>

Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.

NUWC Division Newport intends to place a purchase order with Kongsberg Maritime Ltd to conduct an engineering study in order to support the CLUSTER TOPGATE Technical Refresh program.
 The first and only developer of the outboard imaging module was Kongsberg. Kongsberg designed, manufactured, and supported the Underwater Camera System (UCS) module of CLUSTER TOPGATE since the first prototype. In FY13, the CLUSTER TOPGATE tech refresh is focusing on updating two specific components of the UCS module, the camera inside the UCS and the protective dome that covers the UCS and protects the camera. Award to Kongsberg is required to meet technical and schedule requirements, going to another contractor would incur unacceptable cost and schedule impacts to the project. The Government intends to solicit in accordance with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.
 All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. FAR Part 13 procedures will be used.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S.
 Navy to procure subject items. Additional information will be provided upon the release of solicitation number N6660413Q0400, which is expected to be on or about 04 Dec 2012. NAICS code is 541330, size statndard is $35.5MIL, solicitation is unrestricted.  For information on this acquisition contact Michael H. Broomfield at 401-832-8469 or e-mail at michael.h.broomfield@navy.mil.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps and NECO. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.

<DESC>The goal of Electronic Warfare (EW) is to control the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum (EMS) by exploiting, deceiving, or denying enemy use of the spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces. To that end, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) EW Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) program invests in Science and Technology (S&amp;T) initiatives that will provide naval forces (including Navy and Marine Corps) with improved threat warning systems; Electronic warfare Support (ES); decoys and countermeasures against weapon tracking and guidance systems; Electronic Attack (EA) against adversary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Electronic Protection (EP) of our own weapons and C4ISR from intentional and unintentional interference.
<p>ONR has funded related technology development under numerous programs. If Offerors are enhancing work performed under other ONR or DoD projects, they must clearly identify the point of departure and what existing work will be brought forward and what new work will be performed under this BAA. ONR Code 312 Electronic Warfare (312EW) seeks proposals for efforts that shall develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation systems in electronic warfare.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes only. The US Army Contracting Command  New Jersey at Fort Dix is conducting market research for a System Integrator to develop and implement Increment II of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System  Army (IPPS-A). The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Army's Increment II System Integrator requirements. IPPS-A is designated a Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program under the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO). IPPS-A is a pre-Major Automated Information System (pre-MAIS) and a Defense Business System (DBS) program. It is managed by the Army Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), IPPS-A Project Management Office, in Alexandria, VA 22332. The purpose of the IPPS-A System Integrator contract is to obtain contractor services for the design, development, integration, testing, implementation, and deployment of a PeopleSoft Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, which integrates Army Business Processes and existing Army data into a single Human Resource and pay system.
Statement of Need:IPPS-A will provide integrated personnel and pay management for all components (Active, Guard and Reserve). IPPS-A will be a web-based tool, developed through the use of a COTS ERP product, available 24 hours a day, accessible to soldiers, (HR professionals, Combatant Commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army. The Army is developing IPPS-A using a hybrid solution that includes the use of PeopleSoft ERP software, third party products, and Agile Development to deliver integrated personnel and pay capabilities. IPPS-A is being developed in two Increments with multiple releases. Increment I, currently in development, will provide a single, multi-Component trusted database with reporting capabilities that will provide a single record for all Army Soldiers. Increment I will serve as a trusted data source for personnel and human resources data for the entire Army, allow for interface communications, and produce multi-Component reports. Increment I will provide the system infrastructure necessary to build Increment II and future releases.
Increment II will deliver full integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components, building on the trusted database and PeopleSoft foundation delivered by IPPS-A Increment I. IPPS-A Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. The Army will employ incremental development for Increment II, developing capabilities in 14-18 month cycles, with fielding of capabilities every 12 months. Total system functionality will be delivered across four releases: personnel accountability, including a Soldier self-service module (Release 2.0), essential personnel services (Release 3.0), pay services, including automated pay actions (Release 4.0), and remaining personnel services (Release 5.0). Each release of IPPS-A will incrementally build upon the prior releases design and capability. 
The Army will use the Army PeopleSoft 9.1 ERP and Oracle 11g database capabilities developed in Increment I, along with Application Technologies outside of the core, to meet user requirements for the total system. The IPPS-A PMO fully expects the incoming System Integrator to apply patches, bundles, and feature packs to upgrade any existing custom software prior to Increment II development. In addition, if major application releases (e.g., PeopleSoft 9.2) are generally available prior to major development activities for each IPPS-A release, the System Integrator will be expected to analyze the feasibility of applying a major application upgrade, and subsequently execute the upgrade if directed by the Government.
The Army seeks to engage a contract System Integrator for the total development and implementation of IPPS-A Increment II, from the transition of fielding support for Increment I through development of Increment II, Releases 2-5, until attainment of Full Deployment (FD) and transition to a post-deployment sustainment support contractor. The anticipated scope of the work shall include:	Program Management	Information Assurance	Application Security	Systems Engineering	Technical Architecture	Software Configuration and Development	System Integration	Data Management and Data Migration	Environment Development and Management	Disaster Recovery	Design Reviews	Life-Cycle Management	Integrated Logistics Support	Test and Evaluation	Classified Products Support	Transition
Prospective IPPS-A System Integrator contractors shall ensure that a broad range of expertise is available in the disciplines listed above in order to meet the programs requirements. Prospective contractors shall also demonstrate experience in ERP implementation, Agile and modular development, and incorporation of inventive and evolving technologies in a cost-effective and proficient manner that will advance its performance and support to the IPPS-A project. The prospective contractor shall also have knowledge of Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), Human Resources and Army Pay Systems, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) processes and operations. In addition to these standards, the IPPS-A system and data must be compliant with the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) and follow Common Human Resources Information Standards (CHRIS) from design through sustainment. A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) has been attached to this notice for a more specific description of the type of services that may be required.
Capability Statement:An interested source may provide a corporate capability statement. The statement shall explain why the source believes that it has the technical capability to meet the Governments requirements to include experience of personnel, organizational history on meeting this or similar requirements, corporate acumen in managing large ERP implementation projects and government contracts of the same or similar nature, experience implementing the products identified above, and ability to expand its workforce to perform multiple, concurrent, tasks, e.g., through teaming, hiring, internal reassignment, etc. The statement shall include the sources website address; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only); business size and applicable NAICS codes; socio-economic status; number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three Government fiscal years. The client reference must be for work relevant to this requirement performed within the last three years and include the agency supported, a client point of contact, whether the work was performed as a prime or a subcontractor, delivery date or period of performance, and a brief description of the effort.

<SUBJECT>16--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Advanced High Altitude Parachutist Oxygen Breathing System(AHAPOBS)
<SOLNBR>WARPAD-RFI-AD003

<ARCHDATE>01182013
<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495

<a href="mailto:allison.griffin@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (PADDS)</a>
<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Center, is conducting a market survey for technical information on concepts for High Altitude Parachutist Oxygen Breathing Systems.  High Altitude parachutists and aircrews need supplemental oxygen during the execution of the Ram Air parachute operations as well as during unpressurized flights. <br> The following briefly describe the Oxygen requirements: <br>   All personnel will pre-breathe 100 percent aviation grade oxygen at or below 10,000 feet MSL pressure or cabin altitude below 10,000 feet MSL pressure altitude on any mission scheduled for a drop at or above 20,000 feet MSL. <br>   The required pre-breathing time will be completed before the 20-minute warning and before the cabin altitude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL. <br>   Any break in pre-breathing requires restarting the pre-breathing period or removing the individual(s) whose pre-breathing was interrupted from the mission. <br>   Pre-breathing requires the presence of an Air Force physiological technician onboard the aircraft. <br>   All personnel onboard during unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL and higher will use oxygen. (Exception: Parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during unpressurized flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the time above 10,000 feet MSL does not exceed 30 minutes each sortie.) <br> The bailout systems require a duration of oxygen lasting from the time when the parachutist disconnects from the Pre-breathe console, thru parachute landing. Improved Ram Air Canopy systems, in particular when used in High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) parachute insertion operations, have extended and continue to extend the parachutist's time aloft.  Future insertion operations could exceed 60 minutes from aircraft exit to ground.  New Ram Air parachute systems currently in testing are expected to have descent rates averaging approximately 9 ft/sec, and can be deployed directly upon exit from the aircraft with an objective altitude of 35,000 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL). Additional aircraft race tracks and physical activities within the aircraft can cause jumpers to consume the oxygen volume needed for the descent prior to exit. <br> For jumps from 30,000 ft, the breathing system shall provide physiological protection against hypoxia from the time the parachutist disconnects from the prebreathing console to his/her landing at sea level altitude.  The system shall provide adequate breathing gas for the following profile (all flows and volumes are expressed in terms of ambient liters): <br> 40 liters per minute for 2 minutes prior to departing the aircraft. <br> 	Consumption approximating the curve as shown below represents estimated usages of oxygen in liters / min utilizing current open circuit oxygen breathing systems. Parachute opening at 28,000 ft approximately 15 seconds after aircraft departure. <br> 	Under parachute descent rate of 10 ft/sec from 28,000 ft to ground level (sea level). <br> See attached document for Parachutist's Breathing Flow Rate During Freefall and Descent. <br> Current pre-breathe consoles are connected to the parachutist's bailout system and are designed to supply the parachutist with 100% aviation grade oxygen without depleting the bailout system's volume of oxygen.  These consoles are designed to support the pre-breathe requirements of up to 6 parachutists, but in many cases the internal supply volume of the oxygen is inadequate to fully support this number of paratroopers, and in some cases additional consoles and or large  quote mark K quote mark  bottles are loaded on the aircraft to support pre-breathing needs and additional racetracks. This equipment is organic to the inserting unit, is left on board the aircraft and needs to be recovered after operations.  Operationally, this is not possible as the aircraft needs to egress in a manner as not to compromise the inserting unit's mission.  Equipment recovery in this case becomes difficult. <br> The Military Free Fall community has interest in oxygen breathing systems that will support upgraded mission capabilities of extended duration. Equipment for both pre-breathing and canopy descent phases are to be considered for upgrade to meet improved mission requirements. However, the bailout phase is of the highest priority, where size and pressure increases of current 122 cu-in, 3000 psi cylinders will not be considered. Ideal system would support both phases in one system, with a total duration of approximately four hours with a parachutist breathing rate of 20 liters/min on an open circuit breathing system. <br> Successful development could lead to additional uses for aircrews desiring the freedom to move about the back of the aircraft without an oxygen hose tethering them and restricting their movements.  Other applications may be an emergency egress breathing system (non-fire related), and possibly a smaller more efficient subsurface re-breather for military or commercial use. <br> Considerations for design: <br> * Must be able to integrate with all existing MFF parachute systems to include tandem systems (tandem master and passenger) and tethered bundle systems, and not interfere with equipment mountings. Must be compatible with current and future helmet systems to include but not limited to: Gentex, ACH, OpsCorp FAST, and Protec helmets, must not interfere with combat loads, paratrooper worn navigation systems' mounting or readability, Night Vision devices, or Heads Up Displays <br> * System <br> o Duration should be not less than 70 minutes for bailout phase, or combined pre-breath and bailout systems 3 hours Threshold and an objective of 4 hours. <br> o Bailout system size should be as small as possible. <br> o Pressure gauge should be oriented and large enough to be easily read with or without Night vision devices by the user and inspecting personnel. An additional wireless temperature compensated pressure transducer to be displayed on a navigation device a plus. <br> o Shall operate at temperatures ranging from -65 degrees F to 160 degrees F and humidity ranging from zero to 100 %, non-condensing. <br> o Shall demonstrate a functional reliability of 95% (T) to 99% (O) at a 90% confidence level. <br> o Must provide a procedure to verify functionality during pre jump and Jumpmaster Personnel Inspection (JMPI) to include tank pressure, leaks, and gas valve flow direction and functionality. <br> o Frost or ice accumulation outside the bailout oxygen storage subsystem, manifold, hose and regulator, or inside or outside the mask shall not preclude proper operation of the system.  <br> o The breathing mask shall incorporate a communication capability consistent with current communications systems. <br> o Shall incorporate self-sealing connections and non-crushable hoses where applicable. <br> o The breathing mask shall be a low-profile mask, attached to the parachutist's helmet by a secure mask suspension system that must be capable of withstanding opening shocks up to 15G's.  During movement on board the aircraft, exit, high-speed free-fall, parachute opening, descent and landing, the mask is to remain securely on the parachutist's face. <br> o Pressurized oxygen storage systems, if applicable, shall be shatterproof, rated at maximum working pressure of not more than 4500 psig and shall meet all applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) certification requirements and Department of Defense (DOD) transport aircraft flight clearance requirements.  <br>  <br> All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a White Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement 11-13 which can be found at http://www3.natick.army.mil/nsrdecbaa.html.

<DESC>If viewing this announcement from a source other than Federal Aviation Administration Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website, please visit http://faaco.faa.gov/ for the original announcement.  Updates and or amendments will only be issued at http://faaco.faa.gov/.
The purpose of this Request for Offers is to seek competent and qualified contractors to perform all work necessary to replace the chiller control panels on all 4 chillers at the Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) located in Auburn, Washington in accordance with the specifications, drawings, contract clauses, and wage rates.   Magnitude of base construction is $100,000 - $250,000
The NAICS Code for this project is 238220.  SIR is open to all bidders Large and Small.  
The total contract duration for completion of all work shall be 45 calendar days after official notice to proceed for construction.
The following is a general description of the work: There are four (4) existing Trane 320 ton chillers installed in the Seattle ARTCC.  These chillers were installed in the early to mid-1990 and their control panels are obsolete types which are current not supported by the manufacturer.  These control panels are to be replaced with the newest variant of the Trane Adaptiview Control Panel Package.  This package is to contain the newest display, UC 800 Controller, mounting swing arm and the new control panel. Included in this project is the connection and full integration of the new control panel system with the facility's DDC system which consists of the Johnson Control's Metasys System.  The panels shall be programmed with all communication units of the English format and not the Metric format.  For example, Degree F shall be used not Degree C. Also included in this statement of work is the replacement of the conduit and wiring system of the Johnson Control's Metasys System to the three older Trane Chillers (CH 100, CH 400 and CH 500).  A single conduit may be run to the ceiling above these chillers; however, from this location three (3) separate conduits shall be run from this point to each of the three older chillers.  Chiller 200 is the newest of the four (4) chillers and is not included with the re-conduit and re-wiring effort.  The existing wiring and conduit for Chiller 200 may be re-used if possible.  The existing, old wiring shall be removed from the existing conduit for Chiller 100, Chiller 400 and Chiller 500.  This wiring is not to be abandoned in place.  This work shall be accomplished by JCI. The Tracer TU Service Tool shall be provided for work on the panels. Any and all associated work required to install and return the four chillers to full operation is included in this work.  This associated work includes but is not limited to removal and replacement of the control panels, removal and replacement of the refrigerant charge, marking and revisions to the control system wiring, removal and replacement of existing sensors, transducers, brackets, required pressure and vacuum testing, required or recommended oil changes and refrigerant dryer servicing.  A certified trained technician shall perform this work.  The refrigerant technician shall have the qualifications and requirements, as specified in the Federal Clean Air Act and FAA Order 1050.18.

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW)<br />FSI/EX/REG Online English Learning Instruction and Support
<p><strong>Instructions to Contractors:&nbsp;<br /><br />Please see&nbsp;SOW&nbsp;below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a Capability Statement to&nbsp;address your ability to meet the requirements of the SOW.&nbsp;Included in your submission should be the vendor's Socioeconomic Size Standard, DUNS and Estimated Price.&nbsp; The Capability Statement shall be emailed to Kate Johnson at </strong><a href="mailto:ZeuschnerkE@state.gov"><strong>ZeuschnerkE@state.gov</strong></a><strong>, and must not exceed 4 MB.&nbsp; </strong><a href="mailto:ZeiscjmerLE@NOTE"><strong>NOTE</strong></a><strong>:&nbsp;DO NOT send proposals, this is a&nbsp;Sources Sought not a Solicitation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's Foreign Service Institute is Federal Government's training institution. It is responsible for providing opportunities for officers and support personnel of the U.S. foreign affairs community to prepare for work as American diplomats and other professions in the advancement of U.S. foreign affairs both domestically and abroad. Under the HR LOB/HRD, FSI has been designated as the preferred eLearning content provider for agencies requiring training content for the foreign affairs community. USAID is one such federal agency making use of these services in their solicitation for commercially-produced online English language services.</p>
<p>Many of USAID's staff positions overseas require a certain level of business English. Classroom training was found to be cost prohibitive. Individual USAID missions sought to partner with dozens of different vendors worldwide, resulting in inconsistent training outcomes that were impossible to measure. While USAID regularly hires local staff with a basic understanding of English derived from traditional schooling, such training must be supplemented with business-level training, which includes USAID-specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />On behalf of USAID, the Foreign Service Institute is in search of a language training vendor that provides annual subscriptions for a library of English language instruction and support which can interoperate with the agency's in-house learning management system. This collection should be customizable so as to satisfy most of the basic and mandatory language training required for employees to maintain and enhance those English skills required for many USAID positions. All work performed by the contractor under this Statement of Work (SOW) shall be subject to the technical direction, approval and oversight of FSI's Contracting Officer (CO) and the authorized Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>Requirements<br />This language learning tool should provide on-demand support of various professional tasks performed in English such as composing emails, getting translation support, etc. Features must include graphics, animation, applets, music, video, and audio. It should also include a skills proficiency measurement tool; such assessment tool must have the ability to be administered by USAID staff, not by an outside testing vendor.</p>
<p>The program must include an administrative system which allows USAID to assign one "administrator" to oversee the program on a worldwide scale, while concurrently, in-country staff can identify users and monitor usage within their post. Such a structure will allow the administration of a global program that spans over 50 countries and 700 concurrent users. The number of localized interfaces should be sufficient enough to ensure that the majority of USAID's users are able to navigate the service in their native language.</p>
<p>USAID has a litany of words and acronyms that are specific to the organization. These words and acronyms are not anything a new hire will have learned about in previous careers, and are especially confusing to non-native English speakers. The system must have a customizable word/acronym program which houses organization-specific vocabulary in a central repository with a global reach.</p>
<p>The program should be Windows and Mac compatible. Content should have the flexibility of either being loaded into a proprietary learning management system or being "portalled" through such a system to the provider's site.</p>
<p>The system should be able to generate activity reports which provide the following data:</p>
<p>&bull; Top Users<br />&bull; Overall User Progress<br />&bull; Summary of User Activity (e.g., active/inactive; usage by language level; new user access)</p>
<p>Delivery<br />The contractor must deliver online course content as outlined above to the following:</p>
<p>U.S. Agency for International Development<br />Ronald Reagan Building<br />Washington, D.C. 20523-1000<br />Attention: Elizabeth G Hamly (FSI)</p>
<p>Government-Furnished Property<br />N/A</p>
<p>Security Requirements<br />N/A</p>
<p>Place of Performance<br />Same as delivery</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />On or about January 30, 2013 - January 29, 2014</p>

At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP will not be entertained. <br> 2.0 SUBJECT: The Pharmaceutical Systems Project Management Office (PSPMO) of the U.S. Army Medical Material Development Activity (USAMMDA) is conducting market research to assess the maturity and commercial availability of products capable of satisfying the capability gap for diagnosis of dengue infection. In order to satisfy this capability gap, the PSPMO seeks to develop and field candidate products that meet or exceed the specifications provided in Attachment 1. Of note is the Key performance parameter (KPP) of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance. Commensurate with this goal, the PSPMO wishes to obtain information from commercial sources that possess candidate dengue diagnostic products capable of meeting (or have met) the KPP and that are capable of performing within or above the specifications provided in Attachment 1. Respondents should describe only those candidates that: <br> Are capable of satisfying the specifications provided in Attachment 1 <br> Are currently marketed or currently in development <br> Have a minimum maturity level equal to (at least) demonstrated proof-of-concept in a well controlled bench performance study. <br> 3.0 Background: Dengue Fever infection is the second ranked infectious disease priority of the US Military. Development of a dengue diagnostic capability for use in a deployed setting is but one materiel solution being considered in the family of systems approach toward dengue infections. In the absence of approved drugs and vaccines, prevention and early diagnosis remain the best option to mitigate the impact of dengue infection in US troops. Toward this end, the PSPMO assessing the commercial market for candidate dengue diagnostic products capable of fulfilling the capability gap.  <br> At a minimum, dengue diagnostic system candidates must meet the threshold parameters shown in Attachment 1. Ideal candidates will meet or exceed the objective parameters listed in Attachment 1. At minimum, candidates must have demonstrated proof-of-concept in a well controlled bench performance study. A preferred candidate is FDA-cleared or is capable of achieving FDA clearance within 3-years. Candidate tests or technologies must be usable in an austere environment, preferably without the requirement for electricity or for ancillary laboratory equipment not provided with the diagnostic test. It is preferred that the candidate will be usable by medical personnel (such as a medic or physician assistant) without specialized medical laboratory technician training (i.e., the test is CLIA-waived or capable of being CLIA-waived). In addition to technical performance, the PSPMO is also interested in several non-technical characteristics. Respondents should address these items as explained in Section 4.0 <br> 4.0 Response Instructions:  <br> Respondents should address the following in their submission: <br> Name and address of company <br> Names and contact information of key company personnel <br> Description of proposed candidate(s), to include: <br> o Name of proposed candidate(s) <br> o Intended Use or proposed intended use <br> o Technical Description: A thorough technical description explaining the technology utilized and manufacturing methods used. <br> o Description of Packaging/Kit: Either current or proposed.

If not yet FDA-cleared, please specify an estimated time frame required to achieve FDA clearance. Describe, as well, the testing performed and summary of results obtained throughout development of the candidate to include (but not limited to): bench performance, clinical performance, cross-reactivity, matrix equivalency, etc. <br> Product Development Plan. This plan does not need to be highly detailed. However, the plan should depict major activities required to obtain FDA clearance and approximate timeframes (calendar year and quarter). Please include any required clinical performance studies, briefly describing (at minimum) the following: region/study site location, number of subjects, study groups. Also include a description of any bench performance studies, indicating laboratory site(s) that will be utilized. Please indicate if you are interested/need to utilize USAMRMC laboratory or clinical sites. <br> Sustainability Plan. Briefly describe the market for your product (both in the Continental US and abroad) to include projected US and foreign sales. Please expand on the cost-effectiveness of achieving FDA licensure for your proposed candidate(s), indicating if and how the candidate will be profiAttachment and sustainable.  <br> Needs. In accordance with the provided development plan, respondents should provide information on their projected needs from the DoD; i.e., what they would expect the PSPMO to supply in terms of resources (by development plan activity, not the dollar amount), clinical sites, scientific expertise, materials, etc. in order to achieve the KPP of US FDA-clearance.  <br> Narrative. Explain the following: <br> o Willingness and ability to serve as the regulatory sponsor (510(k) holder) for the candidate  <br> o Willingness/interest in co-developing dengue diagnostic candidates with the DoD <br> o Description of what may be provided to facilitate product development (by the respondent). Ex: Clinical site(s), scientific expertise, provision of product candidates in adequate supplies to support development, regulatory support, manufacturing, etc.  <br> o Projected US and foreign market <br> o Willingness to achieve FDA clearance with proposed candidate(s) <br> o Description/explanation of availability and/or development of external positive controls, which will be required for fielding. <br> o Willingness to pursue CLIA-waived status of the capability - provided that the clinical performance proves adequate to achieve CLIA-waived status, please comment on if your market analysis and supportability assessments provide adequate cost-benefit to pursuit of CLIA-waiver and if pursuit would be within your strategic plans. <br> 5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION: Any and all questions related to this RFI shall <br> be directed to Michael Ursone at 301-619-9525.

<DESC><strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong>. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of an award. The United States Mint is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.
<p>It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, singled-spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the requested services. The following shall be included in the capabilities statement:</p>
<p>(1) Relevant Experience, no more than two (2) projects, to include experience in performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last five years, including contract number, indication of whether a prime or subcontractor, contract value. No more than two relevant projects shall be submitted; and,</p>
<p>(2) Company profile to include number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number and CAGE Code.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND: <br /><br /></strong>The United States Mint at West Point currently encapsulates approximately 1.8 million coins annually at West Point Facility. After the striking operation, numismatic coins are encapsulated by manual insertion into a plastic capsule,which is then placed into a display case. The United States Mint at West Point seeks to automate the numismatic encapsulation process. The automated system will be utilized to process gold, silver, and platinum numismatic products exclusively.<br /><br />The current encapsulation process consists of a process where each coin is encapsulated in-between two capsules, a top and bottom capsule, and assembled on the bottom capsule tray. Coins are nested into the bottom capsule obverse-up, with acrylic capsules varying in diameter and thickness. Capsule trays vary in quantity depending on the denomination that is being processed, but once the tray is fully populated, it is then automatically routed for use in a pick and place operation. The United States Mint's quality standard requires that there be no visible dust, marks, abrasions, or scratches on coins or capsules. <br /><br /><strong>SPECIFICATION: <br /><br /></strong>This specification covers a turn-key, self-contained system to automate the encapsulation process for Mint coins. The United States Mint at West Point requires an automated encapsulation unit as a secondary unit to add capacity to an existing unit that is in use at West Point, however, space is at a premium at the United States Mint at West Point, and it is of utmost importance that this unit comply with specified United States Mint constraints. The encapsulation system must accommodate a minimum run rate, fit within a specified amount of space, and must require no more than two employees to operate the equipment. The automated system must not interfere with the United States Mint ongoing production requirements. The second automated encapsulation unit must be as similar design to the first unit as much as possible.</p>
<p>The United States Mint at West Point seeks a systems integrator that can provide a turnkey project. The contractor shall provide proof of concept, fabrication, assembly, factory test, delivery, installation, start-up, Mint test, training, documentation, and spare parts for the automated encapsulation system. All equipment, system design, software, controls, programming and debugging shall be the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The United States Mint intends to a release a Draft RFP within the next 120 days. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the United States Mint to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the United States Mint will arise as a result of Contractor submission of responses to this notice or the United States Mint use of such information. The United States Mint reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any Contractor's input resulting from this notice. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Data submitted in response to this notice will not be returned.</p>
<p>To be responsive to this announcement a Contractor must supply their information as requested by 2:00 PM (EST) Friday, 07 December 2012 as a Microsoft Word document.<br /><br />The package shall be sent by e-mail to the following address: Cecily.Dennis@usmint.treas.gov</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address:<br />United States Mint, ATTN: C.Dennis, 801 9th Street NW, Washington, DC 20220.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

Comprehensive Assessment of VA's Orthotic and Prosthetic Services

The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to gather capabilities and market information pertinent for acquisition planning.  The agency does not intend to award a contract through this RFI.  The responses to this RFI may contribute to the development of a solicitation and contract.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

The VA seeks to obtain advisory and technical consultative services to conduct a comprehensive assessment of VA's Orthotic and Prosthetic (O&P) services.  The comprehensive assessment will include: evaluation of current O&P capabilities within VA; assessment of Veterans' needs regarding O&P services; identification and assessment of success, gaps, and risks; and, recommendations for maximizing opportunities and becoming a leading O&P service organization.  
Scope:  The scope of this requirement is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of VA's O&P services to include evaluation of current O&P capabilities within VA, assessment of Veterans' needs, identification and assessment of success, gaps, and risks, and recommendations for maximizing opportunities.    
Background:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the leading provider of O&P services with more than 60 locations for the custom fabrication and fitting of the latest state-of-the-art O&P componentry.  VHA also contracts with more than 600 vendors with accredited O&P providers to ensure access to care is near the Veteran's home.  VHA is fully committed to providing optimal care and cutting-edge orthotic and prosthetic technology to Veterans with needs.  
In March 2012, VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) audited VHA's management and acquisition of prosthetic limbs and provided recommendations.  One of the OIG findings was that VA does not have a good understanding of current capabilities of their O&P services, or if VA is sufficiently meeting the needs of Veterans through the combination of VA services and contracted care.  Based on this finding, OIG recommended that VA identify and assess the adequacy of VA's in-house fabrication capabilities for prosthetic limbs.  In order to ensure that VA provides high quality and cost efficient O&P services, VA intends to assess: (1) the adequacy of in-house fabrication capabilities, (2) Veterans' O&P needs, and (3) the capabilities and capacity of VA's O&P services as a whole.
VA OIG Report can be found at: http://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-11-02254-102.pdf 
Tasks to be performed by the selected Contractor:  
The Government is contemplating the solicitation and award of a single contract or task order to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the VA's O&P services and perform tasks and provide the deliverables listed below.  The intent is for the Contractor to take a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to assess O&P services.  The Government anticipates the Contractor to have extensive knowledge in O&P, VA systems, and program evaluation skills to successfully perform this service.

Special Notice

Synopsis: 

Pursuant to FAR 8.402(f) , subsequent to OIG Report No. 09-01784-146 , and in accordance with the initiative to standardize the leasing of Endoscopes and related equipment implemented per VHA Directive 2009-004, VHA Handbook 1761.1 and the 4/19/2010 DUSHOM (10N) (WebCIMS No. 451818) memo, notice is given that VA NY/NJ Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN3) intends to add the following scope series and ancillary equipment  via modification to our existing VISN-wide FSS-BPA (VA243-BP-0151) awarded against Olympus America Inc. FSS Schedule contract (VA797P-2065D):

BF Series	Bronchoscopes
CY Series	Cystoscopes
ENF series	 Rhinolaryngoscope
LF Series	Tracheal Fiberscope
M3 Series	Autoclavable Telescope
MR Series	 Ureteroscope
URF series	 Flexible Ureteroscope
WA5 Series	Laparoscopes
 
This proposed modification is in furtherance of a VHA goal to standardize leasing of Endoscopes (includes GI and flexible fiber optic endoscopy). Implementation of this initiative to date has resulted in reduced variability in the number of different SOPs required for endoscope setup and RME, thus reducing the potential for user error and enhancing patient safety. 

This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. 

No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 8 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed BPA modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a separate competitive procurement. 

Requests for information and resultant responses shall be submitted directly to 
the contracting officer, Christopher Ward at Christopher.Ward@va.gov or by Fax: at (718) 741-4722

NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative ideas that may support a potential new DARPA program designed to provide novel approaches to non-invasive imaging technologies that allow visualization of morphology and characterization of function of a single or group of cells in a living organism (in situ).  DARPA is especially interested in novel imaging and measurement methods that utilize modalities that have not been applied to clinical biological imaging.  Submissions to this RFI should propose a novel technology or a combination of technologies, and should outline the necessary technical areas in which research would be needed in order to develop the proposed technology.

<SUBJECT>GST0009AJM094 ISC2 Task Order Ceiling Increase
<SOLNBR>GST0009AJM094
<RESPDATE>120412
<CONTACT>Victor B. Angkico, Contracting Officer, Phone (360) 779-4879, Email victor.angkico@gsa.gov
<DESC><p>GSA FEDSIM intends to increase the ceiling of the current Infrastructure Support Contract (ISC2) task order (GS00T99ALD0211/GST0009AJM094) in support of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Department of Information Technology (DIT). This task order was competitively awarded to SRA International, Inc 4300 Fair Lakes Court, Fairfax, VA 22033 in September 2009. The ceiling increase modification will utilize the procedures of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The proposed modification ceiling increase will raise the total task order amount from the current ceiling of $457,802,950, to an amount deemed necessary to cover services under the current option period for eight months from January 1, 2013 to August 31, 2013.</p>
<p>The ISC2 task order&nbsp;covers the day-to-day operation of FDIC's infrastructure facilities, hardware, software, and systems. ISC2 currently supports 11,757 IT users and 1,159 servers. It primarily supports Operational Security, Client Support/Help Desk, Data Center Operations, Asset Management, and Systems Engineering service areas. ISC2 directly provides the support activities that facilitate FDIC's delivery of software applications by managing the underlying infrastructure, supporting release management, and providing operations and maintenance of the Development, Quality Assurance, Testing, Production, and Disaster Recovery environments. In addition to providing IT administration, management and provisioning services for all FDIC locations, it also provides a mechanism to facilitate the procurement of IT hardware and software resources to meet corporate goals of rapid response during emergencies. The services provided by this task order are a critical component of FDIC's capability to respond to banking surge activities in a timely and secure manner.</p>
<p>FEDSIM competitively awarded the follow-on contract to ISC2 (ie. ISC3) on October 12, 2012, utilizing the GSA Alliant GWAC vehicle. As a result, FEDSIM and FDIC anticipated transition completion prior to the expected current ISC2 ceiling exhaustion date of December 31, 2012; however due to a post-award protest received on October 22, 2012 there will be insufficient ceiling to maintain continuity of operations until a successful transition can be executed from ISC2 to ISC3. Due to the time to resolve the protest, this ceiling increase request is projected to cover costs through August 31, 2013.</p>
<p>SRA International is the only contractor who can ensure continuity of services with the minimal risk to the Government during this period as they have the infrastructure and staff already in place under an existing task order whose current option does not expire until August 31, 2013. The Government is legally precluded from having these services performed by any other contractor until final resolution of the GAO protest.</p>
<p>The final Justification &amp; Approval supporting this sole source action will be posted on FedBizOpps within 14 days after contract modification award, expected to be on or about December 31, 2012.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought/Request for Information-Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B) Construction and Design-Build (D-B) Construction, Honshu (Excluding Okinawa and Hokkaido), Japan. This is a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. This is not a solicitation for proposals. The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this market survey.  <br> The U.S. Army Engineer District-Japan is planning to solicit a MATOC for D-B-B and D-B construction to support U.S. Government facilities in the Honshu area of Japan, excluding Okinawa and Hokkaido. Any solicitations pursued are intended for local sources only. Local sources are those sources physically located and licensed to conduct business in Japan. A MATOC is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for construction services with multiple awardees. Actual work is awarded through the issuance of task orders. Multiple awardees generally compete with each other for task orders. There are some exceptions to this rule, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders are issued non-competitively to one contract holder. The Government anticipates award of up to six contracts under each MATOC to experienced sources capable of performing a wide range of D-B-B and D-B construction projects including, but not limited to: grading, water lines, sewer lines, paving/repaving roadways, painting, roofing, renovation of interiors of existing buildings, new building construction, structural construction, Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and components, refrigeration systems, fire suppression systems, fuel pipeline and storage systems, power and services supplies, distribution and utilization systems (including lighting), power generators and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS), public address systems, fire alarm systems, telephone systems, asbestos, lead based paint, and petroleum-contaminated material abatement and disposal. Each MATOC will consist of a one-year base period and three (3) one-year option periods. The total maximum amount the Government will order under all three contracts combined is the not-to-exceed- amount of 2,000,000,000 Japanese YEN per period. The guaranteed minimum amount for each contract's base period and each option period exercised is 500,000 Japanese YEN. A performance bond will be required for individual task order that is over the Japanese YEN equivalent of $150,000. Therefore, the Government intends to require contractors to demonstrate bonding capacity of 2,000,000,000 Japanese YEN. The minimum task order amount is 100,000 Japanese YEN. The maximum task order amount is 2,000,000,000 Japanese YEN. Task orders issued under these contracts will be D-B-B or D-B in nature. For D-B-B task orders, the Government will provide the contractor with full design. For D-B task orders, contractor may be required to produce engineering designs ranging from shop-drawings to full designs in accordance with Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS) depending on the complexity of the task order. The Government will provide the contractor with a project scope varying from a general scope of work with no drawings to a complete statement of work with design up to 90 percent. Contractor designs will be conducted after award of a task order in accordance with both U.S. and Japanese design standards. The contractor will be required to provide licensed professional designers having qualifications that meet contract requirements. <br> QUALIFICATIONS OF DESIGNERS (Excerpt from Section 01012, Design After Award): All design professionals shall have current registration to practice in the United States or Japan; however, there may be particular task orders involving Fire Protection design and specifically requiring U.S. Professional Registration.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Holly Knott, Contract Specialist (Contractor), e-mail: holly.b.knott.ctr@us.army.mil <br /><br />The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6). This is a Sole Source Justification for a VIO 300D Electrosurgical Unit with APC2 Argon Plasma Coagulator for the 10th Medical Group, United States Air Force Academy, Colorado. ERBE USA Incorporated is the only company that offers a cautery with Argon that will fit in the spaces designated for Gastroenterology procedures. Using Argon to remove large polyps is the highest standard of care. If a unit without Argon is purchased the chances of leaving cells that could potentially be cancerous is more probable. The patient may be required to repeat their procedure sooner to verify that all of the polyp or abnormal cells were removed. This may cause undue harm to the patient along with an increase in hospital fees due to repeat procedures.

Notice of Intent to Sole Source Evidence-Based Medicine & Evidence-Based Management Conference 
This notice of intent is informational only and is neither a request for quote nor a solicitation of proposals.  However, parties identifying their interest and capability to respond to the requirement must show clear and convincing evidence within fifteen (15) calendar days that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates an ability to meet the agency's needs.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses is solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Be advised that costs incurred with responses are at the contractor's discretion and the Government will not provide reimbursement for such costs.  Information can be sent to Wendy Kwong, email: Wendy.Kwong1@va.gov.  All responses must be received no later than 2:00 pm/Eastern Standard Time on 30 November 2012.  No telephone or mail inquiries will be accepted.  

The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to solicit with only one source, under FAR authority 6.302 for commercial items with Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI), 5200 Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462-1298.  ECRI is providing an expert conference that specializes in evidence-based medicine and evidence-based management in policy and practice pertaining to the examination of systemness within healthcare delivery.  The conference provided by ECRI is considered unique based on their comprehensive reporting and independent insight into the US healthcare system procedures and adverse event incidence which conveys strategic relevance of the examination design needed to develop questions for speakers.  ECRI has proprietary rights to the applied research information and is an independent, nonprofit organization.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would occur.
 
FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  ECRI is the only known local source available to satisfy this current need.

Length of service <br> includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or <br> successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the <br> performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) <br>  <br> HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther <br> King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, <br> Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A <br> contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay <br> in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR <br> 4.174) <br>  <br> THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE <br> FOLLOWING: <br>  <br> 1)	Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category. <br>  <br> ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** <br>  <br> If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract <br> (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state <br> or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by <br> laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by <br> an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the <br> wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance <br> with the following standards as compliance: <br>  <br> The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an <br> adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the <br> actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance <br> is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors <br> subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide <br> collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the <br> furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all <br> employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 <br> cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are <br> made of  quote mark wash and wear quote mark  materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other <br> personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry <br> cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the <br> cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, <br> by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement <br> that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. <br>  <br> The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the <br>  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations quote mark , Fifth Edition, April 2006, <br> unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the <br> Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at <br> http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) <br> Web site at http://wdol.gov/. <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard <br> Form 1444 (SF 1444)} <br>  <br> Conformance Process: <br>  <br> The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which <br> is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the <br> work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage <br> determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable <br> relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted <br> classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such <br> conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished <br> the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be <br> initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such <br> unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or <br> fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. <br> {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a <br> contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to <br> which a class(es) is to be conformed. <br>  <br> The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: <br>  <br> 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed <br> occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). <br>  <br> 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in <br> order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for <br> each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed <br> wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of <br> the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no <br> authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be <br> submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted <br> class(es) of employees performs any contract work. <br>  <br> 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a <br> report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent <br> information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the <br> Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of <br> Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). <br>  <br> 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or <br> disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or <br> notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to <br> process the request. <br>  <br> 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the <br> contractor. <br>  <br> 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. <br>  <br> Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond <br> paper. <br>  <br> When preparing a conformance request, the  quote mark Service Contract Act Directory of <br> Occupations quote mark  (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure <br> that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in <br> the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required <br> tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage <br> determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or <br> subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. <br>  <br> REQUIRED RESPONSE DATE: Quotes MUST be received by Thursday, November 22nd, 2012. Electronic submissions via email or facsimile (fax) will be accepted. If you An official authorized to bind your company shall sign the quote. Questions concerning this solicitation should be addressed to Jake Perrotta, Contract Specialist, via email at jake.r.perrotta.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6-Acquisitions of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation SP3300-13-Q-0007 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-61 Effective 15 Oct 2012, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DPN 20120906 effective 06 Sep 2012, and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2013-07. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>This acquisition is unrestricted to business size. For informational purposes only, the Product Service Code (PSC) is 6140 and associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335911 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This is a brand name acquisition for Motorola NNTN4436 rechargeable batteries for the Motorola XTS 5000 hand-held radio. Only Motorola NNTN4436 rechargeable batteries will meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification:<br />DLA Distribution Susquehanna Pennsylvania (DDSP) Acquisitions (J7), 2001 Mission Drive, New Cumberland, PA 17070 has a requirement from DDSP KA, K1, and K2 work centers to procure 350 Motorola brand NNTN4436 rechargeable batteries for its Distribution Centers in New Cumberland, PA and Mechanicsburg, PA.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being restricted to brand name Motorola in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), only one brand will meet the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Motorola NNTN4436 rechargeable batteries for the Motorola XTS 5000 hand-held radio are used in the DDSP KA, K1, and K2 work centers that maintain the base-wide radio communications network for the New Cumberland and Mechanicsburg warehouses. Ongoing support from Motorola is critical to the success of maintaining the radio communications. Any alternative solution would require the entire radio communication system to be replaced at an unnecessary additional cost and lengthy delay to the mission. The batteries must be compatible with the existing hand-held radio systems for warehouse personnel to accomplish their mission. For technical reasons, Motorola is the only known manufacturer that has this compatibility. Therefore, it is determined that Motorola is the only brand capable of meeting the government's requirements without substantial cost and unacceptable delay to the mission. Market research revealed many independent Motorola resellers that are qualified to provide the batteries specified in this requirement.<br /><br />The requirement consists of the following:</p>

<p>Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.<br /><br />Payment for supplies under this order will be made by the Acquisition Operations Office via the Government Purchase Card (VISA). NOTE: Since all payments under this purchase order will be made via the Government Purchase Card, the Contractor must accept the VISA Purchase Card for payment of all supplies ordered under this purchase order.<br /><br />The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>
<p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR).</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.<br />(End of provision)<br /><br />OFFER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS.

However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - All items with 21 days after date of contract award.<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.<br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items with _____ days after date of contract award.<br /><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. <br />As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: <br />OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) <br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within _____60 days provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least _____ 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. <br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. <br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed __3 years.
<p>52.222-4 Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act-Overtime Compensation. <br />As prescribed in 22.305, insert the following clause: <br />CONTRACT WORK HOURS AND SAFETY STANDARDS ACT-OVERTIME COMPENSATION (JULY 2005) <br />(a) Overtime requirements.

The responsible Contractor and subcontractor are liable for unpaid wages if they violate the terms in paragraph (a) of this clause. In addition, the Contractor and subcontractor are liable for liquidated damages payable to the Government. The Contracting Officer will assess liquidated damages at the rate of $10 per affected employee for each calendar day on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime wages required by the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. <br />(c) Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The Contracting Officer will withhold from payments due under the contract sufficient funds required to satisfy any Contractor or subcontractor liabilities for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. If amounts withheld under the contract are insufficient to satisfy Contractor or subcontractor liabilities, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments from other Federal or federally assisted contracts held by the same Contractor that are subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. <br />(d) Payrolls and basic records. <br />(1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall maintain payrolls and basic payroll records for all laborers and mechanics working on the contract during the contract and shall make them available to the Government until 3 years after contract completion. The records shall contain the name and address of each employee, social security number, labor classifications, hourly rates of wages paid, daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid. The records need not duplicate those required for construction work by Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3) implementing the Davis-Bacon Act. <br />(2) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall allow authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to inspect, copy, or transcribe records maintained under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor also shall allow authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer or Department of Labor to interview employees in the workplace during working hours. <br />(e) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the provisions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause in subcontracts that may require or involve the employment of laborers and mechanics and require subcontractors to include these provisions in any such lower tier subcontracts. The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance by any subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal. Please reference solicitation number HSTS07-13 -R-00002 on all correspondence.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued as Total Small Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 611699.</p>
<p>This combined solicitation/synopsis is for the purchase of range services on an established/existing range in accordance with the following requirements. <br /><br />Services anticipated January 1, 2013.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training. NOTE: THE RANGE MUST BE AN ESTABLISHED RANGE; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO BUILD A RANGE. The range shall be within a 20 mile radius of Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:</p>
<p>DHS personnel will use the range 6 days per quarter. DHS requires exclusive use of the range in 4 hour blocks. The range will be closed to the public during the hours that DHS uses the range. DHS will provide all ammunition, targets, and firearms instructors. DHS firearms instructors will act as safety officers and call all courses of fire on the range without oversight from range staff.</p>
<p>If the range is indoors, the range must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA regulations. The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and maximum of 25 yards. The range must possess and maintain all target retention devices. The range will have a designated firearms cleaning area. The range operator will be responsible for all lead recovery at the range, and removal of all waste materials from the range and the weapons cleaning area. Spent brass casings will be cleaned up at the end of each session by DHS personnel and put in range supplied containers. Brass will be the property of DHS unless specifically given to the range for recycling.</p>
<p>The range shall be equipped with men's and women's restroom facilities with running water for DHS use. The range shall provide adequate parking to accommodate at least 25 vehicles. <br />The range must be able to accommodate .380, 9mm, .40 S&amp;W, and .357 SIG caliber duty and training (frangible) ammunition. The range rules must allow movement between firing points and will not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (e.g. standing to kneeling transitions, stepping behind cover). The range rules will allow students to draw and fire from the holster. The range rules will not disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, including conducting lateral movements between target points. Range rules will not disallow students from performing multiple and rapid-fire drills.</p>
<p>Price Factors</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options. Options will evaluated at time of award. Pricing must be quoted on a monthly basis for aforementioned 6 days per quarter/4 hour blocks. Pricing for the base year and 4 term option years must be submitted as follows:</p>
<p>Base Year and Four Options:</p>
<p>Base Year :</p>

<p>January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2014 = _____________(monthly rate)<br />X 12 months=____________________per year<br /><br />Option Year Two</p>
<p>January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2015 = _____________(monthly rate)<br />X 12 months=___________________per year</p>

<p>Option Year Four:<br />January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2017=_______________(monthly rate)<br />X 12 months=_____________per year</p>
<p><br />Offerors are reminded to submit pricing for all years. A proposal submitted without pricing for a base and four one year term options will be considered technically non-responsive and may be removed from consideration for award.</p>
<p>Contractors will be permitted to bill on a monthly basis for hours used during the month. Invoice to be submitted only once a month.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order and may award without discussions. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation only if it can be determined that the responsible offerors proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will provide the most advantageous solution to the Government requirement, considering price and other factors. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract in response to this solicitation if it determines that none of the offers received provide the best value to the Government. In such a case, the Government will not be liable for any bid or proposal costs.</p>
<p><br />The offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Aug 2009), with its quote. An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p><br />The following clauses are also applicable to this acquisition:</p>

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP)
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE.  THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER.  WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION, WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENTS REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE.  THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER
2297-HV02	2. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
C-130	3. ESTIMATED AMOUNT (OVER $2,500 BUT NOT EXCEEDING $100,000)

4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE.

Modification of RT-1341(V)3/ARC190, P/N: 622-4956-103 to an RT-1341(V)8/ARC190, P/N: 622-5985-001. The TR-1341(V)8/ARC190 is used on the HC-130H and HC130J Aircraft as the Primary High Frequency Communication Radio. 

5. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED.
The RT-1341(V)3/ARC190, P/N: 622-4956-103 and the RT-1341(V)8/ARC190, P/N: 622-5985-001 are manufactured by Rockwell Collins, Inc. located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The RT-1341(V)3/ARC190 is used currently by the HC130H model aircraft and the RT-1341(V)8/ARC 190 is currently used by the HC130J model aircraft and the HC130H aircraft modified with the Avionics Block One Upgrade. The RT-1341(V)3/ARC190 is an older version of the RT-1341(V)8/ARC190. Both radios have been installed on the HC130H and J model aircraft as part of their original equipment configuration at the time of purchase of the HC130 Coast Guard fleet. The USCG does not intend to replace this system on either aircraft. Rockwell Collins is the sole manufacture of the RT-1341(V)8/ARC190 Modification Kit, P/N: 752-5559-001 used to upgrade the RT-1341(V)3/ARC190. Rockwell Collins does not sell this kit to any other source and is the only authorized vender to install this kit. Rockwell Collins is the OEM. They hold the engineering data, specifications, and drawings required to modify this radio. 

 
6. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES

Rockwell Collins, Inc is the OEM. Rockwell Collins is the only supplier of the RT-1341(V)8/ ARC190 Modification Kit, P/N: 752-5559-001. Rockwell Collins owns the technical data and drawings necessary to perform this work as the OEM. Market research did not indicate that any other sources were available. 

 
7. EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

The Coast Guard did not purchase the technical data and drawing necessary to support this work. Rockwell Collins, Inc. is the OEM for this material. Any additional market research is not expected to produce different results.

8. PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED.  IF THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON ACTION TO A PREVIOUSLY COMPETED ACTION, SO STATE.
The USCG does not have the required data or drawings to overcome the sole source barrier to competition. It would not be cost effective to acquire the drawings and data package in order to compete this requirement. The RT-1341(V)8/ARC190 Modification Kit is manufactured solely by Rockwell Collins. The Coast Guard will maintain open communication with Rockwell Collins and will continue market research to identify possible sources capable of providing this equipment modification service.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Questions about the chiller: <br /><br /></strong>1. What is the heat load (how much heat are we removing from the<br />laser, expressed in Watts)</p>
<p>2. What is the set point (what temperature is the chiller water<br />set at<br />as it enters the application)</p>
<p>3. Pressure requirement or pressure range of the application</p>
<p>4. Flow Rate (amount of water Liters or Gallons per minute<br />required to<br />cool the laser)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer: <br /></strong><br />This solicitation is for specifically a laser. IF the laser requires a separate chiller to operate, the chiller should be included and should have adequate capacity to cool the laser being supplied to operation in all its available operating modes.</p>
<p>The vendors applying for this solicitation should be first concerned about providing an excellent laser source as outlined in the requirements, and then provide a chiller if said laser needs one.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation shall not be issued. This requirement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is code 333314, Size Standard 500 employees.
<p><br />Solicitation number F2KBAD2212A002 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61, Effective 15 Oct 2012.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the following:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: High Sensitivity Optical Imager<br /><br />The optical imager must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; 1" or larger scientific grade-1 back-illuminated bare CCD detector with 2000x2000 or more pixels with 16 bit digitization. Peak quantum efficiency of 95% or better, with QE above 50% over the range of 400-700 nm and thermoelectric cooling to -70C or better, with lifetime guaranteed vacuum sealed chamber. Readout speed of 1 MHz or better, with 12 e- readout noise or better and dark current of 2e-3 e-/pix/sec or less. Detector shall be capable of on-chip binning to 256x256 super-pixels.<br /><br />&bull; Overall sensitivity of 10 Rayleigh or better<br /><br />&bull; Telecentric optics providing an effective f/# at the detector of 1.0 or less and narrow-band (2nm or less) filtering on the front end, matched efficiently to 4" filters on front end<br /><br />&bull; Telecentric front end optics compatible with 4" diameter narrow-band filters with 2 nm bandwidth and efficiently matched to detector optics <br /><br />&bull; Swappable front end optics providing the following fields of view: 15, 30, 60, and 90 degrees <br /><br />&bull; Automated computer-controlled temperature-stabilized filter wheel capable of holding 8 4"-diameter filters<br /><br />&bull; Automated integrated imager and filter wheel control software allowing pre-programmed automated operation and remote network access<br /><br />&bull; 2-nm passband 4" filters appropriate for observing emissions at the following wavelengths: 427.8, 557.7, 630.0, and 777.4 nm<br /><br />&bull; Automated high-reliability shutter with automatic light protection sensor<br /><br />&bull; High-speed USB interface<br /><br />&bull; Turn-key completely integrated system (front end optics, shutter, filter wheel, telecentric stages, re-imaging optics, and detector all mechanically secured to stand-alone chassis) optimized for observations of faint upper atmospheric phenomena. System shall be fully portable, weigh no more than approximately 100 lbs (in any one configuration-total weight including all possible front end optics and filters may be somewhat higher. 200 lbs maximum), fit within a 36"x24"x24" volume, and be sturdy enough to withstand frequent shipping and operation under field conditions without requiring realignment, disassembly, or reassembly. "Field conditions" refers to operation at remote sites with minimal infrastructure or support from trained personnel, typically from inside portable shelter with some climate control (temperature range 50-85 F) and viewing the sky through a dome. The sun shines directly onto the instrument through the dome during the day, which explains the need for an automatic light blocking shutter. The system is typically bolted to a wall or mechanically suspended from the ceiling below the dome. The area around the dome is covered with a black cloth to avoid stray light from inside the shelter getting into the lens, but the main part of the system can be expected to be exposed to at least some light during operation. A heavy system designed for a laboratory or dark room with parts of the optical train open to the room or needing an optical bench for support or alignment is not realistic. The system will operate at a single location anywhere from 2 weeks to multiple years, and generally the equipment is allowed to equilibrate to ambient conditions for 6 hours or more after opening the shipping boxes before actually operating it. No sudden temperature swings.<br /><br />&bull; System shall have mechanical mounting bracket sufficient to support weight of system in vertical or horizontal configuration. System shall be reliable enough to operate 24 hours per day for months at a time without requiring operator attention, and to be able to withstand daily operation (average 10 hours/day) for multiple years before failing or requiring replacement of mechanical components.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>Ques 2. Interior wall spec calls for dry wall to be mud, taped, and painted.

<DESC><p>Submission of white papers/proposals under subject BAA is temporarily suspended (SEE AMENDMENT 01). Due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, FY13 funding for this effort is no longer anticipated. Out-year funding remains unknown. Offerors should not submit any responses to this BAA until which time an amendment has been issued to re-open the BAA for white paper/proposal submission. NO WHITE PAPERS/PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p><br />The objective of this Open BAA is to encourage a flow of supplementary and/or complementary technologies for electromagnetic metamaterials. Such technologies may include active electronic matching networks, frequency selective structures, and periodic structure with engineered dispersion, including photonic band-gap materials, acoustic metamaterials. Innovative advancements in using metamaterials and/or complementary technologies that leverage commercial economies of scale are highly desired. The areas of focus are Radio Frequency (RF), Optical, Acoustic and Bio-Related Metamaterials.</p>

PDSS generally consists of software maintenance to correct defects in existing software, changes to DOD/DA policies and regulations, and hardware upgrades, testing of the software to ensure performance meets the requirements of the changed processes and that processes that were not changed still function as before, and documentation is updated in accordance with the change.  This includes providing both functional and technical support both telephonically and at user sites; providing training for software and/or hardware changes and installation of systems at new locations when tasked.  The Standard Army Ammunition System - Modernization (SAAS-MOD) is a STAMIS which requires support.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to extend an interim bridge contract to provide the services of the current Logistics Support Services contract, for a period of performance beginning December 1-31 2012.  A competitive contract was awarded 1 August 2004 to World Technical Services, Inc., PO box 33069, Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  Two interim bridge contracts were awarded consecutively with periods of performance starting 1 April 2010 through 31 July 2010 and 1 August 2010 through 30 November 2010. Two extensions to the second interim contract were performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, W9124L-10-C-0004, which was awarded as a sole source on 1 August 2010 to World Technical Services Inc. and will expire 30 November 2012.  This extension will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The extension will be issued to the current contractor, Primus Solutions Inc. (formally known as World Technical Services), Inc., and P.O. box 33069 Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  The contract type is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract.  This extension to the current bridge contract will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Sill Installation pending resolution of a protest.  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this one-month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the extension will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 561210.   Written comments to this notice and detailed capabilities must be faxed to (580)442-3819, ATTN:  Angela Triplett.  Email any questions to Mission Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sill, at angela.m.triplett@us.army.mil.   <br>  <br>

<DESC>The 773 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Medical Commodity Council, WPAFB, OH, awarded a modification under task order W91QUZ-06-D-0010 X001 with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) of Fairfax, VA. This modification is for transition and sustainment training services of the AHLTA system. A six month extension is required to guarantee there is no break in service for the subject work/task order. Otherwise, the delay in execution would result in serious financial harm to the Government and care of the AF healthcare beneficiaries. An extension modification is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 230(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. This notice is being posted because this option, under FAR52-217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award. The option exercise will be within rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for a period not to exceed six (6) months beginning on 24 Oct 2013. This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only company that has the infrastructure and corporate knowledge to meet the Governments need for AHLTA transition and training services in a state side and overseas environment without incurring a gap in service if the option were not exercise before the current contract expiration on 23 Oct 2012.<br />This notice is not a request for proposals. No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses should be made in writing by email or U.S. mail to the attention of Capt Joshua Nabors, <a href="mailto:Joshua.nabors@wpafb.af.mil">Joshua.nabors@wpafb.af.mil</a>, using the contact information provided in this synopsis. <br />

<p>The General Services Administration currently houses the Veterans Benefits Administration call center in Federal space in Auburn Washington. Currently they are housed in approximately 82,500 usable square feet (usf) (appx 95,000 rentable square feet) of office space at the Auburn Federal Complex, Auburn Washington under an Occupancy Agreement for the Veterans Benefits Administration, (VBA). The VBA currently works 7 days a week, 12 hour days to complete their mission. They are the only location in the country separating service members, defining their benefits, and mission requirements can only be met by being open daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building VBA is housed in, a converted 1940's warehouse, was severely damaged by an ice storm in early 2012. Studies were completed in September, 2012 which showed it would be extremely expensive, not cost effective to repair the building, and a snow event would put the building in jeopardy. Four inches of snow would close the building for a minimum of 48 hours. There is no cost effective solution that would allow the VBA to remain in federal space. Federal Center South will not be vacated until early December by the Corp of Engineers. It is currently substandard space, not seismically compliant and the VBA has determined it would not meet the time requirement and delays would put their mission at risk. The only viable solution is to put an emergency lease in place to enable the VBA to move prior to a potential snow event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several days of market research, the competition is being limited to the two locations that can meet all the requirements, including the limited time frame for move in and the contiguous space requirements. The following are the two locations that can meet all the requirements and are within the competitive range.</p>

<p>The engineering study determined the existing building to be unsafe in the event of a average snowfall of a few inches. GSA won't allow an agency to work in an unsafe building and will close the building for a minimum of 48 hours in the event of a 4 inch snowfall. The Veterans Benefit Administration cannot complete their mission if they don't have a fully functioning location for their employees, and VBA cannot be shut down for two plus days as this office services the whole country. Historically, the region receives approximately 1 inch of snow in November and 3 inches in December; however, there have been 6+ inch snowfalls in late November and 12+ inches or more in December documented over the last several years. With the need to avoid a mission shutdown, there is an urgent need to move the VA call center into a new location quickly.</p>

<p>No advertising is required when using urgent and compelling under <span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">FAR 6.302-2. Market information was found using COSTAR, Loopnet and Officespace.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In early October, 2012, GSA conducted a market survey and identified six potentially acceptable locations that might meet the agency's needs within the delineated area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the large delineated area, it was still difficult to find many competing properties with 82,500 usf in one building. When the properties were viewed, it was apparent that 2 could not meet the time frames, as permitting would not allow the major renovations in the time needed. One building, near Weyerheauser in Federal Way, had little transit and no amenities, and could not fit the requirement into one building. Three potential locations could potentially meet the requirement. Two potential locations were in the south end of the delineated area and are asking approximately $20 full service rents, while the other location was in Seattle and is asking approximately $28.50 full service rent, which would put the property outside the competitive range. (full service rents do not include tenant improvement allowances, approximately $6 per ft per year) See paragraph 7 for further details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two locations GSA will solicit for lease proposals are the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Centerpoint</p>
<p>20819 72<sup>nd</sup> Ave South</p>
<p>Kent, WA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SeaTac Towers. North</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; TEXT-INDENT: 0in; MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; tab-stops: .5in">Recent market surveys conducted by GSA showed the rental rate within the delineated area ranges from $13.00 and $15.00 NNN, for a full service rate of $18.00 to $22.00.With tenant improvements of approximately $6 per foot for 5 years, the expected full service rate with limited tenant improvement will be $23.00 to $28.00. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>These rates are similar to existing rates within the market that are under GSA leases. FAA in Renton currently pays $24.50 rsf full service rate with no tenant improvements. DHS in Tukwila currently pays a full service rate including tenant improvements of $39.37, which equates to approximately $31.50 full service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 9-10, GSA pulled a COSTAR report for the delineated area. The available office locations that might meet the needs were determined to be a total of 6 buildings within the delineated area. When reviewed, 5 buildings could potentially meet the requirement. It was determined after viewing the properties with our GSA subject matter experts, 2 of the buildings could not meet the timeline of a late November 2012 move in date due to the large buildout required. The other 3 locations could meet the requirement with carpet and paint, allowing for additional tenant improvements once the space is occupied.</p>
