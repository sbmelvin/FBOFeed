<DESC>Modernized Commodity Fuze<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. This is a Request for Information (RFI) from any interested party eligible to contract with the US Department of Defense concerning a potential modernization effort for the FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF). Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to refine the modernization acquisition plan, but may also be used to perform studies and analyses on existing and future fuzed weapons capable of being deployed from current and future fighters and bombers to perform required missions against a variety of soft and hardened targets. The RFI is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not construed as a commitment by the government. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br /><br />2. Foreign Participation: Any contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy, and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer. If the interested party is a foreign concern or if a U.S. interested party has a team member or partner who is a foreign entity, adherence to all International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) is required. The U.S. Government will provide foreign disclosure guidance to U.S. firms upon request.</p>
<p>3. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Direct Attack Division, Fuze Branch (AFLCMC/EBDZ), Eglin Air Force Base is planning to modernize the FMU-152A/B design to support affordable and reliable long-term production sustained by a robust supplier base. Preliminary planning includes a potential FY13 RFP release, FY14 Full and Open Competitive Source Selection, and FY15 contract award with start of production NLT FY18. Acceleration of contract award into FY14 may occur if funding is available. At this time the effort is being planned as an Air Force activity; however, the possibility of a joint Air Force and Navy modernization effort is being considered.</p>
<p>4. The FMU-152A/B was designed as a multi-delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible system for use with General Purpose blast/fragmentation and hardened target penetrator warheads, with cockpit selectable in-flight (prior to release) capability when used with MIL-STD-1760 compliant weapons. The current fuze is an electro-mechanical fuze; however, the Government is open to any technologies that may be available and viable to meet program requirements. Many of the technologies used in the current FMU-152 Electro-Mechanical Safe and Arm Design (EMSAD) are anticipated to face future challenges in obsolescence, manufacturability and component supplier base. The focus of this effort is to modernize the fuze design to support improved long-term manufacturability; it is not a requirements or capability improvement-driven effort.</p>
<p>5. Following are the key performance requirements under consideration for the modernized fuze. Current FMU-152A/B System Performance Specification (SPS) requirements and capabilities will generally be maintained, with some modification possible to accommodate changes in weapon system Concept of Operations and technologies as noted below. Potential differences with the current SPS are noted in italics. <br />a. Form and fit compatible with inventory warheads to include MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-111, BLU-113, BLU-117, BLU-121, BLU-122, BLU-126 and BLU-129.<br />b. Compatibility (physical, electrical, and logical) with guidance assemblies of the JDAM family (GBU-31, 32, 38, &amp; 54) and the Paveway family (GBU-10, 12, 24, 27, &amp; 28) of guidance kits.<br />c. Fuze will be powered by a bomb fuze initiator and meet the requirements of MIL-STD-1316F. A FZU will be provided by the contractor with each fuze as part of the contract. Design information on the current initiator (FZU-63/B) can be made available; however, it will be the contractor's responsibility to deliver an initiator qualified to meet the power requirements of the new fuze. <em>If the decision for a joint program is made, the fuze system performance specification may be adjusted to accommodate Navy unique initiator requirements (i.e., Fuze Function Control Set compatibility). <br /></em>d. Fuze will be capable of being carried by and launched from the following aircraft platforms: A-10C, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22A, F-35A, B-1B, B-2A, B-52H and MQ-9. <em>If the decision for a joint program is made, the system performance specification will be adjusted to accommodate AV-8B, F-18C/D/E/F, and F-35 B/C.<br /></em>e. Fuze will provide airburst capability through integration with the DSU-33 proximity sensor and provide selective control to inhibit the airburst function. <br />f. The current fuze is designed for 100 hours external and 200 hours internal captive carriage life. <em>The Government is interested in increasing captive carriage life to as much as 900 hours external and/or internal. Final SPS captive carriage requirements may be influenced by industry inputs as requested below. <br /></em>g. Fuze captive carriage and launch environment (altitude and airspeed) will be compatible with the JDAM and Paveway-series weapon systems on identified aircraft platforms (listed in 5d above).<br />h. Fuze will be capable of detonating with non-hardened target impact angles and velocities of the GBU-31(MK-84, BLU-117), GBU-32(MK-83, BLU-110), GBU-38/54 (MK-82, BLU-111, BLU-126, BLU-129), and GBU-10/12/16/24/27(with associated GP warhead). <br />i. Hardened target capability will be <em>10,000 psi reinforced concrete (threshold) (objective = 15,000 psi reinforced concrete).</em> The range of hardened target impact angles and velocities is the terminal operating velocity of the GBU-28 and GBU-31 (BLU-109) weapons.<br /><em>j. The Government is interested in increasing fuze survivability from a single target layer to multiple layers. This is a survivability capability and not a layer/void counting capability. Final SPS survivability requirements may be influenced by industry inputs as requested below.<br /></em>k. Fuze will be capable of being programmed through the aircraft cockpit, as well as through manual settings on the fuze face. This will be a Key Performance Parameter.<br />l. Fuze will have function time delays from instantaneous, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 90, 180, 240 ms; 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes; 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours. <br />m. Fuze will allow for setting arm times from 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 14, 21, 25 seconds for low drag and 2, 2.6, 3, 3.5, 4, 5 seconds with lockout for high drag. <br />n. Fuze will be capable of initiating all current insensitive munitions (IM) explosives and be IM compliant. <em>This may include a change from current PBXN-7 booster if there is one better suited for current IM explosive detonation sensitivity.<br /></em>o. Fuze will be designed to meet the USAF safety requirements and standards <em>(and Navy standards if joint program is pursued).<br /></em>p. Operational service life will be 10 years minimum, with a combined storage and service life of 20 years minimum.<br />q. Fuze system (RFMU*RFZU*Rcomponents=Rfuze system) will provide a threshold reliability of 0.95, minimum, with an objective of 0.98, when employed following operational service life. <br />r. Fuze system production rates should be able to range from 200/month to 2000+/month, with a broad Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) band to support average unit production cost stability given fluctuations in funding.</p>
<p>6. RFI responses will be used by the Government to refine the project's estimated cost, schedule and technical risk assessment to support a high confidence program plan and strategy. RFI responses are requested to include the following:<br />a. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule to complete necessary design, development, qualification and test activities and reach production readiness.<br />b. Expected Critical Technologies and state of technology (i.e., Technology and Manufacturing Readiness Levels) at contract award. Provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts that support your technology and manufacturing assessments.<br />c. Discuss whether an Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD), EMSAD or other design might be proposed. <br />d. Specifically address how the following requirements under consideration are cost, schedule, technology, and/or manufacturing drivers and provide recommendations to reduce program impact. Note any additional drivers not listed below. <br />i. Navy Fuze Function Control Set<br />ii. Increased captive carriage hours<br />iii. Increasing hard target strength from 5,000 psi to 10,000 psi reinforced concrete<br />iv. Increasing fuze survivability from single layer to multi-layer targets<br />v. Long function time delays up to 24 hours<br />e. Whether there are other system requirements or program planning aspects not stated above that significantly impact cost, schedule or technical risk of successfully achieving an affordable and reliable production design.<br />f. ROM estimate of the quantity range for the most efficient EOQ bands and associated production unit cost for the delivered fuze system (fuze, FZU, closure ring, cable, container). If the Modernized Commodity Fuze effort is not funded, provide inputs on the industrial base capability to continue to supply mechanical and electro-explosive components over the long-term.<br />g. ROM for technical data package and/or license rights suitable for any potential follow-on production competition.</p>
<p>7. If requested, a Technical Data Package (TDP) containing the current Interface Control Documents and SPS for the FMU-152A/B and accessories will be made available to qualified respondents for reference only. Respondents must officially request the documents in writing. To validate the documentation release, this request must include the company name, mailing address, email address, point of contact, phone number, current CAGE number and Central Contractor Registration number. The written request must include acknowledgement of the Responder's responsibility under the U.S. export contract laws and regulations. For any foreign firm, the request must include proof of a current and applicable approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act if applicable. Upon verification of status and acknowledgement of responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations, approved authorization confirmation to receive the requested documents will be provided.</p>
<p>8. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. AFLCMC/EBDZ uses manpower technical support contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements to include review of these capabilities submittals. These contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires the service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented.</p>

<DESC>Public Announcement of Intent to Purchase on a Sole Source Basis. The Government intends to procure the performance of safety upgrades to 2 Elevating Transfer Vehicles (ETVs) to Lodige. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This synopsis is being published for informational purposes only. The proposed source is Lodige. The proposed action is to perform safety upgrades to 2 ETVs at Charleston AFB, South Carolina. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination was made not to compete this proposed procurement since market research findings resulted in original equipment manufacturers being unable to provide the level of safety certification required by the Air Force&nbsp;on another manfacturer's ETV.&nbsp; The Air Force requires certification that the entire ETV is safe if a lift cable breaks.

<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has an existing requirement for Verification and Validation of Flight Critical System tools and methodologies. NASA/ARC proposes to negotiate a sole source contract with Drexel University for a period of nine (9) months commencing on or about February 15, 2013 through November 15, 2013 to continue performance of a previously awarded contract (NNA10DE79C) to the University of Virginia. NASA/ARC intends to continue the work begun at the University of Virginia with Drexel University. The reason for this change is because the projects Principal Investigator (PI), Ellen Bass, is relocating to Drexel University. The University of Virginia contract was original selected because of the PIs experience and expertise. This work is critical to NASA and to date has fully satisfied NASAs requirements. Therefore, it is not in the governments best interest to award to another institution other than Drexel University where the PI will continue her work. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 14, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Note: NNA13463702Q was originally posted on January 17, 2013 with a due date of January 24, 2013. However, this notice was incorrectly posted as a solicitation/synopsis instead of a synopsis. Since the original due date for the solicitation/synopsis is in the past, and the EPS system will not allow posting in arrears, this synopsis will post on January 31, 2013 and remain open for 15 calendar days, through February 14, 2013. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

QUESTION: Reference - The posting for RFP W15QKN-12-R-E013 indicates that the contract will be for the acquisition of Commercial Services with incidental supplies  The PWS for T0 0001 indicates that satisfactory completion cannot be achieved without designing, testing and delivering an RF Subsystem that meets a detailed set of requirements.  Is the RF Subsystem an incidental supply item or is T0 0001 a fixed price supply task order for a commercial item?
RESPONSE: The contract allows for the delivery of material and hardware. This item is considered hardware.
QUESTION: Is there any Proprietary Data associated with the NGATS RF Microwave Frequency Support?
RESPONSE: There is no proprietary data associated with this task.
QUESTION: Para 4.3.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall support all current and future requirements
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall support all current and known future requirements
RESPONSE:  We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies.
QUESTION: Para 4.3.1.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall assure all current and future systems are addressed.
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall assure all current and known future systems are addressed.
RESPONSE: We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies.
QUESTION: Para 4.23.1 of the TASK01 PWS states All data delivered to the Government shall be unlimited. All markings contrary to this and existing in the TDP shall be removed before delivery.
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: The Government shall have unlimited rights to data that is developed under this contract.
RESPONSE:   Noted. The wording is not changed.
QUESTION:
BASIC PWS Para 4.3.2 states The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible.
Recommend above wording be changed as follows: The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software to the greatest extent possible, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible.
RESPONSE:   Proprietary information is not to be submitted. The wording will not be changed.
QUESTION:
TASK 01 PWS Paragraph 4.20.1 states One complete set of technical data suitable for recomplete for the all prototype hardware shall be delivered. The design of the hardware product baseline shall be documented through the use of engineering data. The TDP shall conform to data item description, DI-SESS-8100D (CDRL A008), Product Drawings/Models and Associated Lists.
Recommend that the recomplete level TDP be defined on a task-by-task basis to ensure prototype efforts are timely and affordable.
RESPONSE:   Noted, will be defined with what level of data is required.
QUESTION: There appears to be a discrepancy between the Labor Category and Rates Table in Section L and the Labor Category Descriptions file. The table lists labor category G Software Engineer, while there is no labor category description.
RESPONSE:  The Labor Category Description file will be revised.
QUESTION:
FIRST TASK ORDER
Will we have access to an NGATS system software, in order to integrate the new hardware?
RESPONSE: Yes the software will be made available if required.
QUESTION: This should be covered by a general statement that it needs re-work.
RESPONSE:  The comment is unclear. Unable to provide a response.
QUESTION: For paragraph 4.14.1 (PWSFirstTask.doc):   Requires the contractor to supply an integration log book (CDRL A007) for the RF sub-system [at paragraph 4.14.2].  However, the description for CDRL A007 is for a TPS Integration Log book.  What is the Governments expectation for the content, format, etc of an RF Subsystem integration log book?
RESPONSE:  This is an error and will be corrected. The log book will be in contractor format and specified in the CDRL.
QUESTION: In Section 5.3.1 one of the future ATE Systems listed is ARGCS.  What is the role that ARGCS will play in the US Army Standard Family of Testers?
RESPONSE: The ARGCS was an evaluation/demonstration project. It will not be part of the IFTE family of Testers.
QUESTION: From the time of the Sources Sought, until now at Draft RFP, the EO/IR Hardware Requirements and the IRWindows Software requirements have been dropped.  Is it to be assumed there will be no EO/IR type activities implemented on this IDIQ?
RESPONSE:  The EO requirement has been put back into the basic PWS.
QUESTION: FIRST TASK ORDER
What type of Acceptance test will be required, for the first task? e.g.Will there be TPS's that need to be integrated with the RF subsystem.
RESPONSE: No. Functional testing to verify the subsystem meets the requirements. 10/03/12 IPT: Joe Cuccaro to review and provide a response. The first task will most likely be de-scoped to eliminate the prototype delivery.
QUESTION: It appears that an update is required for the data in the tables of paragraph 4.3.  For instance, frequency measurement inputs normally specify sensitivity (lowest measurable signal) as well as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).  Can we expect this appendix to be revised?
RESPONSE: All errors will be corrected in the final version
QUESTION: Why is a commitment letter for the basic PWS required, when no work will be awarded on the base?
RESPONSE: In conjunction with the resumes, letters of commitment from each person identified shall be provided documenting the Offeror's availability to begin performing this effort at the time of award. This is in accordance with Instructions to Offerors - Sections L and Evaluation Factors for Award - M Subfactor 2 (Personnel Knowledge and Experience).  The Government wants to ensure that the offeror has personnel available to support this effort as stated in the Performance Work Statement.

<DESC>EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based upon the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel). These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support. The complete scopes of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed herein. The EXPRESS program consists of four (4) domains in which services may be ordered: Technical, Programmatic, Logistics, and Business and Analytical (B&A). Competitively awarded BPAs have been established in each of the domains as follows: Business & Analytical - 4 each, Logistics - 6 each, Programmatic - 6 each, and Technical - 11 each. The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the Government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Leaders the opportunity to restructure existing teams. The purpose of the current open season is to add additional BPA teams.  <br>  <br> The Government intends to award additional BPAs in the following domains as noted: B&A - two small business (SB); Logistics - one full and open (F&O) and two SB; Programmatic - one F&O, 2 SB and one 8A; and Technical - one F&O, one SB and one 8A. These are estimated numbers only. The Government reserves the right to vary the number of awards depending on the number of responsive quotations submitted. The F&O awards will be determined first, followed by the SB awards, and finally the 8(a) awards. Eligibility to compete for the anticipated BPA awards is limited to those businesses which hold one of the required GSA schedules and, for the SB/8A awards, which meet the size standards for the NAICS Code applicable to that schedule identified as primary for the EXPRESS program. Respondents may seek consideration as a prime/team leader in more than one domain.  <br>  <br> Each prime/team leader is required to hold at least one of the following GSA schedules at the time it responds to the Request for Quotation (RFQ): 871-Professional Engineering Services (PES), 874V-Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), 874-Management Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), 70-Information Technology (IT), or a 00CORP-Consolidated Products and Services Schedule (formerly Corporate Schedule) including appropriate PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS, or IT Special Item Numbers. Respondents may submit multiple schedules per domain in response to the RFQ. However, a primary schedule that will be used by the prime/team leader to satisfy the majority of the domain requirements must be identified. Companies interested in obtaining a GSA schedule, or expediting a schedule application that has been submitted may contact the local representative, Eddie Mills via email at eddie.mills@gsa.gov.  <br>  <br> If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondents' schedule by GSA will apply. If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541330 and a size standard of $35.5M, will apply to the Business & Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS Code 541712 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain. If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS Code 541511/541512/541513 and a size standard of $25.5M will apply to all domains. If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary special item number covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the majority of domain requirements must also be identified. The NAICS Code and size standard for the primary special item number, as identified above, will then apply. The applicable NAICS Code must be available on the schedule identified as primary. The small business certification which was made at the primary schedule contract level, for that applicable NAICS Code, will be utilized to determine business size for EXPRESS.  <br>  <br> The Open Season Requests for Quotation (RFQs) are anticipated to be posted to the EXPRESS Public Website on Monday, 4 February, 2013, at the following link: <br>  <br> http://www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc-rsa/Express.asp <br>  <br> Responses to the RFQs will be due approximately 30 days after the RFQ issue date.  All documentation required for response to the RFQs will be available on the website above. The RFQs will contain specific instructions for submittal of quotations.  <br>  <br> RFQ Numbers are as follows: W31P4Q-13-T-0048 (B&A), W31P4Q-13-T-0049 (LOG), W31P4Q-13-T-0050 (PROG), and W31P4Q-13-T-0051 (TECH). <br>  <br> Respondents are cautioned that failure to comply with the following criteria will result in the rejection of their submission, and they will not be considered for award: (1) Must hold one of the required GSA schedules, as of the date of submission of quote, and (2) Submission of all required documentation as stated in the RFQ.  <br>  <br> Responses to the RFQs shall be enclosed in a sealed package and delivered to the following location no later than the date specified in Block 8 of the RFQ SF 1449.  In addition those Offerors who choose to deliver RFQ packages in person and who do not have current post access privileges, should contact the below POC not later than 10 business days before the due date of the RFQ for post access information.  <br>  <br>    Army Contracting Command - Redstone (ACC-RSA) <br>    Attn: CCAM-EX-P / Mr. Elbert Clarke <br>    Sparkman Center, Building 5303 <br>    Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898 <br>    (256) 876-2649 / elbert.clarke@us.army.mil <br>  <br> Respondents are advised that responses sent by conventional US Mail service or courier services (Federal Express and UPS) are not routed directly to the above address.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Phenomenex, Inc., 411 Madrid Ave., Torrance, California, 90501-1430.
<p>The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The NAICS code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The requirement for this award is to acquire 90 solid phase extraction plates for analysis of samples for ricin, tetramine, and aldicarb. The extraction plates are polymeric reversed phase 96-well plate 60mg/well.</p>
<p>Phenomenex is the only source available to provide these extraction plates. These plates are utilized as part of an ongoing testing and analysis program. The program requires that all analysis methods be validated in order to ensure accurate results. Multiple analysis methods using the extraction plates produced by Phenomenex have already undergone a stringent validation process based on CLIA regulations for method verification and validation. Changing to a different extraction plate during the course of this program would require a new validation process for three of the analysis methods currently in use, which would cause unreasonable delay and expense to the government. Therefore Phenomenex is the only source available.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Phenomenex. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to David Serwitz VIA EMAIL ONLY at WVY5@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-Q-15404 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN February 15, 2013. The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal requests. All requests must be in writing.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services in the future.</p>

In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a pre-solicitation / notice of intent synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive (including brand-name) award to Life Technologies for TF, BDT v3.1 RR-5000 &amp; SEQ BUFFER.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the Hematology Laboratory intends to negotiate and award a purchase on a sole source noncompetitive basis for TF, BDT v3.1 RR-5000 &amp; SEQ BUFFER to Life Technologies, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City CA 94404.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Hematology Branch laboratory conducts research on the genetic basis of bone marrow failure diseases, viruses, acute leukemias, and hepatic cirrhosis. Some of the basic approach to these studies is the performance of genetic sequencing, for example, the multiple genes involved in telomere erosion and repair in blood samples of thousands of patients with acquired aplastic anemia and other syndromes per year or obtaining sequences of new viruses. The genetic analyzers have specific reagents/consumables associated with it.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The contractor shall supply all labor, materials, facilities, equipment, and supplies to perform or supply the following:</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />The objective of this procurement is to provide reagents/consumables for genetic analysis.</p>
<p>The HBL genetic analysis projects require reagents specific to the genetic analyzing machine. The TF, BDT v3.1 RR-5000 &amp; SEQ BUFFER is the Big Dye Terminator (BDT) and the companion sequencing buffer which is specifically manufactured for use with our Applied Biosystems (ABI) Genetic Analyzer model 3130xL.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain the BDT which are reagents used in a reaction to decipher the sequence of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (or simply DNA). DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases-adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine-in a strand of DNA.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />A. Contractor Requirements<br />1. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor will delivered the reagents/consumables in accordance with the contract <br />2. Shipped the reagents/consumables in proper temperature conditions<br />3. The shipment of reagents/consumables must arrived at the times agreed upon<br />4. Contractor is responsible for ensuring the correct reagents/consumables and quantities are delivered<br />Government Responsibilities:<br />The government will receive the reagents/consumables and ensure they are error free; if a problem does exist the Government shall notify the contractor immediately that they intend to reject the reagents/consumables and arrange for a replacement of the shipment.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:<br />After receipt, inspection and acceptance of the reagents/consumables, the contractor is required to invoice the Government. The inspection will take place in the Hematology Branch Laboratory Building 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892<br />JUSTIFICATION<br />The sole-single justification for other than full and open competition is: <br /><br />&bull; This reagent is specifically manufactured for use with the Government Applied Biosystems (ABI) Genetic Analyzer model 3130xL. To continue the DNA sequencing consistent and carry out the accurate research BDT must be used. Without this reagent it would render the instruments and prior research useless.<br />&bull; Investigators in the Hematology Branch study the clinical features and laboratory path physiology of a wide variety of bone marrow failure states, hematological malignancies, and single or multi-lineage cytopenias. There are many active IRB-approved Hematology Branch research protocols for these types of subjects where requests are made for CLIA regulated diagnostic genetic analysis.<br />&bull; An example of our protocols/projects requiring genetic analysis is for patients who participate in Clinical Protocol # 97-H-0041 or Project #94-H-0010. In these studies, some patients with aplastic anemia (AA) or severe aplastic anemia (SAA) are screened for Telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene mutations and these gene mutations are revealed by genetic analysis using the ABI 3130xL and BDT. TERC is an RNA gene found in eukaryotes, which is a component of telomerase used to extend telomeres. This procedure using BDT, the associated reagents and instruments/accessories manufactured by ABI is a diagnostic test regulated by The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) who regulates all laboratories testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (OCSQ) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program. Diagnostic under CLIA regulation cannot be modified without approval.<br />&bull; Based on the Sources Sought posted on 1/25/2013 under the following number HS-NIH-NHLBI-CSB-(SBSS)-2013-076-DDC, there were no small businesses that responded to this notice therefore, there are no small businesses capable of providing the requested product.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. <br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 325199 and the Size Standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation / notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis for TF, BDT v3.1 RR-5000 &amp; SEQ BUFFER to Life Technologies, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94494 is based upon the responses to the sources sought synopsis published in the FedBizOpps on January 25th 2013, HHS-NIH-NHLBI-CSB-(SBSS)-2013-076-DDC, Title: Reagents for Genetic Analysis (i.e. Sequencing) using the ABI313xL.

<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition with one award reserved for a small business. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to one responsible small business Offeror and the remaining responsible Offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.

This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.
  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, repair, and renovation by design-build or design-bid-build, of airfield paving and heavy duty paving projects at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility (AOR) including, but not limited to, California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237310, and the annual size standard is $33.5 million.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $99,000,000.  Task orders will range between $500,000 and $20,000,000.  Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.
  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two:  Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Small Business Utilization, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).
  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  No site visit will be held, and no formal pre-proposal conference will be conducted. THE SOLICITATION AND PRE-PROPOSAL PRESENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about February 19, 2013.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<p>&bull;	Building name and address and location of the available space within the building;<br />&bull;	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced;<br />&bull;	ANSI/BOMA office area-(ABOA) square feet to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced. Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, (if any);<br />&bull;	Date of space availability; <br />&bull;	Building ownership information;<br />&bull;	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking, (if any);<br />&bull;	Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; <br />&bull;	List of building services provided</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC><p>By way of this Notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 5.101(a)(1), The Chicago District U. S. Army Corps of Engineers announces its intentions to award a Sole Source, Firm Fixed-Price Contract to Smith-Root Incorporated (SRI), 14014 NE Salmon Creek Avenue, Vancouver, Washington, 98686 to provide a means for synchronizing the operation of the pulsers at the Aquatic Nuisance Species Dispersal Barriers Project Site (Fish Barriers), located in Romeoville, Illinois.</p>
<p>SRI has the specific expertise to perform the work, as it is the only producer of the firmware and pulser control boards that control the firing of the pulsers. Changes to synchronize the firing sequence require modifications to the boards and the firmware. SRI is the only company with intimate knowledge and access to the firmware and circuitry used in the fabrication of the Pulser Controller Boards of the Fish Barriers. SRI has been identified as the only entity with the appropriate level of expertise, resources, and advance technologies in the supply and installation of the fish barrier components required to complete the work. In fact, this work is a follow-on contract for supply and installation of Fish Barrier components awarded through Contract No. DACW23-03-C-0013 and W912P6-11-C-0007.</p>
<p>If award were to be made to other than SRI, the Government would endure substantial duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>The Classification Code for this procurement is North American Industry System (NAICS) 811310 - "Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment (except Automotive and Electronic) Repair and Maintenance", with a Small Business Standard size of $7,000,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice is NOT a Request for Proposal therefore NO solicitation documents will be issued. Contractors who feel they can provide these services may submit a detailed qualification statement addressing the required services. Qualification statements must be submitted on or before 15 February 2013, NO LATER THAN 4:30PM CDST to anita.r.simpkins@usace.army.mil, (ensure that the number of the Pre-Solicitation Notice of "W912P6-13-R-0009" is included in the subject line of the email) or by fax addressed to Anita R. Simpkins at (312) 886-5475. All submitted qualification statements will be considered.</p>

The MACC program consists of soliciting and awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include full project design from a concept or performance-oriented statement of work through construction completion. Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 - Subsector 236 - Construction of Buildings - Size Standard $33.5 million; Subsector 237 - Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- size standard $33.5 million; and Subsector 238 - Special Trade Contractors - Size Standard $14 million. Successful MACC program contractors are given fair opportunity to compete for projects described in individual task order solicitations and will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, and new construction integrating multiple construction trades/disciplines. Project task orders will range between $300,000 - $5,000,000. The anticipated performance period will run from 6 Aug 2013 to 5 Aug 2014 plus 4 1-year option periods. </span></p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.002(b)(2)(i) this notice is issued for the purpose of market research to determine what types of businesses are capable and experienced to perform the required work. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THE RFP RESULTING FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE WILL BE ISSUED SEPARATELY AND ADVERTISED on the GSA Advantage eBuy Website https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do. The information received will be used to determine whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside or full and open competition (unrestricted). The extent of the work is described within the attached statement of work.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is seeking a qualified contractor that can administer the Employment and Training Administration's (ETA) National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), a national random survey of the employment, demographic, and health characteristics of hired crop farm workers. When submitting your response, please provide a list and description of survey research activities to demonstrate how the firm meets the criteria.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has collected information on the demographic and employment characteristics of hired farm workers since the 1940s. Until 1987, the Hired Farm Workforce Survey, a December supplement to the Current Population Survey, was used to collect the information from agricultural employers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture summarized the information in hired farm worker profile reports. In 1988, and as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), the DOL assumed responsibility for collecting this information.<br />To comply with the IRCA mandate, which required annual estimates of the rate at which seasonal agricultural service workers exited the farm labor market, the DOL launched the NAWS, an establishment-based survey of hired crop farm workers. The NAWS questionnaire will be used to collect farm worker demographic, employment, and health information through in-person interviews with farm workers, over the contract period.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the NAWS has changed since the IRCA mandate and annual estimates of the rate at which farm workers leave agriculture are currently not required. As such, farm workers are interviewed only once per year and no attempts are made to locate the same respondent in ensuing interview periods. There are three data collection cycles each year. The start date for the fall, winter-spring, and summer cycle typically occurs between the first and fifteenth of October, February, and June, respectively. Each cycle lasts approximately three months. As such, interviews are conducted on a nearly year-round basis.</p>
<p>Federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as private organizations utilize NAWS findings for a multitude of purposes, such as quantifying and assessing the human resources that are available to agriculture. The findings are also utilized in programs that aim to improve the well being of farm workers and their dependents. At the Federal level, these programs have included the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP), Migrant and Seasonal Head Start, Migrant Education, and Migrant Health.<br />Since 1988, the DOL has collaborated with several Federal agencies to increase the utility of the NAWS, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Administration for Children and Families, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Collaboration with Federal agencies will continue over the contract period.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for carrying out the NAWS and delivering a variety of NAWS-based research products on topics relevant to the ETA and other Federal agencies that administer migrant and seasonal farm worker and related programs. Activities undertaken in this project include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; using Unemployment Insurance data and other information sources to develop a sampling frame of agricultural employers<br />&bull; using farm labor and agricultural production data from various sources to implement a multi-stratified probability-based sampling methodology,<br />&bull; developing and testing survey questions,<br />&bull; training interviewers to randomly select and interview between 1,500 and 3,000 farm workers per year,<br />&bull; developing and managing information for the construction of sampling and post-sampling weights, <br />&bull; managing, safeguarding, and analyzing data for the development and dissemination of research products, such as public-use and restricted-use datasets, reports, and on-line data tables, and <br />&bull; conducting appropriate statistical analysis and summarizing data in written, tabular, and graphic formats to complete deliverables</p>
<p>The performance of the contract will involve access to confidential data, including data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

As such, offerors who may be contemplating contracting portions of the work requirement that involve handling of sampling frame data, such as data collection, are hereby advised that further contracting for such purposes will not be permitted.

<CONTACT>Brian Souter, Phone 9195410401, Email brian.souter@nih.gov
<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of the notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>Background.The National Institution of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) was deeded the South Campus location on June 26, 1967, by the Research Triangle Foundation (RTF). The NIEHS has only a proprietary interest in this land. This in effect means that although the Federal Government (NIEHS) has acquired title to this area in North Carolina, it has not obtained any measure of the State's authority over the area. This finding mandates that all contractors operating on all NIEHS property, leased or owned, in Durham County must adhere to all state and local requirements (i.e. building permits, etc). The NIEHS is one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) principal Federal Agency for biomedical research on the health effects of environmental agents.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective.The NIEHS purpose and need for the proposed requirement is to award and IDIQ contract for (i) Chemical Waste Disposal; (ii) Radioactive Waste Disposal; and (iii) Mixed Waste Disposal.</p>
<p>Project Requirement.The NIEHS is seeking all capable and qualified organizations to fully provide comprehensive waste management services for the removal, transportation and disposal of chemical, radioactive and mixed wastes generated by the NIEHS, with dedicated vehicles, equipment, personnel, and management support. The NIEHS anticipates an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract award.</p>

<p><br />Other Important Consideration. The NAICS Code is 562211 with a size standard of $33.5M. An Operating Permit has been issued to the NIEHS under the North Carolina Hazardous Waste Management Rules (NCHWMR) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for the storage, treatment, and disposal of certain hazardous wastes. The permit describes specific conditions, duties, and requirements with which the contract holder must comply. Additionally, a Material License has been issued to the NIEHS under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-438), and Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, Parts 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40 and 70. The license authorizes the NIEHS to receive, acquire, possess, and transfer certain byproducts, source and/or special nuclear material, and to use such materials for research and development, laboratory tracer studies, gas chromatography and instrument calibration, and irradiation of biological samples except those of explosive or hazardous material/waste and waste radioactive material contract holder must comply with.</p>

<p>The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Special Programs Division, is seeking possible sources to provide design-build services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. <br /><br />The size standard associated with NAICS 236220 is $33.5 million (effective August 22, 2008), which means that a company, including its affiliates, would be considered a "small business" if their average annual gross receipts do not exceed $33.5 million for the past three years. If a company has not been in business for three years, the average weekly revenue for the number of weeks the company has been in business is multiplied by 52 to determine the average annual receipts.</p>

<DESC>Title: Census Bureau's Field Directorate Data Broker Support Services
<p><br />This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought notice for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Since this is a sources sought notice, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Census Bureau's Field Directorate is responsible for collecting data from survey or census respondents via telephone, personal visit, or by mail for current surveys and programs, special censuses, and decennial censuses. To improve the quality of our data, minimize field cost, and improve timeliness of our data collection activities, the Census Bureau's Field Directorate seek contractor support from a data broker that will provide our 6 Regional Offices (New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles) and 3 Telephone Centers (Hagerstown, MD, Tucson, AZ, Jeffersonville, IN) a single point access to a comprehensive database of information that will allow the Field Directorate to contact/locate specific respondents and/or addresses. Staff located in the regional offices and telephone centers will utilize the database to search missing information (such as last name, address, telephone number) for the field representatives to complete official Census Bureau surveys.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau's Field Directorate seeks qualified sources that provide a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product that provides access to a comprehensive database (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) of updated personal identifiable information. The COTS solution will be used for locating and/or contacting respondents in association with official Census Bureau surveys and censuses. This database must contain information that is updated monthly. The service provider will ensure that federal users are fully trained on applying matching logic to improve match rates and will provide technical assistance at all times via telephone.</p>
<p>Critical Functionality:</p>
<p>The COTS database must allow searches to be performed, via the internet, in the following manner:</p>
<p>1. Searches on minimal information such as last, name, telephone numbers, address, zip code at broad (state level) or specific (county/city) geographic level.</p>
<p>2. The use of "wildcard" to substitute one or more alphabet or numeric search characters.</p>
<p>3. Information on neighbors to a specific address that includes their name, telephone number, and tenure at their address.</p>
<p>4. Demographic information at an address that includes household membership with ages of occupants, tenure at address, and owner/rental status.</p>
<p>5. Phone + Premium (cell phone search).</p>
<p>6. Business information that includes name of building owner.</p>
<p>Training and Technical Support:</p>
<p>The COTS provider shall provide bi-annual training to new and existing users in person, by telephone, and/or by video conference on the product's features and functionality.</p>
<p>The COTS provider shall provide ongoing technical support to all Census offices and telephone centers by telephone or site visit during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00am through 5:00pm. The technical support will allow users to contact and communicate product issues.</p>
<p>Capability Statements:</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must provide a capability statement demonstrating their capability to fulfill the Government's requirement for a COTS product/license. All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities. The capability statement shall be in sufficient detail, but not exceed 8 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirement above. Your capability statement should include references. Responses must be received by 4:30 EST on February 12, 2013 via email to Donna Cornish, Contract Specialist at donna.cornish@census.gov.</p>

<a href="mailto:emily.h.jenkins@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>Description - The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> Construct a new elementary school, replacing and consolidating two old elementary schools.  The project will include general purpose classrooms, gymnasium, information center, computer lab, science labs, supply areas, specialist rooms, music room, art room, learning impaired room, teacher work rooms, counseling areas, storage and administrative offices.  Project includes related infrastructure such as parking areas, mechanical rooms, delivery areas, and playgrounds. The project includes site improvements: signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, covered walkways, exterior lighting and utilities.   <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law.  <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Louisville District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Emily.H.Jenkins@usace.army.mil no later than by 1:00 PM EST on 11 February 2013.  <br>  <br>

<DESC>Labor Market Survey: In addressing projects within the scope of Executive Order 13502, USACE districts will need to undertake a labor market survey as part of their PLA evaluation process. USACE district PDTs should consider the following:
<p>1. Issuing a Sources Sought Notice:<br />The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:</p>
<p>Dredging and Beachfill, Delaware River Main Channel Deepening, Pennsylvania, New Jersey &amp; Delaware</p>
<p>Project Description: Contract work will consist of new work dredging within the Delaware River and placement of beachfill material on Broadkill Beach, Delaware. The proposed work will also include:</p>
<p>&bull; Dredging work shall include dredging of the Miah Maull and Brandywine Ranges of the<br />Delaware River main channel from Station 438+200 to Station 512+000.<br />&bull; Dredging shall be required to a depth of 45 feet MLLW plus 1-foot allowable over depth within the contract work limits. <br />&bull; The side slope dredging requirements for this project are 3H to 1V within the dredging contract work limits. <br />&bull; The beachfill work shall include the placement of approximately 1,800,000 cubic yards of dredged material covering a total of approximately 15,000 linear feet of beach. <br />&bull; Satisfactory beachfill material will be pumped from the Delaware River main channel for nourishment of the existing beach and dune system.<br />&bull; Installation of new sand fence; the planting of dune grass; and the re-construction of pedestrian, vehicle and handicap dune crossovers.<br />&bull; Government-furnished borrow area available for use under this contract is the Delaware River main channel located approximately 10 miles off Broadkill Beach. All material for beachfill work shall be obtained from this approved location only.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project. <br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Beach Rehabilitation project at Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Beach Rehabilitation project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?</p>
<p>g. How will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals?</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email to Sandi Fletcher, Contract Specialist, at <br />Sandra.G.Fletcher@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on 07 February 2013.</p>

<DESC><strong>1 Synopsis</strong><br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Polar Icebreaker Replacement Project Office as a means of market research for (A) candidate heavy polar icebreaker designs and (B) United States (US) shipyards capable of building a heavy polar icebreaker. This RFI is issued as a precursor to a potential polar non-nuclear icebreaker procurement program and to initiate market research in assisting the USCG develop an acquisition strategy for new construction of a potential non-nuclear heavy icebreakers. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information.<br /><br /><strong>2 Purpose</strong><br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to assess industry's capability (A) to provide a candidate design for a heavy polar Icebreaker and (B) to build a heavy polar icebreaker. The USCG requests that members of industry respond to this RFI by describing their ability to fulfill one or both of these capabilities. <br /><br />The Congressional Research Service "Coast Guard Polar Icebreaker Modernization: Background and Issues for Congress" Report, dated December 10, 2012, provides additional background information on the Coast Guard's missions and current icebreaking capabilities.<br /><br /><strong>3 Polar Icebreaker Design</strong><br /><br />At a minimum, a candidate heavy icebreaker design must be able to perform the missions performed by the USCGC Polar Star. At a continuous speed of 3 kt, the Polar Star can break ice 6 ft (1.8 m) thick, and by ramming can break 21 ft (6.4 m) pack. Further information regarding the USCGC Polar Star can be accessed via: <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/cgcPolarStar/History.asp">http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/cgcPolarStar/History.asp</a>. <br /><br />Information on candidate designs submitted must be based on: <br />1) Proven, currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the US; <br />2) In-service vessel designs that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; <br />3) Variants of in-service vessel designs capable of being licensed in the US; or<br />4) For new designs or new construction, also include details regarding its current status and expected in-service date. <br /><br />Candidate designs responses will be accepted from both domestic and international entities, but the vessel must be able to be licensed to be built in the US. Please submit general information on a candidate design and a point of contact for design-specific follow-up questions.<br /><br /><strong>4 Polar Icebreaker Construction<br /></strong><br />This RFI seeks to identify available US shipyards with adequate facilities or the ability to enhance current infrastructure to build at least one heavy polar icebreaker. For heavy icebreaker construction, the shipyard must have the capability of utilizing approximately 1-3/4" (71# plate) steel. <br /><br />A candidate facility will have the required infrastructure to construct an icebreaker similar in size to the USCGC Polar Star. Dimensions for the USCGC Polar Star are:<br /><br />Displacement (Full Load)<br />&bull; 13402 tonnes <br />&bull; (13190.3 (uk) t) <br />&bull; (14773.2 t (short)) <br />Length<br />&bull; 121.6 m (399.0 ft)<br />Beam<br />&bull; 25.6 m (84.0 ft)<br />Draught<br />&bull; 9.8 m (32.2 ft)<br /><br />Interested parties are requested to submit the following information:<br />&bull; Description of US Shipbuilding Facility<br />&nbsp; o Location<br />&nbsp; o Manufacturing Capabilities<br />&nbsp; o List of Representative Past Projects<br />&bull; Facility Enhancements Required to Build a Polar Icebreaker (If Applicable)<br />&bull; Lead time to Enhance Infrastructure (If Applicable)<br /><br />Responses will only be accepted from US Shipyard facilities.<br /><br /><strong>5 Additional Notes</strong><br /><br />This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Heidi Shorter, Chula Vista, CA.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Spatial Orientation Center (SOC), Naval Medical Center San Diego requires technical support for experiments concerning blast overpressure effects on traumatic brain injury and effects of exposures to continuous and impulsive noise on hearing and balance in a rodent model. <br>The services required are:<br>o technical support for research proposals and protocols<br>o experiments to evaluate process of blast-induced neurological injury and of noise induced hearing loss <br>o treatments and/or prevention of blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury and inner ear injury<br>o application of expertise of small animal models to blast overpressure and noise induced biochemical oxidative stress<br>o employ methodologies to evaluate investigational agents and compounds to protect/restore neurological and cognitive function to blast-induced injury<br>o surgical preparation and implantation of devices and methods to repairing or renewal of sensory tissues to return or recover function<br>o Collect and record data from investigations and maintain the experimental database<br>o Logistic support and recordkeeping for studies with the Animal Research Coordinator.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>Heidi Shorter has been involved in work with small animal models as an animal care specialist at the NMCSD animal facility. She has knowledge of the programs utilized by the SOC in determining behavioral, physiological, and cellular response mechanisms to blast overpressure and biochemical oxidative stress using small animal models. Heidi Shorter has monitored materials, supplies and animal inventories and has participated at various investigations at the NMCSD animal facility. As an animal care specialist she has employed various methodologies and procedures under Protocol CIP#NMCSD.2009.003 and CIP#NMCSD.2009.009. She is experienced in performing surgery on small and large animals for various NMCSD departments. The time to train a new animal research technician to perform on par with Heidi Shorter would hinder any new and ongoing developments by the SOC.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned no small businesses associated with both the NAICS 541690 and any of the keywords animal research, rodent models, audiological.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>None<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>None<br><br>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than 12:00 PM (EST) December 21, 2011.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-6180<br>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<DESC><strong>Subject: </strong><br />CCH TeamMate Audit Management System Software<br /><strong>Notice Type: </strong><br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source<br /><strong><br />Background:<br /></strong><br />The Department of Commerce (DOC) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has a requirement to renew the TeamMate Audit Management System Software license currently being used.  The OIG Audit and Evaluation Team currently uses this software to document, review audit workpapers and create audit reports.  OIG has been using this system for over 12 years and the software license must be supported in order to continue successful use of the software.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District intends to modify an existing contract on a sole source basis under the authority for FAR 6.302-1(c) with Roscoe Allen Company, HWY 129 South Ocilla, GA 31774, a follow on contract for Lease Agreement for Building 506A and Snack Trailer, MacDill AFB, FL.  The Government anticipates extending the period of performance for an additional twelve-month of services through 31 March 2014.  Also, an additional twelve months of performance may be exercised at the discretion of the Government through 21 March 2015.  Roscoe Allen Company was awarded the previous 8(a) contract which will expire 21 March 2013 to provide temporary office modular buildings/trailers at MacDill AFB, FL.  It is considered to be in the best interest of the Government to continue the lease of the existing building.  Lease of the existing building will reduce costs by eliminating costs for removal of the building, moving expenses for tenants, and procurement and installation of another temporary facility.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All questions should be emailed to Shirley Hooker, at shirley.y.hooker@.usace.army.mil and copied to jacalyn.m.jenkins@usace.army.mil.

<p>Intent to Sole Source</p>
<p>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to negotiate a contract, on a sole source basis, with Xtreme Alternative Defense Systems (XADS), 1508 E 7th ST Anderson, IN 46012. The resultant contract will provide design, development, and production services to modify 8 existing Tarantula Counter Improvised Explosive Device (CIED) systems. The Tarantula Counter IED system utilizes a vehicle mounted generator to develop an electrical discharge to initiate or neutralize buried IEDs. This contract action will correct system deficiencies and provide system enhancements to 8 existing prototype systems and provide spares to support an operational assessment in Operation Enduring Freedom.</p>
<p>The total estimated dollar value for this procurement is not to exceed $6M.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is intended to be directed to XADS pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-2 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" and Unusual and Compelling Urgency as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii) and FAR 6.302-2. These prototype systems were originally provided to MARCORSYSCOM through a U.S. Army developmental effort and require improvements to meet critical mission requirements. The original prime contract, W9113M-05-C-0219, awarded by the Army to ITT Excelis, was awarded through competition. ITT Excelis subsequently sub-contracted to XADS to conduct technology development and XADS delivered 8 prototype systems to the Army resultant from their development efforts. These 8 systems were subsequently transferred from the Army to MARCORSYSCOM.</p>
<p>XADS has asserted proprietary data rights to all necessary technical data for the systems, and is the sole producer of the Tarantula system. In order to meet current user requirements and delivery schedule, the systems originally delivered to the government must have improvements designed and incorporated to be suitable for deployment in a short period of time. Based on the continued development of this highly specialized equipment, award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs (which could not be recovered through competition) and unacceptable delays in fulfilling MARCORSYSCOM requirements (see FAR 6.302-l(a)(2)(ii)). The government only retains limited rights for the Tarantula data and technical data provided by XADS is restricted to government use and is not available for distribution in any form to any entity outside of government personnel.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The points of contact for this notice are Ms. Michelle Miller at michelle.miller1@usmc.mil, Ms. Emily Voskoyan at emily.voskoyan@usmc.mil, and Ms. Suzanne Blagg at suzanne.blagg@usmc.mil. Any questions regarding this posting are due by 1400 EST 7 February 2013. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see Subpart 32.11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the CCR database" means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service, and has marked the records ``Active.'' The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-</p>
<p>(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR PART 13.106 for the requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation number is 1113351 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).<br /><br />RESPONSE DATE: 2/11/2013
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-65 effective January 29, 2013.<br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; FSC Code is 6640. Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. Acquisition is unrestricted.<br />Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. <br />REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Part I: General Information</p>
<p>A. Introduction</p>
<p>Characterization of bio-conjugated nanoparticles and detection/quantification of oligonucleotides/proteins/peptides are crucial for development of ultrasensitive viral pathogen diagnostic methods for and the research of blood borne pathogens and emerging diseases. Recently the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) acquired an Agilent 7100A Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) instrument equipped with an Agilent Ultraviolet-Diode Array Detector (UV-DAD) for use in this research work. The sensitivity of the UV-DAD detector is insufficient for identifying picomolar/femtomolar levels of samples. To further enhance the capability of the CE system, the FDA/CBER requires a Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Detector.<br /><br />B. Background</p>
<p>The CE technique provides ultrahigh resolution and great separation speed for a broad range of complex biological samples found in life sciences such as nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, pharmaceutical compounds, nanoparticles, viruses and cells. However, the sensitivity of the standard CE detector, UV-DAD, is insufficient for identifying samples with concentrations at or below picomolar levels, which greatly hinders efforts on the study of HIV, influenza and viruses from other emerging diseases, discovery of related biomarkers, and development of ultrasensitive diagnostic tools against the pathogens. A typical LIF detector, however, is up to 100,000 times more sensitive than UV detection. The significantly higher sensitivity of the LIF detector makes it highly desirable for sensitively and selectively detecting low-abundance analytes in complex biological matrixes, and thus greatly benefits the CE method development/validation, nanoparticle bio-conjugate characterization and general clinical research.</p>
<p>C. Scope</p>
<p>An ultrasensitive LIF detector is important to the CE study of pathogens and rapid identification of oligonucleotides, proteins, small compounds and nano/micrometer-sized particles. The LIF detector together with the existing Agilent 7100A CE system will be employed in the characterization of bio-conjugated nanoparticles, analysis of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) products and peptides/proteins/antibodies from HIV/influenza or other viruses, as well as the discovery of nucleic acid/peptide/protein biomarkers for diagnosis of blood borne pathogens in existing and emerging diseases.</p>
<p>Part II: Work Requirements<br /><br />A. Technical requirements:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work
<p>For 196th IN BDE March 2013 103rd Civil Support Team (CST) Collective Training Event (CTE) FTX "ORCA"</p>
<p>1.0 Objective: The objective of the task is to assist and execute 36 hour, full scale, Joint CST, Chemical/Biological/Radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction Collective Training exercises in Sitka, Alaska from 25-29 March 2013. Exercises will create an environment to facilitate the accurate assessment of the twelve National Guard Mission Essential Tasks outlined in the DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks dated May 09. This exercise involves the 93d (HI), 94th (GU), and 103rd CST (AK).</p>
<p>2.0 Specific Tasks: The contractor will provide the necessary, personnel, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment as indicated below to perform the tasks outlined:<br />2.1 Scenario Development-The CTEs will not only measure the training and readiness level of the team in accordance with DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks, but will also reinforce interoperability, communications, and RIP/TOA procedures and aid in the development of standard operating guidelines (SOGs). The scenarios must include at least one (1) Chemical, one (1) Biological, and one (1) Radiological hazard that will allow each team to challenge all of their capabilities and equipment. The scenarios should be designed to aid in the identification of possible team shortcomings and weak areas, and to re-train those areas as necessary. It must also provide an environment ready for on-the-fly injects as necessary to ensure all of the DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks are completed to standard. Should any weak areas be found, the scenario should provide for immediate re-training in those areas. The scenario must provide the complexity and realism to represent an actual Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) event. Contractor provides realistic training aid, devices, and simulators that properly stimulate current CST detection and analytical equipment enabling the CST to make sophisticated assessments and decisions. Realism and technical exactitude are crucial for all training aid, devices, simulators, and locations. The full scenario should provide for one complete and continuous demanding day of training not to exceed 36 hours.<br />2.2 Scenario Staffing- The contractor will provide experienced and certified staff to create target sites that replicate elaborate chemical and biological laboratory production, radiological and explosives manufacturing labs, and act as role players in the scenario. The minimal roles include Incident Commander (IC), FBI or local law enforcement, Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Safety Officer, Staging Officer, and Medical reach back. All staff must have a full<br />understanding of the Incident Command System (ICS) and their role in WMD event. Since staff will be playing the roles of trained Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) professionals and reacting to the decisions of the CST, they must be fully trained and possess at least 10 years of experience in HAZMAT operations to the level of "Technician" in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 472. As these exercises are to assist in SOG construction and implementation, as well as reinforce Training and Evaluation Tasks enforced at a national certification level, prior participation in at least three (3) national level training exercises to include having executed at least (5) CST External Evaluations (EXEVAL) is vital to plenary understanding of the training requirements. All staff must be well versed in CST Operations and all governing regulations to supplement the training and reinforcement of standard CST operating principals during the exercise. The contractor will possess a certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and basic skills in electrical, plumbing, and carpentry for target site adjustments (see 3.1 and 3.2 below)</p>
<p>3.0 Place of Performance. The contractor ensures locations/buildings meet the requirements for target location, vehicle footprint, communications equipment, egress, and functioning utilities (electricity, water supply) in accordance with the DTMS Combined Armed Training Strategy (CATS) Civil Support Team Mission Essential Tasks dated, FM 3-11.22, and unit Standard Operating Guidelines (SOG).<br />3.1 Target Site. The contractor will prepare the target sites as necessary to enhance the realism of the scenario. Provide no less than (10) casualty role players with the proper casualty simulation makeup. Contractor must possess the appropriate commercial driver license (CDL) to operate and transport hazardous materials which require warning placards. The contractor will possess the skill set required to perform basic plumbing, carpentry, paint and finish, and electrical work (not requiring permit) to adequately prepare target buildings or, must be able to obtain such services as necessary to insure a realistic training environment. All furniture, decorations, props, chemical toilets (with servicing) will also be provided by the contractor.<br />3.2 Site Adjustments. Any necessary adjustments to the site (to include building construction, inoperable vehicle placement, demolition, fabrications) will be made by the contractor. Contractor will be required to improve/modify (2) abandoned structures acquired for the exercise. The buildings are approximately 2000 sq ft in size and are at 25% disrepair. Moderate construction within the buildings will be required, such as: secret room construction, false walls, doors and windows installation, repair or removal. All modification will be required and driven based on the scenario. Minor changes not requiring monetary adjustment may be directed by the COTR or individual designated by the Contracting Officer (KO). Any changes requiring monetary increases must be directed by the KO. At the<br />conclusion of the exercise, the contractor will return the site to its previous state. All clean-up will be done by the contractor.</p>
<p>4.0 Period of Performance. It is estimated that ten (10) days will be needed to complete the task with seven (7) days for preparation of elaborate chemical, biological, radiological, and explosives labs, two (2) days for execution, and one (1) day for clean-up.</p>

Responses to this offer are required in electronic format.  Offerors shall ensure that the evaluation factors identified herein are adequately addressed in their proposal submissions.  The overall proposal shall consist of three (3) physically separate parts, individually titled Parts 1, 2, and 3.

NOTE:  Offers submitted on NECO will be rejected as Non-Responsive.  An offer may be submitted through e-mail.  No mailed copy will be accepted.  E-mail to charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

  (i)    	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 
  (ii)   	PAST PERFORMANCE
(iii)	MEETING THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATES
(iv)	PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), (iii) and (iv).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly more important than Factor (iv), PRICE and (iii) Meeting The Required Delivery Dates.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

Factor (i) - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 

Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items and/or services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Therefore, offeror shall provide information that clearly demonstrated experience in performance on similar requirements.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

A list of technically acceptable/unacceptable ratings is listed below:

Technically Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings
Rating	Description
Acceptable	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

Factor (ii) - PAST PERFORMANCE 

Information submitted as required by SECTION L Past Performance, will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.
  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

Evaluation of Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE is as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

Factor (iii)  Meeting The Required Delivey Dates

Award will be made to the responsible offeror that is rated outstanding or satisfactory in meeting the required delivery dates and offers the lowest price.
 

Factor (iv)  Price

Award will be made to the responsible offeror that is rated outstanding or satisfactory in Past Performance and offers the lowest price. 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from price.

All responsible Offerors are to submit CAGE code, Dunn and Bradstreet number, Tax Identification Number and all applicable specifications regarding this solicitation. 

Proposal must be received no later than 12:00 PM (PST), 07 Feb 2013, Quotes submitted as an attachment to an email should be sent in Word Version 6.0 or higher.
 Do not mail. Only electronic responses shall be accepted via e-mail.  Each submission should be virus scanned prior to being sent via e-mail to the POC listed: Charles E. Fletcher II email: charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil .  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice questions must be submitted via e-mail. The Government will make every attempt to answer all questions in a timely manner; however, questions submitted within 3 days of the posted closing day may not allow ample time to respond and offerors cannot be guaranteed a response will be issued.  

NOTE: Email submissions are subject to size and type restrictions (typically limited to less than 1 Megabyte in size and only non-executable attachments such as .doc or .pdf files) as well as any other appropriate network security measures.
  It is the respondent's responsibility to verify the package was received and can be viewed.

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have
been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on
your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if
this is an item you have never made.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS
submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required
by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award
under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval
request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based
on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification
Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

Volume of Department of Defense (DOD) contract awards the Contractor has received and has active actions on in the last twelve (12) months.  <br> Priority of past performance information requested:  1.) If available, submit Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluations ratings.  2.) For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs). <br>  <br> a.	ACASS Evaluations <br>  <br> Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm. <br>  <br> There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement. <br>  <br> b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) <br>  <br> The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. <br>  <br> Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above). <br>  <br> c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance <br>  <br> The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror. <br>  <br> While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror. <br>  <br> d.	The Government will give the awardee(s) an Option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.  <br>   <br> Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions <br>  <br>  <br> i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement): <br>  <br> 	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated. <br>  <br> 	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.   <br>  <br> 	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.   <br>  <br> 	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted. <br> 	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award. <br>  <br> Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br>  <br> ii.	Definitions: <br>  <br> Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract. <br>  <br> Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. <br>  <br> Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information <br>  <br> i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.  Part I, Part II and Sections of the submitted SF330 information (reference SF330 instructions for definitions of Part I, Part II and Sections) of each copy shall be separated by tabs (dividers) and clearly marked.  Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II. <br>  <br> FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.  FOR SUBCONTRACTORS/SUBCONSULTANTS, PROVIDE THESE FIRMS' DUNS NUMBERS AND CAGE CODES IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK C, BOX 9. <br>  <br> All proposers, including joint-ventures, must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM)  at https://www.sam.gov and have completed their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) section. <br>  <br> All proposals submitted will become, upon receipt, the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed. <br>  <br> ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be up to two possible small business contracts awarded as a result of negotiations.  Each contract will have $3 million capacity and a period of performance of 5 years.   <br>  <br> iii.

Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm. <br>  <br> There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement. <br>  <br> b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) <br>  <br> The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. <br>  <br> Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above). <br>  <br> c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance <br>  <br> The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror. <br>  <br> While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror. <br>  <br> d.	 The Government will give the awardee an option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work. <br>  <br> Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions <br>  <br>  <br> i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement): <br>  <br> 	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated. <br>  <br> 	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.   <br>  <br> 	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.   <br>  <br> 	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted. <br> 	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award. <br>  <br> Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br>  <br> ii.	Definitions: <br>  <br> Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract. <br>  <br> Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br>  <br> Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. <br>  <br> Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information <br>  <br> i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.

After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed. <br>  <br> ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be one contract awarded as a result of negotiations.  The contract will have $3 million capacity and a period of performance of 5 years.  <br>  <br> iii.	Completed SF 330 information must reach the Contracting Division Offices not later than 2:00 p.m. (Central/local time) on Friday, 01-Mar-2013.

On the date specified and for thirty (30) minutes prior to the specified time, a Contracting representative will be in the lobby of the building at the above address to receive offers. Containers (e.g. envelopes, packages, boxes) will be screened for security purposes.  Hand-carried means the individual must be able to carry on their person.  If due to size or volume, packages or boxes need to be wheeled in on a cart or dolly, you will be required to go to the dock area located on the northeast side of the facility. After inspection and screening, you will be allowed in the building after presenting valid photo identification.  At the offer due date/time specified above, it will be announced that receipt of proposals is closed. Official time will be established by a clock designated by the Contracting representative receiving hand-carried proposals, to be located in the area of proposals being received.  Recent terrorist threats have resulted in more time-consuming sign-in and escort procedures and may impact the timely delivery of offers.  This instruction shall also apply to those proposals delivered through a delivery or parcel service.  NOTE:  No parking on the street in front of the facility entrances will be allowed.  Passenger vehicles will need to locate parking meters or parking garages before delivering proposals.  Delivery trucks must go to the dock.  The vehicle will be inspected and packages screened at the dock.  After inspection and screening, the delivery person will be allowed into the building. <br>  <br> Requests for in-person visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be scheduled.

<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>

(End of provision)<br />(xx) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Coast Guard Acquisition Procedures (CGAP)<br />APPENDIX C - CHAPTER 3033 <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />It is anticipated that a non-competitive purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>

No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>

The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to Mali.  The incumbent might also have to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel for indefinite periods until the situation in Mali is stabilized.  Incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in Mali.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the DCHA/OTI's Mali country program.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Mali will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Mali by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be technically acceptable or has unacceptable past performance the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is determined to be acceptable for both technical and past performance, or until all offerors are evaluated.<br />Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving camera surveillance systems that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     <br>  <br> Please see attached amendment. <br>      <br>   The decrease in training activities at Grafenw hr Training Area (GTA) renders the suppression of woody vegetation in open areas more difficult.

<DESC>Thursday, January 31, 2013<br />BBGCON1313-R-0001 - Sana Et Pakistani
<p>Questions and Answers:</p>
<p>Q: Please clarify the terms &lsquo;agent' and &lsquo;principle' [sic]; by principle do you mean the networks in Pakistan?</p>
<p><br /><em>A: The term &lsquo;agent' refers to an individual that acts as an intermediate for a broadcasting network. All proposals submitted for consideration must be from a broadcasting network.  Proposals submitted by an agent on behalf of a broadcasting network will not be considered.<br />The term &lsquo;principal' refers to the primary source or company submitting a proposal. The principal in this solicitation is a full-time executive within the broadcasting network authorized to sign a binding contract on behalf of his or her company with the VOA.<br />The solicitation specifies a popular television network in Pakistan with nationwide coverage -terrestrial, direct-to-home satellite or cable. The principal therefore (1) must have a physical presence in Pakistan; (2) must have a broadcasting footprint in the country of Pakistan to be considered.</em></p>
<p><br />Q: Is Tax Payer ID Number and CCR registration required for bidders who are based outside the USA?</p>
<p><br /><em>A: Regarding the requirement for a Tax Payer ID Number, please refer to FAR 52.212-3 which states:<br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br /></em></p>
<p><em>Regarding CCR registration (now sam.gov), Offeror shall provide proof of registration in CCR database or documentation supporting the applicability of an exemption to register under FAR 4.1102 which states:</em></p>
<p><em>4.1102 Policy. <br />(a) Prospective contractors shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award of a contract or agreement, except for- <br />(1) Purchases under the micro-purchase threshold that use a Governmentwide commercial purchase card as both the purchasing and payment mechanism, as opposed to using the purchase card for payment only; <br />(2) Classified contracts (see 2.101) when registration in the CCR database, or use of CCR data, could compromise the safeguarding of classified information or national security; <br />(3) Contracts awarded by- <br />(i) Deployed contracting officers in the course of military operations, including, but not limited to, contingency operations as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) or humanitarian or peacekeeping operations as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2302(7); or<br />(ii) Contracting officers located outside the United States and its outlying areas, as defined in 2.101, for work to be performed in support of diplomatic or developmental operations, including those performed in support of foreign assistance programs overseas, in an area that has been designated by the Department of State as a danger pay post (see http:// aoprals.state.gov/Web920/danger_pay_all.asp); or <br />(iii) Contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to natural or environmental disasters or national or civil emergencies, e.g., Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121); <br />(4) Contracts with individuals for performance outside the United States and its outlying areas; <br />(5) Contracts to support unusual or compelling needs (see 6.302-2); <br />(6) Contract actions at or below $25,000 awarded to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States, if it is impractical to obtain CCR registration; and <br />(7) Micro-purchases that do not use the electronic funds transfer (EFT) method for payment and are not required to be reported (see Subpart 4.6). <br />(b) If practical, the contracting officer shall modify the contract or agreement awarded under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to require CCR registration. <br />(c) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the contractor shall provide the responsible contracting officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to change the name in the CCR database; comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible contracting officer. The contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of the clause at 52.204-13, Central Contractor Registration Maintenance, or fails to perform the agreement at 52.204-13, paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C), and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the contractor to be other than the contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of the contract. <br />(2) The contractor shall not change the name or address for electronic funds transfer payments (EFT) or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). <br />(3) Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of the contract. </em></p>
<p>Q: Will you accept other items in the proposal that are outside the specific scope?</p>
<p><br /><em>A: All proposals must comply with all requirements set forth in the solicitation. Offerors are welcome to submit multiple proposals that comply with the requirements of the solicitation.</em></p>
<p><br />Q: The solicitation refers to broadcast on Thursday and Friday. Will this show air two (2), fresh episodes per week?</p>
<p><br /><em>A: SANA will air two (2) fresh episodes per week. Repeats of the programs shall be aired at no additional cost.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><br />Q: Can we edit the program to reduce its duration. The doc says 24 minutes of content with 5 minutes of ads/promo space in 2 breaks. We normally sell more advertising than that. Can we edit the content in conjunction with VOA to accommodate its programming format?</p>
<p><br /><em>A: No.  All proposals must comply with all requirements set forth in the solicitation. Offerors are welcome to submit multiple proposals that comply with the requirements of the solicitation.</em></p>
<p><br />Q: Does VOA have a preference on satellite versus Internet delivery of the content or will it depend on our normal processes and facility to accept the content?</p>
<p><br /><em>A:  No preference. </em></p>
<p>Q: If the authorities in Pakistan have any issues with the program and require it to be edited, censored or stopped-will we be allowed to make judicious decisions on minor edits or will all changes requested by the Pakistan government have to come back to VOA for decision?</p>
<p><br /><em>A: VOA and the Broadcaster would need to jointly agree upon the edits.</em></p>

Volume of Department of Defense (DOD) contract awards the Contractor has received and has active actions on in the last twelve (12) months.   <br>  Priority of past performance information requested:  1.) If available, submit Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluations ratings.  2.) For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs).  <br>    <br>  a.	ACASS Evaluations  <br>    <br>  Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.  <br>    <br>  There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.  <br>    <br>  b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)  <br>    <br>  The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  <br>    <br>  Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).  <br>    <br>  c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance  <br>    <br>  The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.  <br>    <br>  While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.  <br>    <br>  d.	The Government will give the awardee(s) an Option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.   <br>     <br>  Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions  <br>    <br>    <br>  i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):  <br>    <br>  	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.  <br>    <br>  	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.    <br>    <br>  	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.    <br>    <br>  	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.  <br>  	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award.  <br>    <br>  Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  <br>    <br>  ii.	Definitions:  <br>    <br>  Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.  <br>    <br>  Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  <br>    <br>  Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.  <br>    <br>  Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information  <br>    <br>  i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.

Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II.  <br>    <br>  FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.  FOR SUBCONTRACTORS/SUBCONSULTANTS, PROVIDE THESE FIRMS' DUNS NUMBERS AND CAGE CODES IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK C, BOX 9.  <br>    <br>  All proposers, including joint-ventures, must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM)  at https://www.sam.gov and have completed their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) section.  <br>    <br>  All proposals submitted will become, upon receipt, the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.  <br>    <br>  ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be up to two possible small business contracts awarded as a result of negotiations.  Each contract will have $3 million capacity and a period of performance of 5 years.    <br>    <br>  iii.

Is there a gradation/ sieve analysis you are looking for? <br>   <br> A1: The USACE requirement is as stated in the SOW.  The fill must meet the New York DEC residential use standard.  Offerors should also submit gradation analysis for informational purposes. <br>  <br> Q2. Who is responsible for constructing the stockpile? Do we need to place a piece of machinery on site to establish the stockpile or is this accomplished by others? <br>  <br>  <br> A2. Stockpile of fill material to be staged and managed by others.  Contractors transport vehicles will be loaded by others.  <br>  <br> Q3.  What are the Proposal Submission Requirements? See no reference to separate volumes with Technical and Past <br>  <br> A3. Contractor should submit required documents for technical review and a price proposal.  There is no Technical Evaluation Board for this action, so the proposal does not need to be submitted in separate volumes.

<p><strong>SEE ATTACHED PDF TITLED "TERMS AND CONDITIONS - HSCG38-11-Q-500056" FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA. </strong></p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to rescind Amendment 1, require contractors to submit written proposals, revise the specification, and revise the evaluation criteria for award.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Amendment 0001 dated 30 JAN 2013 is rescinded in its entirety.</p>
<p>2. The original Combined Synopsis-Solicitation posted on 17 JAN 2013 is revised to require submission of a written proposal consisting of three (3) volumes as follows:</p>
<p>Volume 1: Technical Factors. Offerors shall submit written information addressing the following Technical Factors:<br />1. Experience installing the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator in marine applications. <br />2. Access to or ability to obtain complete technical data for the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator from the manufacturer, Atlas Incinerators A/S; provide documentation of possession of the data or written verification from Atlas Incinerators that states they will make all technical data regarding the Vesta ASWI 204 AS incinerator available for use by the contractor.</p>
<p>Volume 2: Relevant Past Performance<br />Offerors shall submit at least 3 relevant past performance references for contracts with private industry or government instrumentalities (federal, state, or local) for servicing Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerators) performed within the last 3 years. References shall include:<br />1. Name &amp; contact information of the point of contract (PM/COR) <br />2. Name of Organization <br />3. A brief description of service <br />4.

<p>Volume 3: Price<br />Offerors shall submit price proposals IAW the CLIN structure below.. The offer shall include their Dun and Bradstreet Number and a statement whether their company is registered in SAM (www.sam.gov).<br />CLIN: 00001 Description: - CGC HEALY Incinerator Assessment
<p>tiny_mce_marker</p>
___________________________</p>
<p>The length of the total proposal inclusive of all volumes shall be no greater than 15 pages.</p>
<p>3. The original Statement of Work is deleted and the attached Statement of Work "HEALY Incinerator Assessment, Revision 1" is substituted in its place. All work shall be performed in accordance with the HEALY Incinerator Assessment, Revision 1.</p>
<p>4. Paragraph 15, Evaluation, is revised to read as follows:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) is as supplemented below:<br />This is a best value acquisition using the trade-off approach. The USCG intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price IDIQ Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsive, responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government. Selection and award of a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order will be based on, in descending order of importance, 1) Technical Factors, 2) Relevant Past Performance, and 3) Price. Technical Factors is considered to be more important than Past Performance; however when Technical Factors and Past Performance are combined they are significantly more important than price. As the Technical Factors and Relevant Past Performance ratings converge, price may become more important.<br />The USCG will evaluate the offers that meet the requirements of the solicitation against the following evaluation criteria: <br />Factor 1 - Technical Factors: The Government will evaluate each offeror's technical proposal to determine their capacity to meet all the requirements outlined in the specification. The following technical factors apply:<br />1. Experience installing the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator in marine applications. <br />2. Access to or ability to obtain complete technical data for the Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator from the manufacturer, Atlas Incinerators A/S; provide documentation of possession of the data or written verification from Atlas Incinerators that states they will make all technical data regarding the Vesta ASWI 204 AS incinerator available for use by the contractor.<br />Factor 2- Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for contracts to service Vesta ASWI 204 AS Incinerator. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant. <br />Factor 3 - Price: The offeror shall propose a fixed price for performing the HEALY Incinerator Assessment.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE EBDZ-MCF-001, AMENDMENT 01
<p>AFLCMC/EBDZ will host a Modernized Commodity Fuze Industry Day at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on 14-15 November 2012. Only companies deemed eligible to receive the Technical Data Package (see Paragraph 7 of the RFI) may attend. A general information session will convene at 0800 Central Standard Time, 14 November in the Eglin Conference Center and is expected to last about 2 hours. Following this session, the government will meet with companies individually upon request. The purpose of these individual breakout meetings is to allow for discussion of company proprietary or sensitive materials or concerns. Any questions coming out of these information exchanges may, at the government's discretion, be sanitized and provided along with answers to all Industry Day attendees afterward.</p>
<p>Companies interested in attending the MCF Industry Day must provide notification NLT 1500 CT, Thursday, 25 October, to Mr. Erik Urban at erik.urban@eglin.af.mil and Ms. Trisha Brinton at trisha.brinton@eglin.af.mil. If a one-on-one session with the government is desired, include that request as part of the notification. Because individual sessions must be scheduled in advance, they will only be available to those companies requesting them prior to the deadline. Following receipt of notification from companies, the government will provide information about base access requirements and, if requested, scheduled time for the one-on-one. Attendance will be limited to no more than 5 people per company. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS INDUSTRY DAY OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>Clarification to paragraph 5c: Release of MIL-STD-1316F has been delayed with no estimate of release date, thus a version cannot be supplied at this time. Please revert to the latest published version "E" and be advised of the Air Force and Navy safety communities' intent to reinstate the requirement for a visual safe /arm indication for an electromechanical fuze (a major purpose for version "F" of the standard). A discussion of this requirement will be provided during the Industry Day general session.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE EBDZ-MCF-001, AMENDMENT 02 TO THE RFI ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 18 SEPTEMBER 2012<br />ADDITIONAL MCF QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY<br /><br />1. The government's need for a modernized fuze is based on an assumption that the industrial supplier base will not be able to provide affordable, high quality components for the current Electro-mechanical design over the long-term (20+ years). What is your perspective on this assumption? <br /><br />2. General Industry consensus is there would be a substantial cost increase if the captive carry requirement is changed from 100 external/200 internal to 900 hours. What does industry consider a reasonable captive carriage hour requirement that optimizes cost/schedule impact? Does the fuze or the FZU design drive the extended captive carriage costs/schedule, or both equally?<br /><br />3. If the government deleted the long function delay time requirement, explain to what extent that would lower your development and production costs?<br /><br />4. If the government eliminated the FFCS requirement, how would that impact your projected cost and schedule for developing the fuze?<br /><br />5. Considering the need for affordability, at what quantity (or quantities) would sharp increases in unit price begin to occur? Why? What strategies are there to lessen these increases?<br /><br />6. As part of the acquisition strategy, the government is considering options to include testing of the performance of prototype fuze systems as part of the source selection process. This could either be part of the basic proposal evaluation, or it could involve a rolling down select to 2-3 suppliers for a 12-18 month demonstration effort to a final downselect. Key evaluations points will be current FMU-152A/B specification performance with hardened target capability and multi-layer survivability. How long would it take you to provide 10 test items for evaluation? What would be the ROM cost for those test items?<br /><br />7. What are your thoughts on industrial base impacts of a joint modernization program with the Navy; versus two separate programs, Air Force and Navy?<br />

<DESC>W15QKN-12-R-E013					W15QKN-13-R-E013 <br>  <br> QUESTION: Reference - The posting for RFP W15QKN-12-R-E013 indicates that the contract will be for the acquisition of Commercial Services with incidental supplies  The PWS for T0 0001 indicates that satisfactory completion cannot be achieved without designing, testing and delivering an RF Subsystem that meets a detailed set of requirements.  Is the RF Subsystem an incidental supply item or is T0 0001 a fixed price supply task order for a commercial item? <br> RESPONSE: The contract allows for the delivery of material and hardware. This item is considered hardware. <br> QUESTION: Is there any Proprietary Data associated with the NGATS RF Microwave Frequency Support? <br> RESPONSE: There is no proprietary data associated with this task. <br> QUESTION: Para 4.3.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall support all current and future requirements <br> Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall support all current and known future requirements <br> RESPONSE:  We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies. <br> QUESTION: Para 4.3.1.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall assure all current and future systems are addressed. <br> Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall assure all current and known future systems are addressed. <br> RESPONSE: We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies. <br> QUESTION: Para 4.23.1 of the TASK01 PWS states All data delivered to the Government shall be unlimited. All markings contrary to this and existing in the TDP shall be removed before delivery. <br> Recommend above wording be changed to the following: The Government shall have unlimited rights to data that is developed under this contract. <br> RESPONSE:   Noted. The wording is not changed. <br> QUESTION: <br> BASIC PWS Para 4.3.2 states The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible. <br> Recommend above wording be changed as follows: The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software to the greatest extent possible, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible. <br> RESPONSE:   Proprietary information is not to be submitted. The wording will not be changed. <br> QUESTION: <br> TASK 01 PWS Paragraph 4.20.1 states One complete set of technical data suitable for recomplete for the all prototype hardware shall be delivered. The design of the hardware product baseline shall be documented through the use of engineering data. The TDP shall conform to data item description, DI-SESS-8100D (CDRL A008), Product Drawings/Models and Associated Lists. <br> Recommend that the recomplete level TDP be defined on a task-by-task basis to ensure prototype efforts are timely and affordable. <br> RESPONSE:   Noted, will be defined with what level of data is required. <br> QUESTION: There appears to be a discrepancy between the Labor Category and Rates Table in Section L and the Labor Category Descriptions file. The table lists labor category G Software Engineer, while there is no labor category description. <br> RESPONSE:  The Labor Category Description file will be revised. <br> QUESTION: <br> FIRST TASK ORDER <br> Will we have access to an NGATS system software, in order to integrate the new hardware? <br> RESPONSE: Yes the software will be made available if required. <br> QUESTION: This should be covered by a general statement that it needs re-work. <br> RESPONSE:  The comment is unclear. Unable to provide a response. <br> QUESTION: For paragraph 4.14.1 (PWSFirstTask.doc):   Requires the contractor to supply an integration log book (CDRL A007) for the RF sub-system [at paragraph 4.14.2].  However, the description for CDRL A007 is for a TPS Integration Log book.  What is the Governments expectation for the content, format, etc of an RF Subsystem integration log book? <br> RESPONSE:  This is an error and will be corrected. The log book will be in contractor format and specified in the CDRL. <br> QUESTION: In Section 5.3.1 one of the future ATE Systems listed is ARGCS.  What is the role that ARGCS will play in the US Army Standard Family of Testers? <br> RESPONSE: The ARGCS was an evaluation/demonstration project. It will not be part of the IFTE family of Testers. <br> QUESTION: From the time of the Sources Sought, until now at Draft RFP, the EO/IR Hardware Requirements and the IRWindows Software requirements have been dropped.  Is it to be assumed there will be no EO/IR type activities implemented on this IDIQ? <br> RESPONSE:  The EO requirement has been put back into the basic PWS. <br> QUESTION: FIRST TASK ORDER <br> What type of Acceptance test will be required, for the first task? e.g.Will there be TPS's that need to be integrated with the RF subsystem. <br> RESPONSE: No. Functional testing to verify the subsystem meets the requirements. 10/03/12 IPT: Joe Cuccaro to review and provide a response. The first task will most likely be de-scoped to eliminate the prototype delivery. <br> QUESTION: It appears that an update is required for the data in the tables of paragraph 4.3.

<DESC>The Mission & Installation Contracting Command- Fort Dix intends to solicit & award an acquisition for lodging services in the Columbus, Ohio area. 40 double occupancy rooms for eight nights.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide the requested services. The place of performance is within 10 miles from Port Columbus International Airport, Columbus, OH. The period of performance for this effort is from 28 Feburary-8 March 2013. The resultant contract is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price type contract. This acquisition is issued as a 100% Small Business Set Aside under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 721110 and the related small business size standard of $30 million.   <br>  This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable).  <br>  This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for quote/proposal. Solicitation Number W911S1-13-T-0066 is assigned for reference purposes. The entire solicitation will be made available on or about 31 January 2013 via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.  The required response date will be stated in the solicitation. The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-62.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to review the web page for notice of amendments, updates, or changes to the solicitation.  Please be advised that hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available; you must download solicitation documents from the ASFI.  All potential sources must obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code, and register in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ in order to transact business with the government. Failure to obtain a DUNS number, a CAGE code and register in the SAM may result in the delay of award of a contract or possible award to the next otherwise successful offeror. For further information, please contact Michael Eskarous, Contract Specialist at michael.eskarous.civ@mail.mil

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of the notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>Background.The National Institution of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) was deeded the South Campus location on June 26, 1967, by the Research Triangle Foundation (RTF). The NIEHS has only a proprietary interest in this land. This in effect means that although the Federal Government (NIEHS) has acquired title to this area in North Carolina, it has not obtained any measure of the State's authority over the area. This finding mandates that all contractors operating on all NIEHS property, leased or owned, in Durham County must adhere to all state and local requirements (i.e. building permits, etc). The NIEHS is one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) principal Federal Agency for biomedical research on the health effects of environmental agents.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective.The NIEHS purpose and need for the proposed requirement is to award and IDIQ contract for (i) Chemical Waste Disposal; (ii) Radioactive Waste Disposal; and (iii) Mixed Waste Disposal.</p>
<p>Project Requirement.The NIEHS is seeking all capable and qualified organizations to fully provide comprehensive waste management services for the removal, transportation and disposal of chemical, radioactive and mixed wastes generated by the NIEHS, with dedicated vehicles, equipment, personnel, and management support.

The permit describes specific conditions, duties, and requirements with which the contract holder must comply. Additionally, a Material License has been issued to the NIEHS under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-438), and Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, Parts 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40 and 70. The license authorizes the NIEHS to receive, acquire, possess, and transfer certain byproducts, source and/or special nuclear material, and to use such materials for research and development, laboratory tracer studies, gas chromatography and instrument calibration, and irradiation of biological samples except those of explosive or hazardous material/waste and waste radioactive material contract holder must comply with.</p>

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).

The Bureau of Naval Personnel seeks to acquire management and technical support services to assist in performing strategic planning and business change management activities, business process re-engineering, functional data management, and business architecture documentation and analysis in support of the effort to modernize the Navys personnel and pay service delivery environment. The Navy is required to increase operational effectiveness and efficiency in the personnel and pay business area in order to provide services at less cost, and to meet audit requirements for the control of Government resources.
This acquisition will be issued utilizing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).
 

It is anticipated to solicit this requirement on a 100% full and open, competitive basis. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Contracts (MAC) program with CPFF and FFP ordering provisions is anticipated to result from this competitive RFP. The ordering period will cover one, three (3)-year base period with one, three (3)-year option period for a total of 72 months, if the option is exercised. FAR clause 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity permits task order completion no later than 364 days after expiration of the basic contract; therefore, the maximum performance period may be seven (7) years in length. The requirement will be processed as a Non-Commercial Services solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 15.
 The six year ordering period and seven year maximum performance period will accommodate fluctuations in the real-time emergence of requirements and the availability of funds throughout the duration of the contracts, and will accommodate differing performance periods among task orders. On- and Off-ramp provisions are anticipated.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this effort is 541990. The applicable Product Service Code (PSC) or Federal Supply Code (FSC) is R425. Offerors will be required to submit both non-price and price/cost proposals. The solicitation will consider the offerors non-price proposal more important than the offerors cost/price proposal.
 The estimated level of effort is 749,745 man-hours for the base period and a total of 749,745 man-hours if the option is exercised. Solicitation #N00189-13-R-Z001 will be made available electronically, upon its release, at www.neco.navy.mil. At this time the solicitation is expected to be released in the late February, early March 2013 timeframe.

<DESC>The fundamental mission of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is to provide Veterans, service members and their families the benefits they have earned through their military service to the United States.  VBA accomplishes its mission by delivering client-centered, personalized services that help Veterans readjust to civilian life and enhance their well-being. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has developed the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), a paperless claims processing system that will greatly decrease the time required to establish, develop, rate, and pay claims.  The VBMS document repository stores and manages Veterans' electronic folders (eFolders), which will replace the paper folders in use today.  Though efforts are underway to enable and encourage VBA's stakeholders to electronically submit claim-related source material, VBA currently maintains a large quantity of paper folders and will continue to receive physical documents, although at a reduced amount over time.  

To fill the VBMS document repository and eliminate the direct use of paper folders and physical documents in its claims process, VBA has embarked on one of the most ambitious and large-scale document conversion efforts ever undertaken by the US Government.  Primarily, this effort consists of imaging claims-related paper source materials into a Portable Document Format (PDF) file, capturing and associating limited metadata with the PDF file and uploading it into the VBMS repository.  In addition to imaging paper source material, VBA is also converting other source materials found in Veterans files, including microfilm, microfiche, and files stored on CDs, DVDs and flash memory devices.  

While document conversion is not an exceptionally complex process, the consequences for VBA of low quality images and inaccurate document identification are severe.  First and foremost, poorly converted source materials can lead VBA staff to make incorrect decisions regarding Veteran eligibility and entitlement for monetary and non-monetary benefits.  Making an incorrect decision for a Veteran can affect the remainder of his or her life.  Beyond this, VBA's paperless future requires that its VBMS document repository have sufficient quality to be an accepted standard of record for storage of Veteran information.  If this quality is not met, VBA's plans to use paperless processing to serve Veterans more efficiently would be severely hampered.  

The independent verification and validation (IV&V) contractor shall provide VBA with quality assurance (QA) surveillance services to provide confidence that the DCS vendors' QA and quality control (QC) processes and plans will result in deliverables (images and data) meeting VBA quality requirements.  

In addition to providing VBA with confidence that the DCS vendors are supplying VBA with quality images and data, the QA surveillance and QC reviews will provide VBA with data for internal and external reporting as well as documentation for system of records purposes.  
Veterans Affairs has awarded a contract to Axiom Corporation for IV&V for document conversion services.
