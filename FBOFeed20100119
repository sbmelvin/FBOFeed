<DESC>This is a notice of a proposed contract action published to notify potential sources that the USDA, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) contracting office intends to issue a sole source award to Iowa State University's Center for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH) for the purchase of services to develop and host an Internet Training Website for the National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP) to be used by the 71,000+ accredited veterinarians. In addition to developing and hosting the training they will administer the courses and track their completion.
<p>USDA, APHIS, VS Division acting in response to the publication of a Final Rule modifying the training, renewal, and suspension regulations within 9CFR Parts 160-162; a development, implementation and tracking system for the mandatory educational activity for renewal of veterinary accreditation must be created and operated. The time frame for the services to be provided begins the second semester of veterinary colleges' matriculation in 2010.</p>
<p>Since 2003 APHIS has provided cooperative agreements to the CFSPH to develop 21 modules for use in the National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP). Some of these modules are already approved for use in NVAP training. These training modules developed under a Cooperative Agreement, and which will be used for this contract, are the property of CFSPH. Since CFSPH is the sole owner of these modules they are the only contractor who has the legal right to host and publish these modules, which further supports CFSPH as the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>The USDA, APHIS intends to award a firm fixed price contract with an estimated value of $1,000,000.00. The contract will include a base year with the option to extend the contract for an additional four (4) years.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Therefore, this sole source award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other company will satisfy agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any inquires to this sole source acquisition must be submitted in writing to the attention of Corinne Nygren at USDA, APHIS Contracting, Butler Square, 5th Floor, 100 North Sixth Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, fax 612-336-3550 or by email to Corinne.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov.

ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components.
Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Oxford Instruments America, Inc, for the repair of Repair of NIST’s Oxford Teslatron Cryostat.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Quantum Electrical Metrology Division at NIST uses an Oxford Teslatron Cryostat for low-temperature quantum Hall measurements.  An assessment of the instrument’s magnet has found a resistive section at the point of the joint in the second section of windings in the Niobium Tin coil.  Oxford Instruments’ repaired the magnet.  During re-assembly, the inner helium dewar “can” failed, and therefore, requires additional repair for the replacement of the helium can.  Oxford Instruments is the original equipment manufacturer and has proprietary drawings of the cryostat.  Therefore, Oxford Instruments is the only known vendor capable of providing the repair services without incurring damages to the magnet.  Oxford Instrument, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the instrument that is required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $6,500,000.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 2, 2010, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6 – Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.  

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The proposed period of performance for this requirement is twelve months.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541990, with size standard of $7.0 Million.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the sole / single source reference, is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein. 

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Beckman Coulter Genomics, Inc. formerly (Agencourt Bioscience Corp.) 500 Cummings Center, Suite 2450, Beverly, MA 01915 to perform custom sequencing of patients’ DNA sample for mutations in the genes involved in the following rare diseases and disorders: alkaptonuria, ARPKD, ADPKD, Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome and albinism. In order to provide patients’ prognosis, anticipation for development of symptoms and possible treatment options it is important to identify the gene defect. The vendor will perform PCR amplification, sequencing, validation of results, and will make all data available through a secure website. The vendor will provide the following:

• Primer design and validation - will work with the NHGRI principal investigator to design and validate primer-sets for amplification and sequencing of specific genes if needed.
• Custom PCR and Sequencing - The NHGRI principal investigator will provide batches of patients DNA (between 6 and 70 genomic DNA samples at once). The vendor will perform PCR amplification, followed by DNA sequencing in a high-throughput sequencing system.
• Results - The sequencing results will be posted on the secure website for not more than 3 months, in that time the NHGRI researchers can transfer the results to their own files for analysis and storage.
• Data Analysis Support - The vendor will provide ad-hoc queries and access to the data set for all of the data retained in their central, data repository.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the vendor has optimized primer design and validation for each of the 5 diseases being studied and serviced this institute for the last 3 years. The current sequencing projects are part of ongoing studies under various current protocols. Result outputs to the lab are also now consistent due to a standard program set up for lab researchers to analyze results.  To make award to another vendor at this time would be inefficient. The government would incur additional cost through up-front set up costs.

Therefore, an award to any other source is not feasible or practical. The contract will be awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 - Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a response.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-068-TMB may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Tracy Brooks.

<CONTACT>Mario Henriquez 301-295-3049
<DESC>"THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY." THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CLARK/BALFOUR BEATTY (CBB) JOINT VENTURE AS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.
TITLE: RENOVATION OF OPERATING ROOMS AT NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MARYLAND. 
This proposed contract action based on other than full and open competition will be a firm-fixed price, sole source award to CBB for design build RFP development and Post Award Construction Services (PCAS).  It was requested that other than full and open competition be permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (2) as implemented by the FAR 6.302-1 - only one responsible source.
The CBB team is already responsible for repair, upgrade and reconfiguration of 17 existing Operating Rooms (OR) as well as the reconfiguration and renovation of adjacent supporting spaces and systems including mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure to create ORs that fully comply with DOD unified facilities criteria.  A separate project, BRAC design/build contract awarded to CBB, requires the addition of three (3) state-of-the-art ORs to the existing MC OR suite.  These three new ORs will enable the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) to perform specialized surgery now performed at the current Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).  These three new Ors under the BRAC program are required to facilitate the closing of WRAMC. Due to their long-term involvement with the project, CBB is well versed in the hospital's requirements, as they are nearly identical to those of the original.
The estimated release of the RFP is the 29th of January 2010.  The time frame for receipt of proposals will be provided in the solicitation notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).  Price will not be used as a criterion for selection.  There will be NO design services included in this contract.  Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest<BR>can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<BR><BR>b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders.

<DESC>Solicitation W912EK-10-T-0022 for one complete set of hydro turnine bearings will soon follow.<BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:<BR><BR>The contractor is to provide one complete set of Lignum Vitae hydro-turbine bearings for Lock and Dam 15. Four staves and four base plates are required per bearing, for a total of four complete bearings.<BR><BR>Quotes containing any other material than the Lignum Vitae specified herein for the bearing should refer to clause 52.211-6.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>Lock and Dam 15 has had continual issues with the Thordon hydro turbine bearings made of composite metal.  The life of the first composite metal bearing lasted 6 years and the second composite metal bearing lasted less than 2 years.  The original hydro turbine bearings made of Lignum Vitae, a rare wood, lasted from 1934 to 2001.  The Lignum Vitae bearing design kept the hydro turbine in service for sixty-seven years.  Modern composite metal bearing materials such as Thoradon, Ryetex, Mycarta, and Phenolics are unacceptable materials due to their inability to match the characteristics of Lignum Vitae.  <BR><BR>Lignum Vitae is a rare and endangered natural resource that needs to be machined to fit the existing shaft of the hydro turbine.  Not only does the Lignum Vitae provide the strength needed to keep the shaft in place, but it also lubricates the shaft and aids in filtering the raw water of the Mississippi River.  Lignum Vitae is the heartwood of the genus Guaiacum; the scientific name is Guaiacum Officinale, G. sanctum.  Two aspects have made Lignum Vitae a key resource in hydro-turbine bearings: hardness and self-lubrication.  <BR><BR>SPECIFICATIONS FOR LIGNUM VITAE BEARINGS:<BR><BR>MATERIAL:  The material of the bearing shall be made of Lignum Vitae with a stainless steel backing plate.  The Lignum Vitae and stainless steel base plate shall be fastened together making one piece.  The lignum vitae minimum thickness shall be 2.48 and the backing plate shall be  stainless steel.<BR><BR>The salient characteristics of Lignum-Vitae are as follows:  <BR><BR>Category                                    Units<BR>Dry Weight			            77 lb/cu ft<BR>Density (air dry)		      	    77-82 lb/cu ft<BR>Specific Gravity		            1.37<BR>Hardness			       	    4,500 lb<BR>Max.

Engineering experience is critical to machine the bearing to fit the shaft since it is not perfectly cylindrical.<BR><BR>LEGAL DOCUMENTATION: The Contractor shall demonstrate that the Lignum Vitae has been imported to the U.S. in compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). <BR><BR>DETAILED DRAWINGS: Detailed drawings must be provided with the submittal of the bid.  The drawings must be adjusted from the ATTACHED metal Thordon bearings to Lignum Vitae, using industry standards for wood hydro bearings.<BR><BR>GUIDANCE: The electrician at Lock and Dam 15 can help aid in the production of the drawings due to hands on experience with the hydro-turbine.  However, if questions cannot be answered in a suitable manner, it is the contractors responsibility to arrange a site visit with the lockmaster.<BR><BR>DELIVERY: All quotes must include delivery to Lock and Dam 15 along with installation guidelines specified by industry standards for wood hydro bearings.<BR><BR>Locations of POC and Delivery: <BR>	<BR>Steve Felderman, Lockmaster<BR>Art Purdy, Electrician<BR>Lock and Dam 15<BR>Building 328<BR>Rock Island, IL 612404-2004<BR>309-794-5266<BR><BR>Technical questions shall be referred to:<BR><BR>CJ Brooks <BR>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <BR>Mississippi River Project Office<BR>25549 182nd<BR>Pleasant Valley, IA 52767<BR>309-794-4545<BR>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Reproductive Health (DRH), Women's Health and Fertility Branch, (WHFB), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is requesting information to determine the availability of qualified contractors to collect, manage, monitor, and perform some analyses while ensuring the timeliness and quality of the data reported by U.S. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) programs (e.g., clinics) to the CDC. As mandated by the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (FCSRCA), P.L. 102-493, U.S. ART programs must report all ART cycles, even those discontinued before all steps were undertaken, along with outcomes to the CDC annually. The FCSRCA also mandates that CDC publish an annual report of ART pregnancy success rates along with the embryo laboratory certification status of each program. Programs that do not report are not in compliance with the FCSRCA and are listed in the annual report as non-reporters.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>In 2002, two million women of reproductive age were infertile. There were 142,435 ART cycles reported and 43,412 live-birth deliveries resulting from ART procedures performed in the U.S. and its territories in 2007. <br />CDC's primary objectives in developing the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) are (1) to publish the mandated annual surveillance report for Congress; (2) to provide ART consumers with an accurate and standardized resource for high-quality information about ART procedures and outcomes; and (3) to conduct studies on other questions regarding ART, including safety and efficacy, birth weight, and preterm delivery<br />Project requirements<br />The contractor shall use the NASS. The contractor shall collect, manage, and maintain ART data; develop and implement appropriate data validation strategies; perform some statistical analyses; assess and implement procedures to ensure data quality; and generate required datasets (multiple formats). Activities also include developing technical documentation, training materials, modifying the data collection system, developing and maintaining an electronic tracking system on ART programs, and providing training and technical support to the CDC and ART programs. The contractor shall collaborate with CDC partner organizations; facilitate, document, and participate in meetings; coordinate and conduct site visits; draft reports; and attend conferences as directed. The contractor must address all NASS requirements along with supporting and maintaining the import of data from other electronic data collection systems. The contractor shall ensure and maintain data security and assist with the preparation of materials needed to gain human subjects protections, information systems security, and Office of Management and Budget approvals.</p>
<p>The Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, shall furnish all personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies, materials and any subcontract agreements and procedures necessary to assist CDC in meeting the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (FCSRCA), P.L. 102-493.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance<br /></strong>The intent is to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for six (6) phases. The period of performance will be from the date of award through 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement information sought<br /></strong>Interested businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit an electronic copy of their capability statement, addressing the information regarding respondents': (a) Corporate experience and management capability including key staff expertise, including their availability, and experience; (b) Current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; and (c) Examples of current and completed relevant projects.

<DESC>Notice of US Government Interest to Renew Lease

The United States Government currently occupies approximately 4000 contiguous net usable square feet (4200 rentable square feet) of office and related space in a building under lease in Garden County, Nebraska.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location.  The space must be available for occupancy on or before April 1, 2010.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  

North- Rd 68/Trail Rd
East- Rd 68, Rd 183, Rd 69, and Rd 181
South- Rd 18, Hwy 92/26, and Rd 171 
West- Rd 171

Other applicable requirements include:	
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
-	Parking – 20 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessor’s control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service (FS) Smokejumper Program is requesting information on currently available parachute systems that meet all or some of the requirements outlined below.  The FS Smokejumper Program is also requesting information on current or proposed development efforts that could develop a system that would meet all of the requirements.  The intent of this request is to determine the current and near future state of the art of Ram-Air and non-Ram-Air parachute systems that will enhance Smokejumper performance and safety.  
U.S. Forest Service Smokejumper Program requirements for a new parachute system:

System Performance Requirements:
1. Parachute system must have the capability to perform at a reliability and confidence level of not less than .995 at the 90% confidence level throughout FS testing. (Using binomial distribution chart) 
2. Must operate at 15,000 ft MSL and below.
3. Must allow for an exit weight range from 190 pounds to 325 pounds with an objective of 400 pounds.  
4. If a static line is used to deploy the main parachute it must use the U.S. military 15 ft universal static line and snap hook.
5. If it is a ram air system it must incorporate an AAD that is capable of being turned on at altitude and/or set for a specific pressure altitude.  
6. System must be compatible with high and low tail aircraft when being used in side door exits.

Main Parachute Requirements:
1. Main Parachute must have toggles that allow for turning the parachute left, right and applying brakes.
2. Descent rate at landing must be less than 14fps with an objective of less than 10fps.  At opening altitudes the canopy must be able to produce higher rates of descent to allow for jumper separation.
3. Forward speed shall be at least 12 mph with an objective forward speed of 15 mph or higher in zero wind conditions.  Forward speed upon landing will be controllable to less than 8 mph in order to reduce landing force while still meeting the descent rate requirement.
4. Canopy must be able to perform steep glide angle descent approaches (1:2 to 1:4 or 60-75 degrees in no wind) into timbered, steep mountainous terrain and remain stable through landing while meeting the above descent rate and forward speed landing requirement.
5. Braking capability will be enough to stop forward flight of canopy in zero wind conditions.  Reverse flight is not required.
6. Canopy must be able to perform above criteria for the entire range of exit weights.
7. Normal opening shock G forces will be 8 G’s or less from a side door exit at 110 knot equivalent airspeed (KEAS).
8. Canopy must be able to withstand opening shock at max weight, 15,000 ft MSL and 130 KEAS without any damage to the canopy or subassemblies.
	
Reserve Parachute Requirements:
1. Reserve parachute must be maneuverable.
2. Reserve canopy must meet TSO C-23d specifications or later revisions.
3. Reserve may be smaller than main canopy, but must have similar flight characteristics.  The reserve must be compatible with minimum and maximum exit weights, speed and altitude as mentioned above.
4. If the main canopy has a cutaway system then a reserve static line must be incorporated.
5. Reserve will demonstrate reliability in high speed and low speed malfunctions. 

Harness Container Requirements:
1. The Harness container assembly must fit Smokejumpers in a range from 60” tall 120 pounds to 77” tall 225 pounds.
2. Maximum weight of the system must not exceed 50 pounds with an objective of weighing less than 40 pounds. 
3. Optimally the system would be modular, meaning the main container and the reserve container are independent of one another, and both are independent of the harness.   
4. System may be a piggy back configuration or the main parachute can be of a back type and reserve parachute can be of a chest type.  Harness will have a quick attachment point for a personal gear bag that may range in weight from 5 to 30 pounds and lands with the jumper (no lowering line will be used).

Deployment Requirements:
1. Must be deployable with side door and rear ramp exits from aircraft at 90 -130 KEAS with an exit altitude of up to 15,000 ft MSL.
2. May be deployed by static line or static line drogue with drogue release.

 Construction Materials and Hardware:
1. All materials and hardware will be of PIA or MIL specifications

Operational and Logistical Requirements:
1. Must be capable of use in temperature range of -15 to 150 degrees F.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS CONTEMPLATED PROCUREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO UTILIZE THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009 FUNDING IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCES CAN SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT.

All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks an atomic resolution scanning electron beam dimensional research microscope and metrology platform.

Responses from responsible sources should clearly establish capability of providing Atom-Metrology Scanning Electron Research Microscopes and Metrology Platform.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for this instrument, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

Requirements for the Atom-Metrology Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) are as follows:

The Atom-Metrology Scanning Electron Research Microscope and Metrology Platform is a unique reference measurement instrument sub-nanometer best resolution.  This instrument incorporates advanced laser interferometry in the specimen stage to accurately track the X and Y and preferably other motions of the stage.  This instrument will be used for the development and calibration of accurate length metrology reference artifacts and to provide dimensional metrology solutions on samples that can be measured by an electron beam as the probe.  Additionally, dual-beam capability is desired for sample preparation, modification and characterization through slicing, and for sample fabrication down to the nanometer scale.

SEMs are widely used in U.S. research, development and manufacturing, especially in the fields of nanotechnology and microelectronics where individual device sizes are now approaching few nanometers, but overall sample size can be 100 mm or greater.  A modern scanning electron beam research and metrology platform is needed in order to satisfy the NIST customers' needs for length standards on large substrates (silicon wafers and photomasks) and to achieve breakthroughs in accurate metrology using scanned electron beam instrumentation. 

This instrument will enable improvements in the development of measurement tools and techniques for qualitative and quantitative atomic to macro scale structural characterization of materials, samples, devices and reference structures and fabrication of structures down to a few nanometer in size.  Although NIST currently has the capability to perform high-resolution characterization of metal particles and semiconductor structures, it lacks the ability to perform high-accuracy three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale characterization of these structures and samples at and below 10 nm.  For these applications ultra high resolution, i.e. better than 1 nanometer imaging capability at low landing energy (< 1 keV) electron beam, is indispensable.  An ultra-high resolution SEM will permit the imaging and size and shape determination of highly sensitive nanometer-size samples such as gold and other nanoparticles and various other nanostructures.  Sample contamination and sample damage must be kept at negligible levels, while relevant surface information with excellent signal-to-noise ratio and contrast are required.  It is desired to have a combined functionallity of a dual-beam instrument, which combines the capabilities of a SEM and a highly focused ion beam column.  These together can allow for sample preparation, sample characterization through slicing, sample fabrication down to the nanometer scale.  Key part of the requirements is a fast and sub-200 picometer resolution laser interferometer sample stage that allows for stage drift and vibration compensation and provide traceability at least in the X and Y direction measurements.  It is desired that this sample stage will have X, Y and Z laser position measurement capability and other sample stage motions (tilt, rotation) will have position measurement by high-precision scales.

Requested Information to be Included in Responses to this Notice:

1.  Indicate whether your company manufactures or is an authorized reseller/business partner for an Atom-Metrology SEM of any kind and, if so, please provide complete commercial specifications for the Atom-Metrology SEM that your company manufactures or sells, including the name of the company that manufactures the Atom-Metrology SEM, where it is manufactured, and detailed functional and performance specifications that the product meets.
2.  If your organization is an original equipment manufacturer of Atom-Metrology SEM, then please provide the name of company(ies) that are authorized by your organization, as the OEM, to sell your organization's Atom-Metrology SEM, as well as their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).
3.  Indicate the number of days, after acceptance of order, which is typical for delivery of Atom-Metrology SEM to the intended delivery location.
4.  A complete copy of standard terms and conditions for the Atom-Metrology SEM that your organization manufactures or sells, to include, at a minimum: base warranty, available extended warranty (if offered), copy of software license(s) (if applicable), and customary payment terms.
5.  Available training that can be purchased or may be included with the purchase of the Atom-Metrology SEM.
6.  Customary documentation that is provided with the purchase of the Atom-Metrology SEM.
7.  Describe optional items that are available for purchase for the Atom-Metrology SEM, such as consumables, spares, tools, additional components, ancillary equipment, software licenses, telephone support, etc. 
8.  If any of the above-referenced NIST Atom-Metrology SEM specifications appear to be unduly restrictive, then please indicate which specification you believe is unduly restrictive and indicate how you believe it could be more competitively worded such that it can be met by more than one Atom-Metrology SEM manufacturer and still meet the definition of commercial item at FAR 2.101.
9.  Indicate whether modifications of the Atom-Metrology SEM currently manufactured or sold by your organization would be necessary to meet Government specifications listed in this notice and, if so, indicate whether those modifications would be considered minor modifications as described in the FAR Subpart 2.101 definition of commercial item.
10.  The number of persons currently employed by your company, including parent organization and all subsidiaries (if applicable).
11.  Indicate whether the Atom-Metrology SEM referenced in the response is currently available for ordering from one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts and, if so, provide the GSA FSS contract number(s).
12.  Provide any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

Responses to this notice shall be sent by email to Kim Stavish, Contract Specialist, at kim.stavish@nist.gov, with cc: to Todd Hill at todd.hill@nist.gov, so that it is received at that email address no later than January 29, 2010. The responses should include responses to all 12 requests for information listed above.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is 500 employees. 

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to develop multiplexed screening assays that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment for newborn screening. The end result may integrate a platform of screening technologies or even a single analytic technique that State Newborn Screening Programs or large commercial laboratories involved in newborn screening can adopt.  The Screening technology platform of components may be based on a range of technologies that include, but are not limited to, microchip technologies, microbead technologies, nanotechnologies, microfluidics, DNA assays, biophysical assays, and/or technologies based on RNA or protein analysis. Offerors should propose a technology that tests for several conditions or an integrated platform of complementary technologies that can accomplish the screening of groups of conditions. These conditions might include inborn errors of metabolism, hematological disorders, congenital endocrinopathies, lysosomal storage diseases, chromosomal disorders (e.g., trisomies, monosomies), Fragile X syndrome, or those disorders characterized through control mechanisms of gene expression (e.g., epigenetics).  NICHD prefers that the technology platforms integrate the testing of multiple groups of conditions and link to newborn screening informatic systems and encourages comparative effectiveness testing of different assays or technologies. NICHD is particularly interested in technologies that screen for "high priority" conditions with current or promising effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, severe combined immunodeficiency, lysosomal storage diseases such as Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, and the mucopolysaccharidoses), which presently lack sensitive and specific tests.  A report, "Newborn Screening: Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System" (httm://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening), which the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration sponsored and the American College of Medical Genetics developed, identifies some of these "high priority" conditions. In this solicitation, a "high priority" condition is a condition for which the development of a screening test would make the condition amenable to newborn screening.  

Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: 

1.	The ability to develop multiplexed screening assays that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment for newborn screening.

2.	The ability to integrate a platform of screening technologies or even a single analytic technique which could be adopted by State Newborn Screening Programs or large commercial laboratories involved in newborn screening. 

3.	Experience in utilizing and developing a wide range of screening technologies including but not limited to the following: microchip technologies, microbead technologies, nanotechnologies, microfluidics, DNA assays, biophysical assays, and/or technologies based on RNA or protein analysis.

4.	The ability to develop and utilize new technologies that screen for "high priority" conditions with current or promising effective therapeutic interventions or conditions that may in the future benefit from newborn screening.  

5.	The ability to develop bioinformatics for data collection and analysis. 

6.	The ability to conduct comparative effectiveness testing of different assays or technologies.

Interested organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this project should submit electronic copies in addition to four (4) hard copies of their capability statement, addressing the areas above. Please limit responses to fifteen (15) pages or less. Any proprietary information should be so marked. Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by no later than 4:30PM local time on January 29, 2010. Capability statements must identify the business status of the organization (i.e. educational institution, non-profit, large business, small business, 8 (a), or other corporate or non-corporate entity). NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO THE 4 HARD COPIES.

Responses should be no more than 15 pages. These pages exclude resumes.

<DESC>: The, Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, FL., intends to award a purchase order to Teledyne RD InstrumentsWH300-600 LADCP profiler. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory, Miami, FL on its hydropraphic cruises uses two Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (LADCP) mounted on a rosette with a CTD. These LADCP's used in a dual configuration mode, measure vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity components from near the ocean surface to near the bottom. The observations provide absolute velocity estimates including the ageostrophic component of the flow. Teledyne RD Instruments (RDI) is the only known manufacture of the LADCP unit. This unit is a broadband, self- contained 300 kHz instrument.<br />This instrument will routinely be pressure cycled to 6000m depths and must be designed to work under these conditions without adversely affecting data collection. Teledyne RD Instruments (RDI) is the only know provided of LADCP equipment that can be integrated into a dual LADCP configuration utilized by NOAA/AOML/PHOD during full-ocean depth profiling (two units together in tandem, collecting data set). RDI hold the patent on the broadband signal processing technology which enables their LADCP instruments to perform. The RDI ADCP also uses four acoustic transducers. The fourth transducer provide a means for quality control of the collected data. Any instruments purchased must be able to run RDI 52xx firmware and output in a forat that is compatible with custom processing software used at AOML(identical to the RDI format).<br />To be considered interested parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to provide the LADCP. Firms must furnish detailed specifications and descriptions to demonstrate their capability to provide the product and satisfy the Government's needs. Capability information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone numbers and address of concerns for which you have previously furnished this supply, and detailed narrative that describes the instrument and your ability to provide this supply as specified. Interested parties must respond within (7) seven days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to the only known source, Teledyne RD Instruments (RDI).
<p>The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The NAICS code is 334511. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source. However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Teledyne RD Instruments (RDI), whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Requirement

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Pittsboro, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 600 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a maximum of 660 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for a base period of five (5) years with one (1) five-year option period.  The space must be available for occupancy by 09/01/2010.  The delineated area is the entire city limits of Pittsboro, including:

NORTH: From the intersection of Rectory St. and Thompson St. on a line east to S. Small St.

EAST:  On a line south from the intersection on Thompson St. and S. Small St. to the intersection with Chatham St.

SOUTH:  On a line west from the intersection of S. Small St. and Chatham St. to the intersection with Rectory St.

WEST: On a line north from the intersection of Chatham St. and Rectory St. to Thompson St.

Other applicable requirements include:
• Parking for 3 Government vehicles, 3 employee vehicles, and 5 client parking spaces (total of 11 parking spaces).

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency down-time.

<ARCHDATE>02262010
<CONTACT>David Nemerow 202-781-3314
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command is seeking Small Business sources for the competitive selection of a producer of the Signal Data Processor assembly of the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare (AAW) capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units.  CEC fuses the distributed data into a fire control quality, single, air track picture that significantly improves own unit track precision, consistency and continuity; expands detection ranges; and increases reaction time.  CEC also improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies.  The processor set for CEC has recently been re-designed to achieve Crypto Modernization requirements and provide one box for all platforms, while maintaining CEC Baseline 2.1 functionality.  The initial award would be in FY 2011 with priced options through FY 2014.  Installation and Checkout (INCO) Kits and initial spares will also be solicited and will be full signal data processor units as the full unit is the lowest repairable unit (LRU) (i.e., box level sparing).  First delivery is scheduled to begin 12 months after contract award.  The signal data processor assembly will be provided as Government Furnished Property to the CEC system manufacturer and design agent, Raytheon Network Centric Systems of St. Petersburg, Florida for systems integration, system test and delivery. A firm fixed price contract with quantity based pricing will be solicited.  This assembly is the heart of the CEC system and provides the processing capability for sensor track fusion.  A competitive solicitation is expected to be issued approximately AUG 2010.  The requirement will be based on a design specification that was manufactured and tested in FY 2010.  The signal data processor meets sea, air and land-mobile requirements.  The source selection will be based on a best value determination by the Navy Program Manager.  If your firm is interested in this procurement, please send an expression of interest by 11 FEB 2010 to the Contracting Officer at Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Mr. David (SEA 02521), 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040 at e-mail address: David.Nemerow@navy.mil .  This expression of interest should contain a single point-of-contact and include mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address for said point-of-contact.  Only one point-of-contact per company is requested.  Offers from foreign companies will not be considered.  Offeror must have SECRET stowage and facility clearances in order to receive the data package that will be available at the time of solicitation.

This notice is open to qualified business sources of all sizes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541711.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method for the advanced development of Medical Countermeasures (MCMs).<BR><BR><BR>BACKGROUND AND MISSION:<BR><BR>Synopsis:  The Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical Biological Defense is seeking medical countermeasures for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and therapy of cases due to intracellular bacterial pathogens in support of the Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI) program.  The TMTI mission is to protect the Warfighter from naturally emerging or genetically engineered biological threats by providing a capability that includes rapid response (platform capability) and the development of broad spectrum Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medical countermeasures.  High priority organisms include hemorrhagic fever viruses and intracellular bacteria on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category A and B high priority pathogen list.<BR><BR><BR>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>Specifically, the program is interested the development of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (excluding vaccines) and therapeutics for illnesses due to intracellular bacterial pathogens.  This request prioritizes the inhalational route of bacterial challenge, but the candidate medical countermeasures may be administered by oral, transdermal, inhalational, or other parenteral routes.  Etiologic agents within the biodefense domain may include, but are not limited to Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia spp., Francisella tularensis, Brucella spp., and Bacillus anthracis.  TMTI prioritizes candidates that have a broad anti-bacterial spectrum of activity (see definitions below).  The intended use may be administration as a standalone or adjunctive therapy.   Solutions from domains outside of biodefense related-research (e.g. HIV, cancer, sepsis, and trauma) with the potential for efficacy against the above etiologic agents are encouraged.  Approaches may include new discoveries or repurposing of FDA approved treatments or candidates in late development.  If the drug or biologic can be used as pre-exposure, post-exposure prophylaxis in addition to treatment, it would be of higher interest<BR>Definitions: <BR><BR>	1.  Broad Spectrum Antibiotics  The term broad spectrum in this context has a <BR>threshold and an objective:<BR>	<BR>Threshold:	activity against two or more bacterial genera<BR>Objective:	activity against at least two of the following threats<BR><BR>"	Yersinia pestis, <BR>"	Burkholderia mallet, <BR>"	Francisella tularensis, <BR>"	Burkholderia pseudomallei, <BR>"	Brucella spp., and <BR>"	Bacillus anthracis<BR><BR>	2.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI)/ Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the United States Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD). The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The ABNSOTD welcomes Corporate Capability Statements and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimates from all individuals and organizations. ATEC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or ABNSOTDs use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of ABNSOTDs evaluation of the information received. As a result of this Notice, the ATEC may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). Should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  Industry should be advised that a previous Request for Proposal (W9115U-09-R-0001) was issued and offers were received however the offers were determined above fair market price.  As a result the solicitation was cancelled and no award was made.<BR><BR>Scope:<BR><BR>The purpose of this notice is to seek possible vendors capable of enhancing the design, development, and production for the Geometric Automated Video Enhanced Location System (GAVELS), a one-of-a-kind Government system.   The GAVELS system was originally developed in 1998 by Integrated Sensors Incorporated (ISI) of Utica, NY, which is no longer in business.<BR><BR>GAVELS is used to locate exploding artillery rounds and to track parachute<BR>airdrop items, including personnel and cargo, using the Universal Transverse<BR>Mercator (UTM) coordinates and altitude. The system has one major subsystem that records events or targets using digital video and records vital information such as GPS time, event number, and other information the user desires to include on each frame. The event must be recorded with multiple video cameras in order to calculate position using triangulation techniques.  A second analysis subsystem uses the information from the camera sites and associates them with the GPS time as the common attribute.<BR><BR>The existing GAVELS employs Government owned software which must be modified, updated or replaced as necessary to accommodate new cameras, facilitate improved accuracy and improve usability.  Factors to consider in terms of improving usability must include all processes involved in setting up for test, collecting data and data reduction.  The contractor must also integrate new hardware and software into a complete, functional system. The intention of the enhancement is to make the system more accurate, easier to use and add the capability to use it during night tests.<BR><BR>The system enhancement will be conducted in a phased approach.  Phase 1A will be a design phase to include the development of a comprehensive system Enhancement Plan.  In Phase 1A, the primary tasks are to analyze the current GAVELS system capabilities and weigh those capabilities against the requirements; develop an Enhancement Plan; and design, build and demonstrate a prototype as a proof-of-concept.  Phase 1B will include producing and testing the system designed in Phase 1A.   The comprehensive Enhancement Plan will also include planning for follow-on phases to include planning for sustainment.  Due to this phased approach, it is crucial that the system be designed in an open and upgradeable architecture to facilitate the planned improvements.<BR><BR>Additional information about the GAVELS system is posted to the AMSCA website: https://www.amsca.atec.army.mil.  Interested offerors may also request CDs containing Technical Data, Manuals and Drawing via the AMSCA email address:  amsca.atec@us.army.mil.  <BR><BR>Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest to perform the key requirements described above, delivery lead time, warranty information, a ROM estimate and any other market information deemed necessary.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. <BR><BR> All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response.  Interested offerors shall respond to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days from date of posting.  Per FAR 15.201 (c) Interested offerors may provide feedback on acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type deemed most appropriate for this requirement, manufacturing lead time.  E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice and should be submitted to amsca.atec@us.army.mil .<BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>ATEC Mission Support Contracting Activity<BR>Fort Hood, Texas  76542 <BR>Place of Performance: <BR>Fort Bragg, North Carolina <BR>United States <BR>Primary Point of Contact: <BR>Angelic Hatcher,<BR>Contract Specialist<BR>angelic.hatcher@us.army.mil <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

Title of Project:  Department of Veterans Affairs Clinical IP Video to Home Pilot2.   Scope: The hardware, software and services contracted for, through this statement of work, will enable a pilot of fully encrypted broadband clinical IP video for real-time clinical video telehealth between VA sites and up to fifty (50) non-VA private residences.3.  Background:  The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has over 7.8 million enrolled veterans (with about 5.6 million active users).  VA recognizes the need to increase access to its health care services for all veterans, especially veterans in rural areas or veterans with clinical conditions making travel to VA sites for care extremely difficult, such as Spinal Cord, Traumatic Brain Injury, Multiple Sclerosis, etc.  Fully encrypted broadband clinical IP video conferencing enables real-time/interactive VA clinical consultation and services between VA providers and Veteran patients in non-VA private residences.VA currently provides care to 40,000 Veteran patients in their homes and local communities using home telehealth technologies. One of the technologies in routine usage is real-time video conferencing into the home. Care has been provided in this manner for over 10 years by VA using clinical video conferencing and video phones that use plain old telephone lines (POTS) connectivity to transfer video.Clinical video conferencing to the home replicates a face-to-face visit and thereby enhances access to care and reduces the cost and inconvenience of travel to Veteran patients. Hitherto the use of POTS video has been unsatisfactory because of:"	the cost of supplying the home telehealth technology to Veteran patients and "	the problems associated with (non-broadband) POTS connectivity for video, combined with"	the reduced use of land lines by the Veteran patient population. Particular areas of clinical need that have been identified for IP video into the home are:"	Telemental Health Care"	Spinal Cord Injury CareVA has established a Clinical Enterprise Video Conferencing Network (CEVN). This national platform supports the use of medical care technologies to perform clinical video conferencing on the VA's dedicated intranet. VA has just completed a "video expressway" that provides access, through the VA firewall, to clinical video conferencing with non-VA sites -  and this opens up the capability of VA to undertake clinical video conferencing into the home via internet protocol (IP) using broadband connectivity, instead of POTS, to transfer video.A new video conferencing software application is now commercially available (MOVI) that will enable secure encrypted video between patients' homes and VA clinicians via the VA's video expressway. This technology enables the Veteran patient's own personal computer or laptop with a webcam to provide the video connection to VA clinicians. A VA clinician sends an e-mail with the IP address for the time-limited window in which a consultation can take place.The intent of this pilot is to define the model for a permanent solution that will provide this routine service. 4.  Type of Contract/Order Considered: Firm Fixed Price.5.  Proposed period of performance:  The base period of performance will be one year from date of award plus for additional option years.GENERAL REQUIREMENTS IP Videoconferencing Hardware and Management & Installation Software plus Warranty Agreement and Annual Remote Maintenance Service1.	Clinical Specifications for IP Videoconferencing Hardware and Management & Installation Software for IP Videoconferencing pilot2.	Technical Specifications and Deliverables required for IP Clinical Video Pilot.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to extend the contract period of the current contract until December 31, 2010 with Capital Consulting Corporation (CCC), a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business located at 2819 Old Lee Highway Fairfax, VA 22031.  The purpose of this contract extension is to provide logistical support for the AHRQ Annual meeting in September 2010.  CCC is a service-disabled veteran firm that demonstrated complete success in planning the AHRQ 2009 annual meeting. CCC provided critical on site support to AHRQ staff where they learned the intricate knowledge of how AHRQ is structured and how work is performed at AHRQ.  The knowledge gained relating to mission and goals is critical to content formation in developing sessions for the upcoming annual meeting. CCC staff performed critical problem solving skills in helping AHRQ identify electronic solutions for registration, abstract collection and tracking of invitees and attendees. CCC developed a unique set of registration and tracking tools which AHRQ wants to see enhanced this year.   CCC gained critical understanding of important timelines, as well as circumstances that may affect our ability to meet strategic goals and objectives. AHRQ Senior Management desires to continue working with CCC this year to further improve the yearly conference.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide the public the announcement of NASAGoddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC's)intent to negotiate with Northrup GrummanInformation Technologies (NG), Herndon, VA an effort to test software to meet the needsof our particular use implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under existing indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity Task Order NNG06HN01D, NG willprovide all necessary support services to perform an analysis entitled, "AcceleratorTechnologies and Earth System Models". The goal of this Order is to have NG evaluate thesuitability of the current generation of hardware "accelerators" (e.g. commercialproducts such as the NVIDIA Tesla series of graphical processing units (GPU's)).  Thisclass of commercially available processors can potentially improve performance of keyaspects of NASA's weather and climate models.  The Contractor's evaluation shouldprimarily analyze the potential performance benefits against the labor costs for adaptingNASA's software to exploit this technology.   In addition to the software costs, theContractor will analyze costs associated with integrating accelerators within a computingenvironment including power and cooling considerations. The computational kernels ofNASA's weather/climate models to be considered within this task are: 1)Solar radiation(SORAD) component from the GEOS-5 model; 2) Cubed-sphere Finite Volume Dynamical Core(CSFVCore); and 3) Sparse Matrix Vector Gear Code (SMVGEAR) from the Global ModelingInitiative (GMI) model.For each of these kernels, NG shall perform an initial evaluation to determine the beststrategy for studying the potential performance impact of accelerator technology.  When afull port for a given kernel is not feasible, NG shall provide a written explanation ofboth the nature of the difficulty and a rationale for a proposed alternativeimplementation where appropriate.   This explanation shall also estimate the possibleerror in the performance estimation due to such simplifications.  NG shall commit thefinal implementation prototypes to the sourcemotel.gsfc.nasa.gov repository.   NG shall deliver a draft and final version of a comprehensive report which summarizes thepotential performance impact of accelerator technologies for NASA Earth system modeling.  This document must address the degree to which the selected kernels are representativeof the computational work on NASA's high-end computers. The document must also estimatethe conversion/maintenance costs associated with migrating full models to exploitaccelerator technologies.  The report must estimate the potential for future support forcompiler and/or Fortran support (e.g. Portland Group GPU Fortran directives) for usingthis technology within scientific models.  GSFC will make the final report available tothe public.The following lists the deliverables under this Sub-Task Order: 1)Weekly: oralstatus reports to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR); 2) Start + 4weeks: Written evaluation strategy for all 3 computational kernels delivered to COTR andContracting Officer (CO); 3) Start + 20 weeks:	Prototype implementation of all 3computational kernels delivered to COTR; 4)Start + 22 weeks: Draft version of acomprehensive report described above delivered to the COTR.  GSFC will return it'spreliminary 2 business weeks from receipt for further processing to NG; and 5) Start + 24weeks:	Final version of a comprehensive report described above delivered to the COTR andthe CO.The existing Task Order is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee arrangement awarded to NG 10/2005 whichwas awarded on a competitive basis.  NG is not listed on the Excluded Parties List Systemand therefore eligible to receive Recovery Act funds.

The remainder of the DRFP, Section J documents, will be made available on CDs via the GMD technical data/ bidders’ library.  These CDs are expected to be available no later than January 25, 2010.  To receive the Section J documents/CDs, you must send email request to the Mr. Cole at timothy.cole@mda.mil.  While the Section J documentation/CDs will only be provided as requested, all current authorized recipients will automatically receive the next technical data library release, which is expected to occur no later than the end of January 2010.  Throughout the pre-solicitation phase, the Government plans to add, as becomes available, technical data and other information to the bidders’ library.  

The bidders’ library contains classified and export-controlled data, therefore, access will be restricted to personnel who have been cleared by MDA contracting and security officials.  Please note that those that have not been previously cleared for the GMD bidders’ library must be cleared prior to issuance of the Section J documentation. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign a GMD Bidders’ Library Access Agreement.  This form may be obtained by contacting Mr. Cole at timothy.cole@mda.mil.  

MDA intends to provide a DSC Transition Focus Day event in Huntsville, AL (MDA Bradford Facility) on February 5, 2010, from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM.  Presentations will include an overview of the GMD Element, as well as information on projected DSC work scope; transition from current GMD contracts to new contract; resources, facilities, GFX, etc.  This event will be the first planned 2010 industry day and will begin dialogue with industry with the intent to enhance Government solicitation documents and contractor proposal preparations/submittals.  Interested contractors should provide an email, titled “DSC Contract Transition Focus Day Attendees”, to Mr. Tim Cole at GMDD&SCompetition@mda.mil, not later than January 26, 2010.  Attendance is currently limited to three (3) individuals per contractor, therefore, the email should include the names, positions, and other pertinent data for the planned attendees and, if applicable, any alternates.  Additional instructions, registration requirements (e.g., visit authorization requests), and site location directions will be provided via the GMD DSC Acquisition Website and/or directly to attendees based on contact information provided to Mr. Cole.
 
The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors, i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams. Further, the government does not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts in support of the GMD Joint Program Office. 

Release of this DRFP is NOT a commitment by the Government to award a contract and the Government will NOT pay any costs incurred as a result of this release. Written comments/questions on the DRFP are due to this office February 9, 2010.  Questions/Comments should be emailed and titled “DSC Comments/Questions”, to Mr. Tim Cole at GMDD&SCompetition@mda.mil.

Please be advised that all communications concerning this acquisition (including, but not limited to, management/technical issues, pricing issues, administration issues, and proposal issues) must be coordinated through the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Michele Williams at michele.williams@mda.mil or the Contract Specialist, Mr. Tim Cole at timothy.cole@mda.mil.

<DESC>Sole Source Notice of Intent – Spectrum Detectors Inc.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Analytical Chemical Division, intends to negotiate with Spectrum Detectors Inc. , on a sole source basis under the authority of  FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, for the purchase of  Model SDX-1094-Dome, Temperature controlled  pyroelectric trap detector and electronics (1 each), Model SDX-1095-Wedge, Pyroelectric trap detector redesign and rework of SDX-1006 (2 each), Model SDX-1096, Precision current-to-voltage converter with Rogers 4003C board without solder mask (1 each), Model SDX-1100 Luminance adapter tubes (3 each). : NIST has purchased pyroelectric hybrid and wedge detectors from Spectrum Detector Inc.  Now, we need to adopt and operate the hybrid pyroelectric detectors in both a dome and a wedge trap-arrangement to improve spectral flatness of responsivity. Also, the Spectrum Detector developed SDX-1006 models (earlier made for NIST) will be redesigned and redone in the above SDX-1095 models to decrease the output noise by reducing the LiTaO3 crystal size and its capacitance. The here ordered pyroelectric detectors must be compatible with the earlier purchased pyroelectric detectors. Also, the here ordered housings and radiometers are to be compatible with the temperature controlled and temperature-corrected wedge pyroelectric devices (Models SDX-1006) we have purchased from Spectrum Detector Inc. Item-3 is the further development of the precision current-to-voltage converters Spectrum detector made for us. The signal conversion uncertainty is further improved in the here ordered SDX-1096 unit. The luminance adapter tubes will be matched to the colorimeters made by Spectrum detector for us. The described compatibilities are a must for us to obtain a uniform and compatible detector calibration system. These radiometers will be utilized in Air Force funded CCG projects. The compatibility with the previously purchased Spectrum Detector models is a must to satisfy the construction and the high sensitivity requirements. 

 See Technical specifications:
- Item-1: Gold-coated glass-dome reflects incident radiation (that overfills the front-aperture) back to the temperature controlled 5 mm diameter hybrid detector; NEP10 -8 W/Hz 1/2
- Item-2: Optimization of decreased-size LiTaO3 detector-crystal and mirror wedge arrangement applying specular-black coating to obtain spectrally flat responsivity for the 0.25 to 20 micrometer range; NEP10-8 W/Hz 1/2
- Item-3: Current-to-voltage conversion uncertainty up to 10 10 V/A gain of 0.01 % (k=2)
- Item-4: luminance measurement with an unvignetted field-of-view of 2.2 degree and an out-of-target blocking of more than 4 orders of magnitude for illuminance measuring colorimeters made for NIST by Spectrum Detector Inc.
Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized to provide these before January 25, 2010 at 12:00 pm EST. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates their authorization to meet these requirements.

<DESC>ARRA - The existing contract requires remote gate automation updates on 3 of the 9 the Fox River dams. The remaining 6 were included in the original solicitation as options. However, these options were not awarded due to a lack of available funds. After award of the contract, funding became available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to be utilized on the Fox River project. It was determined that the best use of the funds would be to exercise the options on the existing contract to perform the remote gate automation updates on the remaining dams. NOTE: THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT - W911XK-08-C-0023.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes public Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract to RTD Embedded Technologies, Inc., 103 Innovation Soulevard, P.O. Box 906, State College, PA, 16804-0906. The 49th Contracting Squadron at Holloman AFB, NM 88330 and the 46th Test Squadron intend to award a sole source, firm-fixed price award to RDT Embedded Technologies, Inc.

Interested persons may respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

The proposed source, RTD Embedded Technologies, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the hardware and software system currently in place at the 746th Test Group.

Box 906, State College, PA, 16804-0906. The Sole Source award is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.  According to F5, the only provider of F5 Big IP service is F5.<BR><BR>

This solicitation W912JC-09-R-5712 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This ID-IQ contract is to provide plastic and glass media for paint removal from Kansas Army National Guard vehicles. Base year contract begins April 2009 thru April 2010 with the option for four additional one-year periods.

Estimated quantities/type: Both plastic and glass media will meet commercial standards. It is estimated that 27,500 lbs equals a calendar month of Type II UREA Plastic (Bead Blast Media Type 2, 10-20 Grit) and 5,600 lbs per calendar month of White Blast Glass Media (Number  Designation 2, course, Size Range 10-30, Partial Count 300,000/lb) is estimated for consumption.

The details of the recycle plan shall include the facility location and the recycle process described in a detailed narrative with any needed illustrations, pictures or video to allow for a full understanding of the offeror’s recycle process.  Estimated turn around recycle time lines should be included in the offeror’s recycle plan.  The recycle plan described in detail will be forwarded to this agency must be included with all offeror’s submissions for award consideration.  Submitting a recycle plan does not guarantee technical acceptability.  

1. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make the determination if a proposed recycle plan from the offeror submitting the RFP is legitimate. Any recycle program that is not deemed as legitimate by the EPA will not be considered technically acceptable and thereby removed from consideration for award.

2. The offeror will separately list each drum and the weight of each drum collected on the hazardous waste manifest and on the bill of lading.  The offeror must transport all spent media to their off-base designated recycling facility.  The recycling facility must forward the bill of lading from each container that has completed the recycle process to include the facility disposition report to the Waste Minimization Manager’s office under the Environmental Division at FT Riley of whom will compare recycled material reports with spent material leaving FT Riley.  This will be done to ensure the amount of spent media leaving FT Riley RSMS is equal to the spent media being recycled.  A second copy of these documents shall be sent to the KS RSMS for recordkeeping purposes.

3. The recycle process for the spent media must be recycled within the Continental United States and may not be sent for recycle outside of the US. The recycle program of the awarded company will be subject to audit without notice throughout the entire performance of the contract.

<DESC>The United States Property and Fiscal Office for New York (USPFO-NY) proposes to procure Optometric and Audiologic Evaluations for Soldiers participating in an Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) assessment event conducted at Camp Smith Training Site, Cortlandt Manor, NY 10567 on 23 January 2010.  

BACKGROUND: 
VISION:  
Deploying Soldiers must be in Vision Readiness Class (VRC) One or Two.  Those who are in VRC Three (need corrective lenses to achieve a minimum distant binocular visual acuity of 20/40) are required to be examined optometrically to generate a prescription to correct refractive error and be measured for corrective lens frames and protective mask inserts. Soldiers in VRC Four are in need of annual vision screening.
HEARING:  
Audiologic health is vital for Force health Protection and Soldier Readiness. Failure to achieve proper testing and documentation at specific levels of audiologic function could preclude a soldier from deploying. Audiologic Health, Readiness and Protection is a command responsibility. The Department of Defense (DoD) has established a uniform Hearing Readiness Classification System. Readiness requires that the date of an audiogram performed through the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System – Data Repository (DOEHRS-DR) be recorded in the Medical Protection System (MEDPROS). Pre-mobilization preparation requires a DOEHRS-DR audiogram be done within one year of deployment. In accordance with the All Army Action (ALARACT) 163/2006, dated 6 September 2006, policy now requires all Soldiers with an H2 designation on the physical profile (PULHES) have a complete audiologic evaluation and permanent profiling. Those with an H3 require audiologic evaluation, Speech Recognition in Noise Test (SPRINT), permanent profiling, a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) Medical Review Board (MMRB) for classification, coding and retention. At the present time, members of the Army National Guard do not require annual screening audiograms.

The contractor is required to provide all material, labor, supervision and means required to perform the following:

1.	Visual screening exams - projected 20-25 each
2.	Optometric exams in order to produce lens and frames for Soldiers in VRC 3 - 
                      projected 21 each
3.	Annotate Data on Department of Defense (DD) Form 771 
4.	Complete all demographic information requested on DD Form 771 
5.	Provide timely feedback and work progress/status as to the number of 
                     optometric examinations completed 
6.	Perform approximately 50 screening audiograms
7.	Provide audiologist consultation/evaluation of soldiers with H2 designator 
                     or worse
8.	Provide SPRINT testing on a projected 10 soldiers expected to reveal a PULHES 
                     H3 designation

See Statement Of Work for performance specifications. 

It is intended that the contract be awarded to one vendor.

THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The Small Business size standard is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 115112, Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating, which is $7.0 million average annual income.  

SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas, is seeking a Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, and incidentals required for tree planting and herbaceous weed control of approximately 374.1 acres consisting of four (4) sites for the NRCS Texas Wetland Reserve Program (WRP).   All work shall be done in accordance with the Statement of Work Forest Stand Improvement Texas – Bryan Zone, the tree/shrub establishment Statement of Work, the Tree Planting Plan, and the Herbaceous Weed Control for Hardwood Seedlings Bryan Zone Job Sheet – 490B.  

BACKGROUND:  Restoration projects on these four (4) sites include the planting of hardwood seedlings and herbaceous weed control.  
 
SCOPE OF WORK:   
1.  Pre-Planting Conference:  A pre-planting conference will be held between the contractor, owner (or his agent) and the NRCS to discuss planting operation.  Planting and Herbaceous Weed Treatment will not begin before this the Pre-Planting Conference. 

2.  Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be machine planted on a 10’ X 10’ spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 374.1  acres.  The planting for the area, except for strips around water impoundments, will consist of one mix described in the Tree Planting Plan attachment to this solicitation. 

3.  Species:  Refer to the attached Tree Planting Specifications.  The contractor is responsible for the ordering of the seedlings, their delivery to the site, their care, and, if necessary, cold storage.  The species for 	most of the site are grouped as preferred and secondary.  At least four species will be planted.  Each referred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and secondary species will make up no more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around impoundments.  In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be used. 	

4.  Species Substitution:  If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one.  Contractor must acquire approval from the NRCS for any species substitution.  	

5.  Spacing and Planting Rate:  Hardwood will be planted on a 10’ X 10’ spacing (436 seedlings per acre).  The number of satisfactory planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 370 seedlings per acre.   Areas along the shores of impoundments and natural slough and wet depressions will be planted with the proper species and to the extend that the water depth will allow.  In these areas, spacing will be increase to 15’ X 15’.  

6.  Species Mixes:  Mixes will be achieved through “bag-mixes” and/or matching the species to the site.  Unless otherwise specified in the Tree Planting Plan, row or block plantings of single mixes will be avoided.  Further explanation will be provided at the Pre-Planting Conference. 

7. Seedling Quality:  Seedlings will meet the standards listed in the Tree Planting Specifications.  Both the contractor and the NRCS will determine quality and count by opening one bag of each species being planted.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to discuss seedling quality with the NRCS representative to determine the responsibility to “cull” seedlings according to the standards stated in the Tree Planting Specifications. 

8.  Seedling Care:  It is the responsibility of the contractor to assure proper care of the seedlings during the planting operation.  Planting will begin immediately after receiving the seedlings.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to secure cold storage.  Contractor must ensure that only then number of seedlings that can be planted in a day will be taken to the site and will be kept shaded and moist at all times.  

9.  Pruning:  
	
a.  Roots:  The tap roots may be pruned to a minimum length of 8”.  Lateral roots may be pruned to facilitate planting.  Prune by pulling the laterals down along the tap root or cut to its (the tap’s root’s) length.  Pruning will done only with shears or a sharp knife.  All care must be taken to prevent tearing of roots. 

b.  Tops: Tops may be pruned to a minimum height of 16”. 

10.  Planting Methods:  Seedlings will be machine planted.  Seedlings will be planted with the root collar slightly below the soil surface.  Roost will be not be balled, twisted or planted in a “J” or “U” shaped manner.  Steps needed to ensure the compacting of the soil around the seedling, leaving no air pockets in the planting slit, will be taken.  When optimum site and soil moisture and/or temperature conditions are not available, consult with the NRCS before planting. 

11.  Quality Control:  The Control will be ultimately responsible for quality assurance.  Quality control will be explained during the Pre-Planting Conference.  In addition, NRCS representatives will be available during the first day of planting and will occasionally visit the site during planting.  They will also be available for consultation, but they will not serve as daily inspectors.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide daty-to-day oversight of the planting crews.  NRCS will conduct an inspection at the completion of the planting to determine the acceptability of the planting.   

12.  Herbaceous Weed Control:  Contractor will consult with the NRCS to ensure the proper herbicide is used.  Contractor will acquire approval from the NRCS, beforehand to identify the proper application methods for applying herbicide.   

13.  Environmental Concerns:  herbicides should not be applied within any Streamside Management Zone or any open water.  Some herbicide application rates are tied to soil texture and moisture.  Most have restrictions concerning applying on or near water.  Again, follow the label instructions as well as the Texas Best Management Practice (BMPs). 

AWARD:  The Government will award a firm-fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government.  The anticipated award date is on or before February 19, 2010.  

TIME FRAMES/DATE.  The Tree planting must be completed by March 31, 2010 and herbaceous weed treatment will begin May 1, 2010 and completed by June 30, 2010 after contract award.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 
(1)   The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-851)<br />2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-267-2285<br />Fax: 202-267-4011</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Vendors demonstrating clear separation of clean and soiled processes, including a barrier wall, will be evaluated higher than those without a barrier wall. The government must conduct random inspection of vendor premises monthly; therefore, the vendor facility must be located within a reasonable distance from the AVAHCS. The vendor must be able to personally inspect and review problematic products from the vendor at the AVAHCS within 24 hours of notification of a problem to resolve issues promptly.The vendor must describe its contingency plan to continue to meet the requirements of this work requirement even in cases of emergencies such as failed equipment, utilities, vendor structure, transport, or other systems that may jeopardize continuity of service to the AVAHCS.Vendor is responsible for maintaining full compliance with applicable AVAHCS guidelines, rules, regulations and directives during the full period of performance under the contract as awarded.  Specifically, this includes issues reviewed at contractor orientation to include safety, security, HIPAA compliance, environment of care, contact information, infection control/universal precautions, etc.

<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

There is need for a high speed framing x-ray system to view multiple images from one location. The requirement for this system is to produce multiple x-ray images on a single digital large format screen. For example multiple data points are needed to determine maximum deflection in protective clothing and helmets. If this data were not available, testing and ultimately safety releases on new helmet and body protection materials would be delayed in trying to determine maximum deformation due to threat impacts. This data correlates directly to blunt trauma injuries. Examples in ballistic testing involve threat and counter measure interaction. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of this interaction is required to determine effectiveness of countermeasure techniques. Without x-rays penetration characteristics and multiple data points to view the interaction, multiple testing and longer test schedules would be required to develop and determine effectiveness of these techniques.<BR><BR>NOTES to Offerors:  Offers shall submit system schematics and capabilities in the quote for evaluation.

Interested  contractors must submit the following with their quote.  Quotes, which do not contain this information, may be determined unacceptable, or may be judged as not representing the best overall value to the Government.
1.  Completed SF 1449, Addendum to Section B, or acceptable alternative.  Prices quoted will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness, and realism.  Realism will be used to identify quotes which are unusually low and which therefore indicate a potential misunderstanding of the solicitations requirements, or which increase the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
2.  Past Performance  Information which evidences the level of quality in which the Contractor has performed prior similar contracts.  Based on the quotes received, the Government may contact some, all, or none of the references provided.  A vendors level of past performance may be evaluated solely on the information provided by that vendor.  Therefore vendors are advised to submit no less than the following information for three similar (scope and work) contracts performed in the past three years:
a.	 Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offerors proposal and data obtained from other sources.  However, the burden of providing thorough, complete, and current past performance information as requested in this paragraph remains the offerors responsibility.  Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.<BR><BR>b.	The offeror shall ensure that the documentation required in support of Past Performance is supplied by the evaluating agency to the Contracting Officer.  It is the offerors responsibility to follow up with the evaluating customer to ascertain if the required information has been forwarded prior to the established closing date.  The Government will not seek out corrections to incomplete or insufficient information on behalf of offerors.  Unverifiable information will not be considered in the past performance assessment. NOTES:  No Past Performance Survey submittals (mailed, emailed, or faxed) will be accepted from the offeror being evaluated.  The offeror should verify completion and submittal of the forms with the agencies/companies to which they provided the questionnaire.

BUYER ANSWER #1:  Per the Program Office, We would like 6 users and 5 users to have independent access and use of the services.  It can be under the same account, as the users are co-located in [the same Division].
SELLER QUESTION 2:  You request separate pricing for "Newswire Distribution" and "unlimted email distribution" (in addition to news monitoring, analysis, etc)...How are you differentiating the technical requirements for "Newswire Distribution" vs. "email distribution?"   Or, do you consider NewsWire Distribution and email distribution to be the same thing?  The reason I ask is that I know of companies other than PR Newswire who offer one or the other, but not both, and I am concerned that you will receive very low-priced bids that claim to provide "newswire distrbution" when in reality it is just email or web-only distribution, NOT an actual AP newswire feed to newsrooms, which the BATF is accustomed to.  Please provide a technical specification or requirement as to how the government will evaluate/determine what is and what is not "Newswire Distribution" so that we can submit the most competitive bid for the BATF for the services required. 
 
BUYER ANSWER 2:  To clarify, newswire distribution is a direct newswire feed to newsrooms (much like the Associated Press feed); ATF news releases would be pushed to news directors or one location in all newsrooms.  The email distribution function is just that; the service needs to push ATF news releases directly to reporters (via email) who cover ATF, law enforcement and criminal matters for news organizations.  The vendor would need to build those email distribution lists, with ATF assistance if necessary.<BR><BR>SELLER QUESTION #3:  Are the users sharing access to the application (e.g. One License/One Account) or are the users required to have their own individual licenses that are unique to each user? BUYER ANSWER #3:  Users can share access to the application.  One license for ATF PAD with multiple, equal users (6) is what we want.  We dont need six unique, customized licenses.
a.      PAD needs at least six staff members to be able to send news releases to the vendor for distribution to newsroom wires services and to specific email distribution lists.
b.      The vendor would need to build news media email distribution lists so that news release dissemination is targeted to reporters who cover ATF, law enforcement and criminal matters.

SELLER QUESTION #4:  Regarding LI 005, Does the client want broadcast content (e.g. video and text) within the News Clipping Service or only print and online sources? 
BUYER ANSWER #4:  PAD needs the vendor capture news stories that mention ATF (and other key words) in print and online sources, to include broadcast (TV) news outlets.
c.       Many TV news stations and networks publish their broadcasted stories in text form on their company websites.  PAD needs the vendor to clip those stories and provide them daily, along with print (newspaper) articles.
d.      PAD would like to know about the possible and potential costs for providing video content.<BR><BR>Q: The number of 'user accounts' required - as the listing indicates -are six (6) and five (5). This will mean concurrent use (using thesystem at the same time). Please confirm.  A single account (one user)can be used by 5 or 6 different people as long as they access thesystemat different times.  The key issue, again, is 'concurrent use.A: Concurrent use is preferred, but not necessary.<BR><BR>Q: I understand this is a all or nothing bid, however there is nocompany that offers Wire, Clipping (Print & Online), MediaDatabase,etc...without contracting with another company.  I am wondering if thisis acceptable?A: Whatever Teaming Arrangements you make/have are fine; please knowthat we will have privity of contract w/that 1 Vendor.<BR><BR>Q1:  I also have some additional questions/qualifiers on the clippingaspect in regard to how many clips and exactly what they are looking foras far as numbers.  There is no company that can give a set fee unlessthey cap the number of clips.A1:  The number of  links will be determined by the number of mentionsof ATF. Q2:  When will payment be made for the first year and subsequent optionyears?A2: The first year of the contract will be paid in full upon award ofthe contract.  Determinations regarding full or monthly payments [of theoption years] will be decided pending review of the prior year'sservice. Q3:     Does the ATF require translations and editorial or will they behandling that aspect on their own?A3:  ATF would like contractor to provide translation services, however,the agency  will make a determination based upon cost estimates.Translation services are not mandatory. Q4:  In general, what are the feature requirements for reports,web-based software, and media content?A4:  Monthly media reports should be submitted via email as Worddocuments. Q5:  Internet Content: can results be excerpts and links, or is fulltext and links required? (NOTE: excerpts and links is a copyrightcompliant format and results may be  shared internally and externallywithout need for a copyright-compliance program)A5:  Links and, possibly, excerpts will be sufficient. Q6:  What is the subject matter for the search and is there arequirement for back-search capability?A6:  Mentions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives(ATF), in general, as well as specific subject matter as needed. A listof key words, for daily searches, will be provided by ATF upon award ofthis contract. Q7:  How many recipients, on average, are going to viewcopyright-protected content for internal use?  Is there a need for acopyright-compliance program?  (Full text and  scanned images ofarticles, whether print or internet media, is protected by copyrightlaw)A7:  ATF requires submission of links and, possibly, excerpts. Q8:  Is one username and password that can be shared by multipleinternal departmental users acceptable?A8:  Yes. Q9:  What is the expectation on speed of delivery for Internet and PrintMedia?A9:  Twenty-four hour monitoring service, with delivery to ATF by 6 amdaily. Q10:  Print Media: Is a delivery of a couple days to a couple weeksacceptable for delivery turnaround time from date of publication?A10:  No. Q11:  Is there a requirement for an automated daily report via email, oris there a feature requirement for such a report?A11:  ATF requests daily media monitoring service and one monthlyreport.

If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

Horizontal storage is not satisfactory because of the requirement for reversing at 6 month intervals. Wheel assemblies with an average weight of 300 lbs stack 6-10 assemblies high on pallet for a minimum of 31 months; (ship cycle) would damage sidewall of tires, degrading readiness<br /><br />Specs for the racks:<br /><br />-4,000 lb capacity (maximum tire wt for HMMWV tire assembly is approx 600 lbs and 7 tires fit in the profile giving 4200 lbs max wt for max loaded racks) <br /><br />-Stackable to 4-high with quick disconnect fastening for possible warehouse employment during deployment.<br /><br />-Fits the profile of a 8.5 feet high, 8 feet wide, 20 feet long container with minimal blocking and bracing.<br /><br />-Loadable outside the container (must load heavy tires using MHE for stacked racks because of wt and cannot do that inside a container. Not unique to racks) <br /><br />-Free standing. (Don't want to have to bolt and unbolt a rack to get them in and out of containers) <br /><br />-Forkliftable - 4-way entry loaded and empty. (We can put in side-opening containers and dual end-opening containers to give full flexibility in loading) <br /><br />-One size fits most size tires.

(Some tire/wheel assemblies weigh nearly 2000 lbs a tire, so having the same capacity for a rack that is half the width of the container allows you to maximize storage capacity for those items) <br /><br />-Reusable.<br /><br />-Galvanized to resist environmental deterioration.

<DESC><strong>The RFP&nbsp;remains in the final review phase.&nbsp; Please see the below&nbsp;change to the Acquisition Schedule</strong><br /><br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTAR),&nbsp;Cooperative&nbsp;Threat Reduction Directorate (CT), announces its intention to compete&nbsp;a requirement for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS).&nbsp; <br /><br />The DTRA mission is to safeguard America and its allies from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosives) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat, and mitigate its effects. The mission of the CT program is to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and related materials, technologies and expertise from former Soviet Union (FSU) states. This includes providing for the safe destruction of Soviet era WMD, associated delivery systems and related infrastructure. The CT objectives are
<p>&bull; Dismantle threat WMD and associated infrastructure;<br />&bull; Consolidate and secure threat WMD and related technology and materials;<br />&bull; Increase transparency and encourage higher standards of conduct;<br />&bull; Support defense and military cooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation,<br />&bull; Synchronize CTR activities with related U.S. Government and allied programs</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain professional advisory, management, and operational services necessary to support CT in its Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and associated mission areas. Required tasks may fall into the categories listed below or encompass other activities which directly support the CT mission.</p>
<p>&bull; Technical Support<br />&bull; Analytical and Planning Support<br />&bull; Program Management Support<br />&bull; Administrative Support</p>
The A&amp;AS acquisition will be an unrestricted full and open competition,&nbsp;executed using FAR Part 15 Contract by Negotiation.&nbsp; The contract will be awarded to a single contractor,&nbsp;using FAR 15-101-1 Tradeoff Process, that represents best value to the Government. The basic contract will be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) with an ordering period of five years. CT will obtain specific A&amp;AS support through individually funded Task Orders, with a typical period of performance of one year. Task Orders will be Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), or Firm-Fixed Price (FFP).<br /><br />A Draft L (instruction, conditions and notices to offerors) and M (evalution factors for award) and the Statement of Objectives are attached for review and comments.&nbsp; <strong>Other draft sections of the RFP will be provided as they become available.<br /></strong><br />After reviewing the attached documents, Contractors shall provide all Comments, Suggestion, and Questions to the POC by <strong>1600 EST 16 December 2009.</strong>&nbsp; All Comments, Suggestions, and Questions, will be posted to this announcement along with DTRA responses and answers.&nbsp; <br /><br />The&nbsp;current&nbsp;schedule&nbsp;for this requirement is as follows:<br /><br />Release of the Draft RFP - 02 Dec 2009 (2 weeks for comments)<br /><br />Release of the Final RFP -&nbsp;<strong>30 Jan 2010</strong><br /><br />Proposals Due -&nbsp;<strong>26 Feb 2010</strong><br /><br />Anticipated Contract Award - April 2010<br /><br /><br />More information related to this requirement can be found by searching for the &nbsp;"sources sought" announcement number CTI090014815.<br />

<br /><strong>**The Government has added a 33 Q&amp;A.<br /></strong><br />**Offerors are reminded that the responses to these questions reflect the current condition of the procurement. The final RFP may differ and the differences may be inconsistent with these responses. The changes in the final RFP, if any, supersede responses to questions. Offerors will be required to propose to the final RFP.<br /><br /><br /><strong>DRAFT SOLICITATION QUESTIONS and ANSWERS</strong>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 1:</strong>Reference Section L.4.3. There is a reference to a form called Attachment L1. This attachment is not included as part of the draft. L-1 is critical to offerors ability to begin the development of our Past Performance section and having the template in advance of the final RFP will allow offerors to take advantage of the time between the draft RFP and final proposal submission to build our Past Performance responses using the Government directed format. Has this document been developed by the Government? If so we would request that the Government release it as soon as possible. <br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) Attachment L-1 is currently being tailored for this solicitation and will be made available on FedBizOps for all interested offerors as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 2:</strong> Are second-tier subcontractors permitted, and, if so, how will the size status of said 2nd-tier subcontractors affect the attainment of socioeconomic subcontracting goals?<br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em>Second-tier subcontractors are certainly permitted on DTRA contracting opportunities, but for the purpose of the subject solicitation they will not count toward a prime offeror's subcontracting/socio-economic goal. Offerors must note that the stated DTRA subcontracting/socio-economic goals are tied to the prime offeror through its first-tier subcontractors.<br /><br /><strong>Question/Comment 3:</strong> Reference L.3.3.3.1. requires that &lsquo;all personnel be identified by labor category, a description of the position, skill level associated with the position,' etc. Even using the smallest allowable font, a table providing this information would be extremely lengthy and would take away needed space from the explanation of the technical approach. We recommend that the personnel response required by L.3.3.3.1 be outside the page limits for Volume II.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will allow unlimited pages for the labor chart required under Section L.3.3.3.1. The final RFP will update Section L.1.2 with the revised page limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 4:</strong>Reference M.2.3. Evaluation subfactors to Factor 1 are referred to as subfactors A-E and subfactors 1-5. To provide clarity in the required cross-reference matrix that the Offeror provides with the proposal, could the Government define which notation they prefer?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will revise the subfactors for Factor 1 to reflect subfactors A-E. This revision will be included in the final RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 5:</strong>Reference SOO 2.1, 2.2, 2.3; L.1.2, (Table 1-2); L.3.3.3.1 (first sentence). Section L asks that the offeror 'express its technical understanding and approaches to performing all technical objectives as delineated in the SOO.' The SOO is a comprehensive document that delineates 31 tasks, many of which require a detailed explanation. Section L also defines additional information requirements to be included in the proposal. For the offeror to provide the government with a description of its capabilities detailed enough to facilitate a thorough evaluation, we recommend that the page limit for the Technical Approach section of the Mission Capability volume be increased.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will allow a total of 20 pages for technical approach. This change will be reflected in Section L.1.2 in the final RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 6:</strong>Reference M.2.4.1, L.3.3.2.1. M.2.4.1, last paragraph, states that the commitment to socio-economic goals will be evaluated as part of the Mission Capability volume. However, the corresponding instruction at L.3.3.2.1 does not require this subject be addressed there. Instead, socio-economic goals are covered in Volume I (L.2.12), and offeror's response in that volume may not be seen by the evaluators of Volume II. We suggest that offeror's socio-economic goals be evaluated as part of the evaluation of Volume I. Alternatively, to save space in a severely page limited proposal, would the Government permit a brief cross-reference from the offeror's response to Volume II, directing the evaluator to Volume I?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Yes, Offerors may cross-reference Volume I as part of their Volume II socio-economic response. See L.1.3.10 that explains cross-references.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 7:</strong>Reference L.2.7. To allow sufficient time for review and comment, we request that the proposed DD 254 be released in advance of the final RFP.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will post the DD254 as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 8:</strong>Reference L.1.2 (Table 1-2). To allow Offerors to provide present and past performance information sufficient to support a thorough evaluation, we request that the pages allowed for each reference be increased.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will allow 4 pages per reference for Attachment L-1, as defined in Section L.4.3 and the table in L.1.2. The final RFP will be revised to reflect the changes to page allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 9:</strong>Reference SOO 2.3.6. SOO paragraph 2.3.6 describes specific capabilities required in the biological threat reduction program area. Specifically the requirement statement reads "Provide the capability to support the areas of ...veterinary and public health system design and associated fields of study."<br />Should the phrase associated fields of study be interpreted to imply that capabilities are limited only to veterinary and public health systems? <br /><em>Government Response:</em>The SOO paragraph 2.3.6 has been updated and revised to state: <br />"Provide the capability to support the areas of disease surveillance, detection and diagnostics; laboratory operations; biological safety and security, infectious disease medicine, epidemiology, research development and oversight, to include human and veterinary user requirements; associated fields of study for veterinary and public health system designs, which would be beneficial to the Biological Threat Reduction Program."</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 10:</strong>Reference L.2.13. Paragraph b requires a statement in Volume I concerning OCI. Further, Section L.3.3.2.1 Management Plan also requires an OCI mitigation statement in Volume II. How do these requirements differ?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The OCI requirement in L.3.3.2.1 will be deleted. The Final RFP will reflect the change.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 11:</strong>Reference L.3.3.5. Can the government provide relative time frames for the scenario to aid offerors in pricing the scenario?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Sample Scenario will not be priced.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 12:</strong>Reference M.2.4.1. One of the elements required to satisfy this factor is a OCI Mitigation Plan, vice statement as referred to in Sections L.2.13 and L.3.3.2.1. Is the use of the terminology Plan and Statement the same? If not, can the Government provide guidance on what is expected in the OCI Plan?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Please note that the Government will revise the OCI provision in the final RFP. Solicitation provisions L.3.3.2.1 and M.2.4.1 will be deleted. The remaining OCI provision, L.2.13, will require an offeror's statement as to whether an OCI (as defined in section FAR 9.5 "Organization and Consultant Conflicts of Interest") exists and whether a mitigation plan may be required. The offeror may elect to submit a mitigation plan with their proposal (offer) but, if there is an OCI, the Contracting Officer will require a mitigation plan prior to contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 13:</strong>Reference M.1.1 and M.2.2.1. Section M.1.1 states that Mission Capability has four (4) subfactors. Section M.2.2.1 shows five (5) subfactors listed under the Mission Capability factor. Are offerors correct in assuming that there are five (5) Mission Capability subfactors?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Section M.1.1 will be revised to reflect 5 subfactors.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 14:</strong>Reference H, 52-234-4 Earned Value Management System (Jul 2009). Does DTRA intend to require the monthly submittal of full Contract Performance Reports as generated from a validated Earned Value Management System (EVMS)? Although the intended contract type is cost-reimbursable, the nature of the work appears to be overwhelmingly of the Level of Effort (LOE) type. The application of EVM on work that is LOE in nature typically is impractical and inefficient. If DTRA intends to tailor the EVMS requirement, what is the anticipated extent of the tailoring? <br /><em>Government Response:</em>The EVMS requirement will be completely removed from the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 15:</strong>Reference L.2.13, L.3.3.2.1 (last bullet). The last paragraph in L.3.3.2.1 of the draft RFP implies that should a real or perceived OCI be identified and disclosed the Government may consider mitigation strategies to permit a contractor or subcontractor to continue the delivery of service provided the mitigation strategies are determined by the Contracting Officer to be adequate for the circumstance. Does this also apply to contractors and subcontractors providing services under the CTRIC and BTRIC contract vehicles? <br /><em>Government Response:</em>See RFP clause H.6.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 16:</strong>Reference Section H.6. In reference to paragraph H.6 which states "the Contractor and its subcontractors are precluded from participating directly or indirectly as contractors or subcontractors on any other contracts which provide support to Cooperative Threat Reduction Directorate of DTRA..." <br />Is it correct to assume directly or indirectly means as a prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier and/or to perform as a contractor or subcontractor whereby the procuring agency is other than the CTR Directorate but the CTR Directorate is the end user or a 3rd party benefiting organization?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The intent of this clause is to limit the A&amp;AS contractor from performing as a contractor of other procurements where CTR is the requiring activity (i.e. the organization generating the requirement or the "end user") The clause will be amended to read as follows: "The contractor and its subcontractors are precluded from participating, directly or indirectly, as a contractor or subcontractor on any other contracts where the Cooperative Threat Reduction Directorate of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is the requiring activity during the period of the A&amp;AS contract or, in case of subcontractors, during the period they are subcontracted to this A&amp;AS effort."</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 17:</strong>In some instances, Offerors may wish to submit Past Performance references for work they have been performing as a subcontractor. In some of these instances the Prime contractor may now be a competitor for this CTR A&amp;AS solicitation. In order to avoid potential conflicts (such as bias) when submitting past performance references for subcontracted work, we assume the Government will allow Offerors to send their Past Performance Questionnaires directly to their Government points of contract instead of vetting them through the prime contractor. Is this assumption acceptable to the Government?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The subcontractors will send their PPQs directly to the Government POCs (end users), and not to the prime contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 18:</strong>Reference M2.4.2, Sub factor 2 Technical Approach (bullet 1 and 3) asks for offeror's to demonstrate an approach and process to assign personnel based on labor categories, skill level and qualifications to fulfill the requirements of the SOO. Bullet 2 references a comprehensive plan, it is our assumption that bullets 1 and 3 cover the comprehensive plan. Is our assumption correct or is there additional information that the Government is looking for in this section? <br />If our assumption is correct we would recommend that bullet 2 be deleted as it is redundant. If our assumption is incorrect we request that the Government provide additional guidance/clarification on what additional information you want to have included as part of the comprehensive plan.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will delete bullet 2 for consistency and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 19:</strong>L.3.3.3.1 asks that all personnel be identified by labor category, a description of the position and skill level associated with the position. Since this table will take up a considerable amount of space we recommend that it be excluded from the 15 page limit. By excluding the table from the page count it will allow offerors to provide more detailed technical responses.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 3 (labor chart is now unlimited pages)</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 20:</strong>Reference L.2.13. Pre-award Organization Conflicts of Interest is called out in Volume I. L.3.3.2.1. bullet 8 calls for an OCI mitigation statement. Recommend that L.3.3.2.1 bullet 8 be moved into Volume I to minimize cross referencing between the volumes. <br /><em>Government Response:</em> See Question 12 response.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 21:</strong>"The government has requested the contractor "provide a document management system and library to support the storage and retrieval of electronic and paper CTR documentation compliant with DoD Records Management procedures..." Does the Government expect that the tool used to support electronic records management is on the JITC PRODUCT REGISTER for DoD 5015.02-STD Records Management Compliance or is the existing Docushare system and paper records management procedures sufficient to meet the records management compliance requirement stated in 2.3.23?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government does not prescribe that the systems currently used for this purpose be maintained/continued by the successful Offeror. The Government requires expertise to: analyze current CT processes and procedures, determine if the current records management software system is optimal, make recommendations regarding potential courses of action to achieve compliance with relevant requirements, support execution of Government approved courses of action, and oversee future compliance. The government has no comment on whether a suitable records management system is on the JITC Product Register. The government will consider the recommendations provided by the contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 22:</strong>Reference SOO. What is the current level of A&amp;AS effort supporting the CTR? Please provide a list of current A&amp;AS contractor positions filled and unfilled with the following information: the mission area they support; the labor category; whether a security clearance/US citizenship is held or required; the place of their work assignment (on-site, off-site, at another Government agency, overseas at what site); specific language skill required; and current labor rate.<br /><em>Government Response: <br /></em>The current level of support and the areas supported by the A&amp;AS effort is detailed in the Industry Day presentation posted to FedBizOps July 29, 2009. The labor category and rates used by the current contractor are trade secret/protected information. The language skills required are detailed in section 2.3.21 of the posted SOO. Security clearance requirements are listed on the form DD 254. <br />The number of contractor personnel posted outside of DTRA headquarters and the contractor facility are as follows:<br />OSD/CTR Policy: 4 FTEs<br />OSD/Eurasia: 2 FTEs<br />DTRO Armenia: 1 FTE<br />DTRO Azerbaijan: 4 FTEs<br />DTRO Georgia: 5 FTEs <br />DTRO Kazakhstan: 4 FTEs<br />DTRO Uzbekistan: 1 FTE<br />SOAE Russia: 5.5 FTEs<br />BTRP Russia: 4 FTEs<br />CWE Russia: 0.5 FTEs</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 23:</strong>Reference SOO L.3.3.2.1. Program Assistant is a generic but unclear description of a key staff position. Please clarify the role envisioned that a Program Assistant would perform<br /><em>Government Response:</em> <br />There is no SOO reference L.3.3.2.1. <br />Section L.3.3.2.1 of the draft RFP refers to a lead Program Assistant. The government has determined that this is not considered a key staff position, and will be eliminated from the language of the final RFP. However, the current Program Assistant position traditionally has the responsibility for administrative functions performed on-site at DTRA headquarters. These activities include: cable coordination, correspondence assistance, providing quality control of products, travel coordination, task tracking, file management, translation coordination, report coordination, and schedule functions.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 24:</strong>Reference SOO Paragraph 2.3.28. We assume the level of classification for discussions, meetings and materials handling at the contractor provided facility is Secret. Please confirm.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> That information will be provided on the DD254.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 25:</strong>Reference SOO Paragraph 2.1.12. CTR interacts with many US Government or non-government agencies in the accomplishment of its mission. Please provide a list of applicable MOUs or MOAs with those agencies.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>CTR has no MOUs or MOAs in place pertaining to its provision of contractor support personnel to organizations outside of CTR.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 26:</strong>Reference SOO Paragraph 2.3.31. requires ". . . an orderly, complete transition from the incumbent A&amp;AS contractor, including preservation of and uninterrupted access to all program information stored and maintained in the incumbent's information/document management system." Will the Government provide details of the incumbents existing information/document management system? Can we assume that DTRA will provide "the incumbent's information/document management system" to the new contractor (or is it the intention to have the selected contractor implement a new management system?)?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The current information/document management system is a Commercial, Off-the-Shelf System, which will be provided to the successful Offeror upon contract award. However, the successful offeror is not obligated to use this software; recommendations to update the CTR IT support infrastructure will be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 27:</strong> Reference Section L. What is the difference between the "Technical Approach" (Section L.1.2) and the "Technical Plan" (L.3.3.3.1)? There are no other sub-sections called out in the L.3.3.3.1 Technical Approach, and the page limit does not support adequate discussion. We assume Technical Approach and Technical Plan are synonymous in this usage. Please confirm.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>There is no difference. The single Subsections of Management Approach and Technical Approach will be removed to reduce confusion. The final RFP will reflect this change.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 28:</strong> Reference Section L.4.3. Do Forms L-1 count against the two-page past performance limit? What is the page limit for Forms L-1?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 8.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 29:</strong> Reference Section L.3.3.2.1 Management Plan. Within the statement in the second paragraph "senior technical experts for all areas shall be identified," The term "all areas" is ambiguous but we presume it to be "each of the CT program areas". Can you provide clarification?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Depending on the approach taken by the Offeror, all areas could span CT, or could be specific to the divisions of CT. An example could be a technical expert in Systems Engineering, who could oversee all aspects of their expertise throughout CT, whereas an expert in veterinary medicine would likely be specific to the BTRP program area.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 30:</strong>Reference Section L.3.3.4 Transition Plan. : A transition requires the participation of the outgoing incumbent. Please provide a copy of the incumbent's transition out plan or, if a specific transition out plan does not exist, a statement of transition out activities that the incumbent is contractually obligated to support. <br /><em>Government Response:</em>The incumbent's "transition out plan" was placed on FedBizOps October 8, 2009, and will be transitioned to the final Solicitation announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 31:</strong> Reference Section L.5.1. Please clarify if information other than cost or pricing data is required. The first two sentences in the last paragraph of L.5.1 are confusing as to what is required now versus potentially some time in the future<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Per the last paragraph in section L.5.1 the offeror is required to provide "information other than cost and pricing data" in response to the Final RFP. The paragraph goes on to state that if, after proposals have been received, the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition did not occur and other exceptions do not exist (See FAR 15.403-1 (b)), the offeror may need to provide current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data. However, until notified by the Contracting Officer, offerors should anticipate providing "information other than cost and pricing data" in their response to the RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 32</strong>: Reference Section M Paragraph M.1.1, Basis for Contract Award. The first sentence cites the number of sub-factors for Mission Capability as "four (4)." Elsewhere it is cited as five (5) sub-factors, and five are listed in M.2.2.1. Please confirm the intent is to evaluate the five (5) Mission Capability factors in M.2.2.1.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 13</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Question/Comment 33:</strong>In the interest of really understanding the processes and needs of CTR, would the Government entertain the idea of creating a virtual "reading room" where examples of current deliverables that CTR produces and is responsible for would be available for offerors to view and assess? This reading room could also include process flows that CTR uses for business and reporting functions. This would provide potential offerors the opportunity to identify and consider process improvements by comparison of current documents and processes to proven or best of breed processes employed elsewhere and directly applicable to the CTR mission and responsibilities.<br /><em>Government Response: <br /></em>We have created an acquisition library&nbsp;(see CTI090014815 announcement)&nbsp;to provide offerors information we think will be beneficial to understanding the CTR organization. We will continue to assess whether additional information can be useful to potential offerors and will add that information where warranted.</p>

The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>Pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2512(a)) (TAA), Federal acquisitions of supplies may be made only from offerors that will supply products of an eligible country under any of the free trade agreements entered into pursuant to the TAA. An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support.  This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.  
ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components.
Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the updated final solicitation number, and to provide the Government's response to questions and comments received for the Draft Solicitation N68936-09-R-0066.
The final solicitation number will be N68936-10-R-0022, and it will be available through NECO and FEDBIZOPPS.
Questions/Comments received for the Draft Solicitation and the Government's response are as follows:
1. Q: Contract Terminology: In most cases the contract is referred to as "WSISS".  However, on pages 4 and 117 of the DRFP, the term WSISS3 is used. What is the correct term?
A: For proposal purposes, please refer to the prospective contract as WSISS.
2. Q: Past Performance Page Count: Instructions for Volume 3, paragraph vii places a page count limit of 10 pages on Relevant Contract Experience. However, paragraph viii allows 3 pages for Systematic Improvement discussion. Is the total page count for these two section 13 pages - or is the paragraph viii allocation included in the 10 pages allotted in paragraph vii?
A: The limits imposed for Volume III are as follows: 
- The prime offeror must present for evaluation no more than three (3) contracts or subcontracts, limited to 10 pages each.
-Each proposed subcontractor must present for evaluation no more than two (2) contracts or subcontracts, limited to 10 pages each.
-The discussion on Systemic Improvement is separate, and the three (3) page limitation is in addition to all other requirements.  
3. Q: Section C, Performance Work Statement (PWS), C2.1.7(i) states "The requirement that Offerors submit a proposed Software Development Plan (SDP) with their proposals, and, during contract performance, deliver a completed SDP (based on the proposed SDP)".  This implies that a SDP is a required part of the response to the solicitation.  However, there is no explicit requirement for a SDP in section L.  Please clarify - is a SDP required to be submitted with our proposal?  If yes, what are the requirements for the SDP.
A: If a SDP is determined to be required, a proposal will be requested at the Task Order level. The Government is not requesting a SDP in this solicitation.
4. Q: Section B - Supplies or Services and Prices, has been provided in an non-editable format with the draft solicitation.  Will an editable MSWord 2003 document be provided before or with the final solicitation?
A: The Government will provide the final solicitation in an editable format, posted on NECO and FEDBIZOPPS.
5. Q: Section K - Representations, Certifications and Other Statements of Offerors, has been provided in an non-editable format with the draft solicitation.  Will an editable MSWord 2003 document be provided before or with the final solicitation?
A: See the answer to question number four above.
6. Q: Section L, 5252.215-9520 I (a), page 101, states that for Volume IV (Cost/Price), the offeror must submit 6 paper copies.  However, Section L, 5252.215-9520 I (e) (4) (iii) (1), page 115, states the offeror must submit Original and 6 copies - 7 copies total.  Please clarify the number of copies for Volume IV.
A: The correct number of copies for Volume IV is six (6) total.
7. Q: Section L, 5252.215-9520 I (e) (3) (vi), page 113, states "shall solicit one (1) Past Performance Survey (Attachment 4 to the Solicitation)".  However, the survey appears as Attachment 6 in the draft solicitation.  Is the section L reference in the draft solicitation incorrect?  
A: This was a typographical error.  The survey will be Attachment 6 in the final solicitation.
8. Q: Attachment 6 - Contractor Past Performance Evaluation Survey and Confirmation of Completed Contractor Past Performance Evaluation Survey, have been provided in an non-editable format with the draft solicitation.  Will an editable MSWord 2003 document be provided before or with the final solicitation?
A: See the answer to question number four above.

List direct costs not included in the above categories (i.e., special tooling, computer services, preservation, and packaging). Provide basis of estimate (i.e., vendor quotes, catalog pricing, subcontracting estimates). Competitive historical price information of prior purchases is adequate. <BR><BR><BR><BR>5.	Section M  Evaluation Factors for Award<BR><BR>a.	Section M.1.1 General Basis for Contract Award is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:<BR><BR>M.1.1. GENERAL BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD - This will be a competitive source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101.1. The contract award is based on a determination of Best Value to the Government (see FAR 15.1). This determination is based on an integrated assessment of ratings for Evaluation Factors (Section M.3.2), Proposal Risk rating, and Performance Risk rating. Offeror(s) shall be responsible under the FAR procedures and shall submit proposals conforming to the solicitation requirements. The Government intends to select the source whose offer is most overall advantageous to the Government; however, the Government<BR>reserves the right to reject any or all proposals and to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted and the availability of funds. The Government reserves the right to conduct written or oral<BR>discussions and surveys as it deems necessary or appropriate before contract award. <BR><BR>The proposals shall be complete, shall arrive by the date and time indicated, and shall be compliant with all instructions. The Offeror shall refer to Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors) for proposal preparation.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that only one award will be made as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP)<BR><BR><BR>Questions and Answers<BR><BR><BR><BR>B.	This amendment is issued to answer the questions submitted as of January 7, 2010 and listed below.  As a result of this amendment, the hour and date specified for receipt of Offers is not extended and remains February 17, 2010.  <BR><BR><BR>1.	What is the technology readiness level of an acceptable product?<BR><BR>The minimum acceptable Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for this solicitation is a TRL 3.  The definition of a TRL 3 product is detailed in the attached memorandum dated December 17, 2008.   <BR><BR><BR>2.	Is there a target product profile for this countermeasure? If so, where is it published?<BR><BR>"	The Capability Development Document (CDD) is in draft form and is not published at this time.  The target product profile is described in the Statement of Objectives (SOO), as shown in the references below. <BR>"	A therapeutic countermeasure that demonstrates efficacy when administered a minimum of 4 hours following exposure to radiation sufficient to cause the gastrointestinal (GI) subsyndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  (C.2.)<BR>"	Countermeasure exerts its effect directly on the incipient or manifest radiation injury suffered by the GI tract. (C.2.)<BR>"	 Minimal logistical burden<BR>o	The medical radiation countermeasure shall be operational across a wide range of temperatures.   It is favorable to have a shelf life greater than 2 years at a storage temperature of 20-35 degrees Celsius.  (C.3.3.1)<BR>o	A final product formulation suitable for administration in humans and a delivery system suitable for military use.  (C.3.3.2)<BR><BR><BR>3.	What does the Government require as a back up for insurance estimates?<BR><BR>The Government requires vendor quotes, catalog pricing, or competitive historical price information of prior purchases.  See amended Section L.4.1.4.6 - Other Costs.<BR><BR><BR>4.	If the Offeror cannot procure insurance, will the Government provide indemnification?<BR><BR>Under 10 USC 2354 (DFARS 235.070-1) SEC ARMY may, if justified by an awardee, authorize indemnification of resulting contract(s) for advanced development. Indemnification before award is not feasible and only a contract may be indemnified. Proposals shall not be conditioned on receipt of indemnification and performance shall not be delayed because of a request of indemnification is being processed.<BR><BR><BR>5.	On Pg. 12, CLIN 0006 states within 1 year of exercise of 2,500, to ship to address same as above which means ship to CBMS-MITS 64 Thomas Johnson Drive Frederick, MD 21702. Please confirm that 2,500 MRC are to be delivered to this address.<BR><BR>Section F - CLIN 0006 was amended to Ship in place.<BR><BR><BR>6.	Likewise, on Pg. 12, CLINs 0007, 0008, 0009, 0010 state to deliver the MRC to Ship in place. Does this mean to retain the MRC in storage at the location where it was developed? Please clarify.<BR><BR>The delivery location will be provided following exercise of the option.<BR> <BR><BR>7.	Given the nature of this type of research and development effort, and that the majority of the proposed CLINs are to be Firm Fixed Price, and that they will most likely go out several years, along with the current volatile economy, would the Government consider receipt of a legitimate estimate of the pricing for the out-years? We are certain that the pricing will change over time of which we have little control. Will the Government accept this type of pricing estimate for initial consideration, and then permit the Offeror to update the costs annually?<BR><BR>The Government understands the nature of the Research and Development effort.  Firm-fixed pricing is required for low-risk areas and the Government will not accept updating the costs annually for Firm-fixed price CLINs.  <BR><BR><BR>8.	By my reading, funding is anticipated in October 2010 and the first deliverable is due June 2011. That first deliverable includes the completion of a Phase I trial. Therefore, would an IND need to be filed within 2-3 months of funding?<BR><BR>The timing of IND filing is specific to each Offeror.  However, it is expected that the Offeror complete the activities associated with CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002 no later than June, 2011.  Funding will be available at time of contract award and contract award is anticipated in May/June 2010.  <BR><BR><BR>9.	When would you anticipate having completed the review and being able to commit that funding will be forthcoming?<BR><BR>As shown in Section L  Instructions to Offerors, additional funds are envisioned in subsequent DoD Budgets, starting with the FY12-17 POM (L.1.1.9).  A better estimate of the FY12-17 POM funding will be available by mid-FY11.  However, the funding provided in L.1.1.9 provides the current planned budget for this program.  Unfunded requirements and additional POM funding will be requested in addition to the current budget.  <BR><BR><BR>10.	Given that $12.9M has been budgeted through 2013, will there be multiple awards under this solicitation?<BR><BR>As stated in Section M.1.1 The Government intends to select the source whose offer is most overall advantageous to the Government; however, the Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals and to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted and the availability of funds. It is anticipated that only one award will be made as a result of this Request for Proposal.  <BR><BR><BR>11.	Can you further define the Phase 1 study?  Is the Phase 1 study the complete human safety trial (dose finding, safety, large population)? <BR> <BR>The Phase 1 study is the complete human safety trial needed to initiate expanded Phase 2 clinical trials.  Any human safety studies needed for FDA approval that are not completed shall be included in the technical approach provided in the proposal in order to complete Phase 1.  <BR><BR><BR>12.	Is it correct that the Past Performance section requires both submission by the Offeror (us) and reports by the PO's on ongoing and prior Government grants and contracts?  <BR><BR>Yes, the Offeror shall provide Attachment A  Past Performance Information as described in L.3.3.1.  The Offerors Reference(s) noted in Attachment A shall provide Attachment B  Past Performance Questionnaire as described in L.3.3.2. <BR><BR><BR>13.	Is it acceptable for Offerors to propose a higher cost than the current funding listed at L.1.1.9?  <BR><BR>Yes, it is acceptable to propose a higher cost than the current funding listed at L.1.1.9.   As stated in the Notes section of L.1.1.9, strict adherence to the funding profile incorporated herein shall not be a consideration in the source selection decision and Offerors are encouraged to develop best-value proposals.  The current funding profile is used as a guideline for Offerors; however, additional POM funding will be requested in addition to the current budget.  <BR><BR><BR>14.	Is it feasible that funding will be made available other than what is listed at L.1.1.9? <BR><BR>The current funding profile is used as a guideline for Offerors; however, unfunded requirements and additional POM funding will be requested in addition to the current budget.  The Government makes no assurances that the projected funds shall be made available for this program nor shall this solicitation provision be the basis for a claim under the contract in the event the projected funds fail to materialize. This provision will not be incorporated in any contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation.  This answer shall be considered part of Section L.  <BR> <BR>

<AWARDEE>Fann Contracting, Inc., 1403 Industrial Way, Prescott, AZ 86301 US
<DESC>PROJECT DETAILS:  The project (AZ PRA GRCA 12(7)) is located at the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. The project extends from about 0.5 miles east and west of Mather Point and south of the existing service road at Canyon View Information Plaza (CVIP).  

This project is for the improvements to the Canyon View Information Plaza and the Mather Point overlook at Grand Canyon National Park.  This is the second phase of work and is the “architectural” side of the proposed improvements.  This phase will require construction of a landmark feature, amphitheater, and restroom, shuttle bus stop (one at Mather Point and two at Park Headquarters) and Mather Point overlook improvements.   The contractor for this project will be required to incorporate boulders and rocks consistent with the total overall theme for the Mather Point area.  

Principle work items include:  Concrete pavement 3,600 square yards; concrete sidewalk 4,000 square yards; asphalt trail 3,000 square yards; roadway excavation 3,000 cubic yards; handrail installation 1,600 linear feet; boulder placement 350 each; rockery features 1,000 cubic yards; stone masonry features 250 square yards.  This project contains one schedule and one option.  The option is for the Mather Point improvements.  

The work includes architectural columns to link the pavilion area and the shuttle bus plaza. The Visitor Center shuttle bus improvements will be built as a special feature since the area is a key component for visitor’s arrival to the area and their overall experience.  The contractor for this project will be required to work with the sculptor in the placement of the stones for both the Landmark Feature and the Amphitheater.    

The Mather Point improvements will consist of reconstruction of the concrete walking stair in its current location and will include new hand railings.  A major element of this construction will be providing an accessible trail that begins on the western edge and ramps down toward the observation point.  Stone walls and railings will be required along the ramp access to the point.

<DESC>Recovery Action.  For Information Purposes Only.  This is notice of the Department of Energy, Golden Field Office award of a time and materials non-competitive task order to RW Beck, Inc., Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) 044599108 located in Seattle, Washington for Independent Engineering Services for integrated biorefinery projects.  This award was made under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules.  Award was made to a large business.  This purchase was accomplished under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541611.  Place of performance is 1801 California Street, Suite 2800, Denver, Colorado 80202. The period of performance is 1/14/2010 thru 9/30/2015.  The task order is for commercial non-personal engineering services and is performance based. The task requirements are: TASK 1 Prepare a report on the state of technology and lessons learned over the period of performance of the contract; TASK  2 Prior to Budget Period 1 assist the COR with project status assessments and preparation of Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) and Cooperative Agreements; TASK 3 During Budget Period 1 provide independent engineer and financial consulting services to DOE; TASK 4 During Budget Period 2 and Budget Period 3 provide independent engineer and financial consulting services to DOE: TASK 5 Monitor for Recovery Act Compliance; TASK 6 Analysis and Review of Integrated Biorefinery Issues; TASK 7 Attend Peer Reviews, Stage Gates, Programmatic Reviews, and Special Topic Meetings; TASK 8 Provide technical advice to DOE on preparation of future funding opportunity announcements. Rational for using other than a competitive approach:  The task order was awarded against Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) DE-EE0001468 which was awarded competitively against General Services Administratons Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services schedule contracts. Only one quote was received and only  one BPA was awarded against GS-10F-0324T. To compete this task order now or award to any other source would not be practical and would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Additionally, services are needed immediately to satisfy mission requirements.  Rational for using other than a Firm Fixed Price approach: A Time & Material contract was utilized because there are several uncertainties involved in the contract that can not be identified and quantified with reasonable estimates.  Sufficient factual information did not exist at the time of award to permit the exclusive use of a Firm Fixed Price contract. Some requirements however, may be Firm Fixed priced to the maximum extent practical. No other contract type authorized by FAR 16.000 is suitable.  This contractual action was justified in accordance with FAR 16.601 Time and Material Contracts.

<DESC>The contract acquired QYT 4 Dell PowerEdge M610 Blade Servers under the Federal Supply Schedule program.  The award was fixed price but was purchased with a brand name restriction on competition thereby limiting competition to the Dell brand.  The Indian Health Service uses Dell PowerEdge for its critical servers in order to provide consistent agency operation, mission, and patient care.  It is imperative that the EHR servers be standardized in order to maintain adequate technical support and maintenance, thereby eliminating potential hardware/software conflicts and the need for additional training.  The Dell supppplied replacement parts and technical support ensures compatabiliity of hardware and minimal down time for agency critical servers.  This allows the end user to have one point of contact for warranty support.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service is planning a sole-source purchase order with the American Indian Health Management and Policy, Inc. (AIHMP). The AIHMP is a 100% American Indian owned healthcare consulting firm. AIHMP was created in 2004 with the purpose of providing a full range of healthcare consulting services to Indian Health Service, tribal health programs and urban Indian programs. The principals of AIHMP have a diverse background including private sector experience, Indian Health Service, tribal and urban Indian health program experience.
<p>The Office of the Area Director is responsible to ensure the Indian Health Hospital located on the Rosebud reservation is providing the services required by the government and utilizing the federal appropriations in accordance to regulations which govern the Indian Health Service. To comply with these requirements, the Area Office would have to increase staff and expenditures to accommodate the increased workload. The most cost effective and efficient alternative is to contract with the AIHMP. Therefore, this is an urgent and compelling need that potentially could result in unacceptable delays to fulfilling the agency's requirements if not satisfied as such.<br /><br />This announcement is a sole-source set-aside, pursuant to FAR 6.302-2. Any questions regarding this announcement can be directed to Donna Harwood, Purchasing Agent, Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service at (605) 226-7332. Closing date of this announcement is February 2, 2010.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALTO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the CAI Frederick, Frederick, MD, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Compensation and Pension Service division. 2.  Nature/Description of Action.This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with AMTIS, Inc., for the procurement of services for:  Customer Satisfaction Survey Cards and Reports. 3.  Description of Supplies/Services.The purpose of this requirement is to continue services with the incumbent who is currently conducting support for the Medical Disability Examination Contract Program for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Compensation and Pension Service division.  The contractor is responsible for receiving and analyzing Veteran and active duty service members' customer service survey cards regarding the quality of the service provided by the medical disability examination contractor.  This task order involves tallying responses to five survey questions and one comment section in which it is clearly identified, if a Veteran/service member wishes to be contacted by VA, a place for a contact information is shown. Veterans' and active duty service members' responses to this survey instrument (cards) shall contain the contractors' (or government) business reply mail permit number and be mailed to the contractor by the Veterans/service members for tabulation and analysis.  In addition, comments received from Veterans/service members that require follow up action by the medical contractor or VA shall be forwarded by email within two business days of receipt. A follow up action is defined as any comment requiring further investigation of a complaint or concern regarding a particular visit and when a Veteran/service member specifically asks to be contacted. AMTIS Inc is currently providing assistance to VA under their existing award.  The estimated value of this requirement to support the Medical Disability Examination project is $361,801.98, $271,351.48 for the base year and $90,450.50 for the four-month option year.4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  The applicable statute is PL 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program.5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.AMTIS Inc has provided VA contractual assistance for the past year in support of the medical disability examination contract customer survey project.  Under their current award AMTIS has exceeded expectation in the assistance of this crucial element of the program. They have also met their milestones and have provided timely delivery of all reports.  AMTIS is a Service Disabled Veteran Woman-Owned Small Business with competencies in an array of disciplines that include management, administration, and technical and instructional services specialists. They have a staff of competent senior-level subject matter experts and professional consultants.  This procurement requires services that AMTIS is already familiar with in regards to VA's mission for the medical disability examination project.  The new procurement requires support of program development and management for the critical area as noted in paragraph 2.  Securing AMTIS to provide continuity from the previous work they provided will ensure that this project will continue to be successful in meeting Veterans' needs.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.This acquisition was not synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the exception granted at FAR 5.202(a)(4).7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on a comparison of the GSA schedule pricing, current contract pricing, and AMTIS's proposal.8.  Description of Market Survey.N/A.  The basis for this sole source is for continuity of services in the medical disability examination contract customer survey project..  In accordance with FAR 6.302-5, a sole source award will be made to AMTIS who is performing work for the VA's transformation initiative under an existing award.9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.None.10.  Listing of Interested Sources.AMTIS Inc, 2431 Aloma Avenue, Suite 300Winter Park, Florida 32792 11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
