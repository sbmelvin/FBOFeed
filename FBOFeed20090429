<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER SUSTAINMENT, RESTORATION &amp; MODERNIZATION ACQUISITION TASK ORDER CONTRACT (SATOC).&nbsp; "In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Government posts this presolicitation notice of intent to issue a task order under an established Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with the Prime Contractors presently assigned to the Sustainment, Restoration &amp; Modernization Acquisition Task Order Contract (SATOC) which is operated by HQ AETC CONS LGCT office, c/o HQ AFCESA CONS CEKC at Tyndall AFB, FL.</p>
<p>Many of the taxiways, aprons, and ramps are devoid of binding asphalt material, leaving large amounts of gravel loose on the surface.&nbsp; This is causing Foreign Object &amp; Debris (FOD) problems.&nbsp; The taxiways are closed to fighter aircraft.&nbsp; Taxiways and aprons are breaking up, making them difficult to maintain and posing a high risk to aircraft tire and engines.&nbsp; A pavement condition index (PCI) condition survey was done in 2007, with an average score of 47 for the aprons and 42 for the taxiways; both results are unsatisfactory.&nbsp; In addition, the pavement is worn down with no grooving remaining, causing a dangerous hydroplaning situation on the runway.</p>
<p>Already under contract is the requirement to mill and overlay the main runway.&nbsp; Season one, of two, for this construction effort is currently scheduled to start mid-July 09 with demobilization occurring in early Nov 09.&nbsp; The SATOC apron/taxiway repair Contractor shall work seamlessly with the main runway repair SATOC Contractor.&nbsp; Any coordination conflicts will be addressed by the COR and the CO as appropriate.</p>
<p>The taxiway and apron airfield repair project, along with the main runway repair project, will bring the entire airfield up to an adequate level of serviceability.</p>

<p>FSPM972505 - MC Construct Range OPS Warehouse, Bldg 1451</p>
<p>THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>The work to be accomplished at Edwards AFB, CA, requests a proposal to construct a new warehouse, identified as Building 1451.&nbsp; The programmed use of the building is for storage of sensitive electronic equipment and supplies used at Ridley Mission Control, B1440.&nbsp; No combustibles will be stored and there will be no human occupancy.</p>
<p>Siting considerations included ease of access to Ridley's loading dock and freight elevator, use of existing pavements, and avoidance of existing buried utilities lines.&nbsp; Its location at the intersection of two distinguished visitor routes will require enhanced exterior design consideration.&nbsp; Associated with Ridley, the new warehouse characteristics should reflect its characteristics:</p>
<p>1) Textured, cement-based, low maintenance wall panels</p>
<p>2) Parapet walls on three sides (SE, SW, &amp; NW)</p>
<p>3) Single slope, reflective metal roof, sloping to the north-east</p>
<p>Size of this pre-engineered building is expected to be approximately 4,000 square-feet with a 60' x 60' footprint.</p>
<p>A fire suppression/detection/reporting system will be required.</p>
<p>HVAC is required only to temper interior climate, avoiding freezing and over-heating.</p>
<p>Existing mature landscaping will have to removed.&nbsp; Existing drainage swales will have to be re-configured.&nbsp; New landscaping and site drainage are included in this project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include storage racks "fixed" to three of four interior perimeter walls.</p>
<p>Include "fixed" vehicle-control gate across adjacent service driveway.</p>

<DESC><p>The Global Systems Positioning (GPS) Wing will release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) on 19 January 2009. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category 1D program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1 and 2. Block 1 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1 capabilities, Block 2 will integrate GPS IIIA capabilities into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, TT&amp;C, on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 37 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Potential Offerors who believe they are technically capable but were not awarded a Phase A contract shall submit a statement of capability within 10 days of the posting of this announcement. Potential Offerors shall indicate whether they are a large or small business and their interest as a prime or subcontractor.</p>
<p>No further notices for this solicitation will be posted. The GPSW will communicate directly with responsible prime contractors deemed capable to provide responsive proposals.</p>

The incumbent's contract ends in December 2009. This RFI inquiry pertains to the follow-on to this effort which will primarily be for SE&amp;I work. A cost reimbursable contract is contemplated. Work under the follow-on contract will commence in January 2010 and continue for approximately 5 years.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is for market research purposes only. Respondents should note that the government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice. The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by respondent's regarding any responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: SE&amp;I and A&amp;AS tasks are shared by the Government Program Office, FFRDCs, the SE&amp;I Contractor, and the Segment Contractors. SE&amp;I tasks includes leading the coordination, guidance and execution of end-to-end systems engineering and integration activities at the systems level across all inter-Segment and external interfaces for requirements development, system testing, interface verification, system deployment, operations, and sustainment. It also includes oversight and insight of systems engineering and integration within system Segments as required to ensure system performance is met. It is expected that the SE&amp;I contractor must be capable of working intimately with all programs in the wing, and have expertise in the ground and space segments of those programs. However, the SE&amp;I contractor must also have the capability to act independently and objectively for the benefit of maintaining SBIRS programs on target with cost, schedule and performance objectives. There are three work locations that will need to be staffed- Sunnyvale, CA, Boulder, CO, and El Segundo, CA. The Program estimates that between 70 and 120 people are needed to provide services in all three locations. The Program also estimates that approx 50 percent of contractor staff will require a TS/SCI security clearance.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 1,000 to 5,000 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located in the Continental United States. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:
On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) and requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria:
Animals that are 11 years of age and older; orAnimals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions.
This may require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. 
Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 1,000 to 5,000 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized.
Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor.
General ServicesThe contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks:  
Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain 1,000 to 5,000 (Based on the offeror's proposal) wild horses grazing in pastures.  The pastures shall be capable of producing sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The pastures must have sufficient rock and soil type to maintain proper hoof size and shape, without trimming.   The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures and shall not be included in carrying capacity determinations; Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis; Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility; Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition; Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment; Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  The results of the each inventory will be included in the monthly invoice.  Maintain a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of these observations;Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  Each death will be recorded by the freeze mark and/or description of the animal, date the animal was noted as dead and then submitted on each months invoice.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI;Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain, as an act of mercy.
Handling and GatheringIn the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups.
All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling.
Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices.
Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather.  The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment.  Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facilities to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment. 
Corral/holding Facility - Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels). It is anticipated that the corrals will be used to receive, hold, gather, ship and prepare horses.  The corrals must be at least 72" high and made of stoutly constructed material i.e. pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  No barbed wire will be allowed in the construction of corrals and any corral constructed of mesh wire (openings no larger than 2 by 4 inches) must be equipped with at least 3 wood sight boards (2 by 8 inches) located on the upper portion of the fence.  The three sight boards shall be spaced no more than 12 inches apart.  Corrals constructed of pipe or wood must have openings of not more than 12 inches between horizontal members.  Corrals and holding areas need to be free of protrusions, and hazards.  Corral gates shall be constructed of wood or pipe the same height as the fences.  Gates shall be visible to the horses either from the materials used in construction or by using materials such as plywood or plastic mesh placed on the gates.  The contractor will furnish a stable area (concrete or gravel) to place a hydraulic squeeze chute provided by the Bureau.  If electricity is unavailable the Bureau will provide a generator to run the hydraulic chute.  Two sorting corrals, each with a minimum of 2,500 square feet, which would be used for holding horses for short term (up to five days prior to shipment). 
Soil types in corrals/pens must be well drained and non-alkaline in nature.  Slopes within the pens shall provide for adequate drainage. 
At least two or more small pastures to maintain approximately 70 wild horses prior to shipment (30 days or more) will be necessary.  These pastures need to be accessible to the working corral, and constructed to have fencing to hold foals if needed during the weaning process.  Fencing must be constructed of small wire mesh, low to the ground to prevent a foal from going under the fencing.   The small pastures, described under (4) above, must have sufficient water for 70 wild horses at a rate of 16 gallons per animal, per day.
Adequate chutes and crowding alleys to facilitate gathering, preparing, and shipping animals.	The runway must have solid sides, have at least three sliding gates, be solidly constructed of steel or lumber, be at least 36' in length, 28-32" wide, and at least 72"tall.
Unloading and Working Facility - The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  Chutes shall have solid sides which restrict the animals vision and will minimize the risk that animals may attempt to jump out of the chute.  Width of the chute must be at least 32 inches.    Fences shall be at a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel.
Fences - Perimeter fences shall be a minimum of 48" in height and completely enclose the facility.  Pasture division fences shall be a minimum of 48" in height.  All pasture fences shall consist of four strands of barbed wire or other acceptable fencing materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, it may be necessary for the contractor to flag certain fences with eight (8) inches of flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence every 20 feet to make the fences more visible to the horses. Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures. 
Pastures - The facility shall have sufficient land and forage to sustain 1,000 to 5,000 (depending on the offeror's proposal) wild horses year round. The pastures must have sufficient rock and soil type to maintain proper hoof size and shape, without trimming. The land must be privately owned by the offeror or the offeror must have long term control of the offered lands.  Offered lands cannot include public lands, BLM wild horse and burro herd areas, herd management areas or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territories.  If any public lands, are within the privately owned or controlled land, the public lands must be fenced out and will not be used in the calculation of the stocking rate.  The private lands must be at least 10 miles from any BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Area, Herd Area and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to verify that offered lands meet this requirement. Information on the location of BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Areas, Herd Areas and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory can be obtained by the Forest Service office or, for BLM land, by the BLM local office or the Wild Horse and Burro web site (www.wildhorseandburro.blm.gov.)  Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.  Pastures shall be free of hazards such as unfenced paved public highways.  If pastures are noncontiguous, they shall be managed as separate units, (no more than four units) each with a corral facility.  Horses shall not be moved from one unit to another except under extraordinary conditions and with the permission of the COR and/or PI.  The maximum allowable driving distance between all units combined shall be no greater than fifty (50) miles.
Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality or removal, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable.
The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition yearlong, with supplemental feeding as described below.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body.  
The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above.
Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures.
Vegetation monitoring will be done by qualified personnel.  If vegetation utilization exceeds the moderate level, changes may need to be made so land health standards are maintained.
Supplemental Feed - Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses when natural forage nutritional value is low.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, and mold.  Feed will be required daily for animals maintained in the corral areas, and supplemental feed will be required for pastured animals only during times when natural forage will not maintain the animals in good condition.  For example this could be during the winter months when the forage nutritional value is low.
Horses maintained in corrals shall be fed hay in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.   Hay used shall have a protein content of 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, and free of dust, mold and weeds or grasses deemed unhealthy forage for wild horses. 
Feed Requirements - A good quality grass, grass/legume mix or legume hay shall be fed to and made available in sufficient quantity for each animal, with a crude protein not less than 12 percent.  While the animals are in the corral areas, they shall be fed at least 2.5 percent of body weight per day.  The COR may test supplement or hay to verify its quality. 
Inclement weather will stress animals, requiring that the volume of feed be increased to maintain their body flesh.
Water, Minerals, and SaltEach pasture shall have reliable water sources capable of supplying 16 gallons of clean water per horse, per day.  The maximum distance to water in any pasture shall be 4 miles.
Granulated, rock, or block salt shall be accessible to all horses in each pasture.
Minerals necessary to maintain the horses in good condition and that are deficient in the available forage in the care unit shall be provided to all horses in each pasture, either as a supplement or added to the salt.
Observation of Horses - The wild horses shall be observed by the contractor at a minimum of one (1) time per week, to determine the overall condition of the animals, and any deaths.  Observation will be conducted  more frequently when conditions warrant, i.e., during flooding, tornados, and the fire seasons, to ascertain their safety and well being and assure that fences are properly maintained.  Except in emergency situations, observations shall be carried out on foot, from a vehicle, or horseback.  In unusual situations, such as deep snow, etc., which make ground transportation impractical, aircraft may be used, with the prior approval of the COR and/or PI.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  Records that document, as a minimum, the date of the observation, number and condition of the horses, problems and concerns of the observer, and the name(s) of individual(s) making the observation shall be maintained.  Any problems or concerns shall be reported to the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of discovery.
Access to the Facility - Access to the unloading and loading chute shall accommodate both trucks with stock trailers and semi-trucks.  Access shall be available during inclement weather.
Observation for the Public - The site is not intended to be a public viewing area.  Therefore, the contractor will restrict or prohibit access onto the site by the general public.
The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of any request from humane organizations, general public, media or wild horse interest groups, to observe the horses.  All such organizations and groups may be allowed to tour the site only under the approval and guidance of the COR and/or PI.
All requests to view the animals shall be directed to the COR and/or PI.
This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation L09PS000367, which will ONLY be available at http://www.fedconnect.net on or about May 6, 2009. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>L09PS00432, FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA HOLDING FACILITY, FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH TWO 12-MONTH OPTIONS.  Solicitation number L09PS00432 applies and will be issued on or about May 4, 2009 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement:  The Bureau of Land Management's Elm Creek, NE Holding Facility has a requirement for feeding services 7 days per week for 12 months, from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, with an option for 2 more 12-month periods. The Elm Creek Wild Horse and Burro Facility is located at 5050 100th Road, Elm Creek, Nebraska. Offerors shall provide a firm fixed monthly unit price for the base year, option year 1 and option year 2. BACKGROUND - Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 US. 1331-1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in facilities for preparation to be placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program. The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek (EC) is the primary holding facility for wild horses and burros making their way to private homes across the United States through the Adopt-A- Horse program.  Routinely, EC receives animals from western facilities and conversely ships them to adoption locations around the midwest, southern, and eastern United States. The facility maintains throughout the year 400-500 animals on a daily basis. OBJECTIVE - The objective of this contract is to procure services for the feeding of these animals as they arrive from the western facilities and await transport to adoption locations around the country. EC is a permanent year-round holding facility requiring daily feeding of the animals residing on the facility. GENERAL SERVICES - The Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel and equipment to assure the daily feeding on average of 400-500 animals 365 days a year, to include all unloading of large round bale hay shipments that arrive at EC from the hay contractor, which is expected to be about once a month. Shipments may occur more than once a month, depending on the number of animals being maintained at the facility, animal, and weather conditions. Approximately 195 tons of hay will be shipped per month, and shipments will include large round bales and small square bales. Contractor Furnished Equipment Required: As a minimum, the contractor will provide a tractor or loader with a round-bale grapple loader capable of transporting round bales to the necessary feeders on the facility.  The tractor will be required to have front assist capability because of the steep grades and slippery conditions during wet times. Conditions at the facility can become very slippery and this requirement is necessary for the safety of the contract employees, as well as, the facility fences and ability to get hay to the animals. The contractor provided tractor will remain on the facility 7 days a week to ensure that in the case of bad weather the tractor will be available to the facility to feed horses and not need to be transported to the facility in poor weather conditions. On occasion, with the approval of the COR, the tractor may leave the premises for maintenance or fueling. Optional Contractor Furnished Equipment: A pickup truck to deliver small square bales to the required feeders is optional but recommended due to the ease of driving next to the feeders and delivering the small square bales to the feeders. The facility consists of 9 large outside pens and 21 smaller pens. The outside pens are used to house the majority of the animals and can house 50-80 animals per pen. The outside pens have movable, large round-bale feeders. The smaller inside pens consist of 10 pens used for animals being ready for shipment or adoption events. Five of the smaller pens are used for BLM saddle horses or animals requiring special attention. The smaller pens have hanging feeders requiring the use of small square bales and several have round-bale feeders which can be used. There are also 6 isolation pens used to house sick or injured animals and have permanent feeders requiring the feeding of small square bales. It is anticipated that the feeding services for the wild horses and burros will require at least two contract personnel, one to operate the front-end loader tractor and one to operate the pickup on a daily basis, and a second person to open and close gates. The contract personnel will be required to unload all shipments of the large round bales of hay that arrive at the facility, and to haul the large round-bales using the contractor-provided tractor/loader to the large outside pens from a central holding area. In addition, the contractors will need to haul small square bales from a central storage area to the small pens using the contractor provided pickup truck or tractor/loader. It is anticipated that one contractor employee would drive the vehicles and the other would open gates and off-load the small square bales into the feeders. As for the unloading of the shipments of the round bales of hay delivered by the hay contractor, it is anticipated that the contractor will need to provide a tractor operator for the contractor provided tractor. The feeding contractor, the hay contractor, and the BLM COR shall coordinate all delivery times to ensure that hay is delivered and unloaded in a timely and efficient manner. The safety and well-being of the Contractor's personnel performing these feeding services shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. The behavior/conduct of the Contractor's personnel shall be the full responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall be held accountable for any employee's misconduct, negligence, and/or failure to perform. The Contractor's personnel shall have a working knowledge of feeding large numbers of animals in a feedlot environment. In the event that any one or more contractor personnel are observed performing the required duties in an unsafe manner to the animals, themselves, Government personnel, or endangering the Government Furnished equipment/supplies, the contractor shall be so notified by the COR or PI and the contractor shall provide an immediate replacement person at the facility within two hours of being notified. In as much as the facility is open to the public, the Contractor's employees will perform their duties in a manner that will not bring discredit on the BLM or the contractor.  Further, operation of equipment will take into consideration that members of the public may be in the area and utmost caution will be taken. The Contractor and personnel are responsible for any malicious damage or accidental damage of the Government furnished equipment. On a daily basis, prior to operating any item of equipment, the contractors personnel will perform an inspection of the vehicles/equipment to include but not be limited to fluid levels, operation of safety equipment, etc. This is not a complete list of the specifications and should be used only as a basis to decide whether or not to review the solicitation. The complete solicitation will be available ONLY at http://www.fedconnect.net.  Proposals are due June 8, 2009 by 2:00 PM Mountain Time.  Send proposals by U.S. Mail to:  Department of the Interior; BLM, BC-663; Attention: Steve Santoro; BLDG 50, DFC, PO Box 25047; Denver, CO  80225-0047.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Quotation for a firm fixed-price purchase order for the assessment of impacts of spawning gravel additions on geomorphology and spawning habitat in Clear Creek. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the related small business size standard is $7 Million.  This procurement is set-aside for Small Business concerns only.
Solicitation 09SQ200075 will be posted to http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about April 30, 2009. The date for receipt of proposals will be approximately May 15, 2009. The solicitation must be downloaded at the above website; no paper copy of this solicitation will be distributed. Prospective contractors MUST be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award. Questions concerning this solicitation should be directed to bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov. 
 The requirement consists of the following items:   
Task 1 - Project Management - The contractor shall a) send one or two representatives, as requested and needed, to monthly Clear Creek Team meetings to serve as technical experts in geomorphic matters related to project design and monitoring.  Meetings usually held in either Anderson or Redding, California.  b) prepare monthly progress reports describing status of each task contained in this contract.    c) meet with the contracting officer's technical representative up to 6 times per year to discuss status and progress of work.  
Task 2 - Aerial Photographs - The contractor shall conduct an aerial flight of Clear Creek from Whiskeytown Dam to the Sacramento River confluence.  The portion from the Sacramento River to Clear Creek Road Bridge will be ortho-photos, while the reach from Clear Creek Road Bridge to Whiskeytown Dam will not be ortho-photos but will be rubbersheeted to fit the LiDAR and existing topography.  Exact specifications shall be determined by Reclamation and the contractor after review of potential costs.  Photographs shall include the entire project footprint for the Channel Restoration Project including Phases 1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, Reading Bar, and all borrow areas.  
Task 3 - Conduct a Longitudinal Profile - The contractor shall conduct a longitudinal profile from Whiskeytown Dam to the confluence with the Sacramento River.  Data collected shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, streambed elevation, water surface elevation.  Profile shall be constructed with shots taken approximately every 30 feet between the dam and the confluence.  Profile shall also include locations of all past, active, and known future spawning gravel injection sites.  
Task 4 - Monitor Topography Below Injection Sites - Contractor shall conduct two (2) in-stream topographic surveys at, and downstream, of each of the following gravel injection locations: Whiskeytown Dam, Below Dog Gulch, Above Peltier Valley Bridge, Paige Bar, Above NEED Camp, Below NEED Camp, Placer Road Bridge, Clear Creek Road Bridge, Reading Bar, Below Saeltzer Dam (City of Redding), Phase 3A and Phase 2A.  Surveys shall be conducted during the summer, following the rainy season, only if flows of sufficient magnitude occurred to move gravel at injection locations. Topographic surveys shall document downstream movement of spawning gravel.  Surveys should extend downstream to capture gravel's leading edge.  For in-stream and lateral berm injection sites contractor shall survey, if feasible, topography of the gravel injection prior to its movement by high flows.  
Task 5 - Map Redd Location Versus Potential Spawning Habitat - Obtain GIS database(s) of Chinook salmon and steelhead redd locations and potential spawning habitat maps/data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Red Bluff.  Using a GIS database and the aerial images produced in task 2, produce three sets of maps showing redd locations, potential spawning habitat, and maps combining redd locations and potential spawning habitat for the reach between Whiskeytown Dam and the confluence with the Sacramento River.  
Task 6 - Potential Spawning Habitat Change Over Time - Assess and quantify, to the greatest extent possible, changes in the amount of potential spawning habitat located between Whiskeytown Dam and the confluence with the Sacramento River.  Analysis will use all available historic information, including reports/memos from 1954, 1970, 2001 and the 2009 dataset produced in task 5.  
Task 7 - Gravel Transport Calculations and Analysis - Calculate sediment transport rates at the bottom of reach 1 (near NEED Camp) and reach 2 (near Clear Creek Road Bridge).  Data collected shall be used to refine gravel augmentation strategy as presented in the 2006 Update to the Clear Creek Gravel Management Plan.  Contractor shall secure access to sampling sites such that data can be collected at their own discretion, volition and frequency.  
Task 8 - Compare Talus, Lateral Berm, Channel Relocation Restoration, and Instream Methods of Spawning Gravel Injection Methods.  Review available information relating to Central Valley Projects, focusing on Clear Creek if possible, regarding:  spawning gravel injection projects, spawning gravel movement, potential habitat created, and use of potential spawning habitat by spawning anadromous fish.  Where data is available, compare the types of spawning gravel injection methods to determine the following: 1) rate of gravel entrainment, 2) amount of potential spawning habitat created by projects, 3) cost per ton of gravel placed, 4) cost per unit (e.g., square foot) of potential spawning habitat created.  Analysis should focus on determining cost/benefit relationship between various injection methods and locations.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with each State or Territory, as an independent entity, to provide required data for the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) of the National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Data will be purchased from all States, New York City (NYC), District of Columbia (DC), and five U.S. Territories. In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 242k, Section 306(h) of the Public Health Service Act, NCHS has a legislatively-mandated mission to produce national vital statistics based on annually collected data from the nation's birth, death, and fetal death records. The NVSS is a cooperative, decentralized system in which data from over 6 million vital events records are collected each year by all States, NYC, DC, and five U.S. Territories and sent to NCHS for processing and dissemination. The records are State owned, governed by State laws and regulations, and produced through State operated registration systems. This highly specialized data is available from no other source than the identified State or Territory. Each registration area has, by law, the exclusive authority to collect and record the events, and currently do so as a governmental function. No state possesses legal or regulatory authority within another state's jurisdiction. As the sole entity authorized to and engaged in the collection of birth and death information, each state agency is uniquely and solely capable of providing the requisite data to the Government. The NAICS Code is 519190. Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this notice or by submitting a proposal. This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals. It is believed that data procured from the individual States or Territories meet the minimum needs of the Government and no other source for these services is known at this time. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.320-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies are services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Information furnished shall include enough detail information to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation. Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results. Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date. If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non-responsive. Note 22 applies to this announcement. Inquiries may be sent to the attention of the Contract Specialist: Natasha Y. Rowland, Phone 770-488-2601, email nrowland@cdc.gov. If the Contract Specialist isn't available, please call the Team Leader, Vivian S. Hubbs, Phone 770-488-2647.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract to evaluate hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity among US-born adolescents who received hepatitis B primary vaccination series during early childhood. Vaccination against hepatitis B (HB) starting at birth is safe and highly effective in preventing chronic HBV infection. Studies of children vaccinated with plasma-derived vaccines, available since the early 1980s, have shown protection from the vaccine to last at least 20 years. A number of investigators believe this immunity may be life-long, but actual determination of duration and magnitude of this immunity, including in persons who do not respond well to vaccination, can only be determined as current cohorts of adolescents who were immunized as infants enter periods of higher risk for HBV infection. Since the late 1980s, recombinant HB vaccines have gradually replaced plasma-derived vaccines such that within the next few years, plasma-derived vaccine will have been almost completely phased out globally. Routine use of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been widely implemented only in the last 15 years or so, and as a result there are limited data on long-term protection among those vaccinated beginning at birth in countries of low HBV endemicity. Therefore, the major tasks to be completed under this contract include:<br />1) To evaluate lasting immunity against hepatitis B provided by vaccination received during early childhood (i.e., all 3 vaccine series should have been received within the first 9 months of life)<br />2) To evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing HBV infection by testing for relevant serologic markers.<br />3) To evaluate whether natural boosting from exposures to HBV has an impact on the duration of hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity by analyzing anamnestic response among Whites vs. Blacks.<br />4) To identify potential risk factors associated with failure to respond to a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine<br />The CDC anticipates a period of performance of two years. This is not a Request for Proposal. The intention of this notice is to notify potential offerors that Solicitation No. 2009-N-11287 will be available for download on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before May 15, 2009. This will be a full and open competition. Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. All questions must be submitted in writing to Sharon Cunningham at Sharon.Cunningham@cdc.gov orJulio Lopez at Julio.Lopez@cdc.gov. All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov. No telephone calls will be accepted. It is the sole responsibility of the offeror to continually view the website for any amendments made to this notice.</p>

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation.<BR><BR>The Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of NetWork Appliance Hardware & Software. The use of Network Appliance, Inc brand-name is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure requirements, and continuity of current operations, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. ... Network Appliance provides hardware and software for the data storage infrasturcture of the Gobal Financial Services Center. This hardware and software provides a high availability storage environment for the core production financial applications, office productivity applications, and electronic messaging services for the GFSC Continuity of Operations Plan facility located in the D.C. metro area. The mission critical nature of this hardware and software requires periodic incremental upgrades of hardware and software to preserve the performance characteristics of these applications under increased user and data volumes. Components of the hardware and all of the software for this platform are the intellectual property of NetApps, and are therefore not available from another commercial vendor. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2). The regulatory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(2),FAR 6.302-, Unusual and compelling urgency. This is a brand name justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's Regional Financial Management System.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The successful offeror shall perform mathematical analysis on a variety of engineering and natural resource management projects.  The successful offeror shall analyze provided data and create statistical analysis to support the project goals.  The goals can be, but are not limited to, probability, design for experiments, spatial statistical analysis, multivariable analysis, etc.
The types and breadth of upcoming analysis needs are not fully known.  However, the following information is provided to indicate the type of work that has been accomplished in the past as well as some future needs.
	Multi-variable analysis on the probability and prediction of fire ignitions from muzzle loaded guns.
	Airtanker drop pattern analysis.  The Forest Service has collected a significant amount of retardant drop pattern information.  Additionally, the Forest Service has either caused or supported the development of several prediction drop pattern tools.  The Forest Service has implemented a rudimentary replication process where the controllable parameters are attempted to be identical to produce the same ground pattern.  We are seeking a multi-variable analysis of our data and models to indicate the reproducibility of a single pattern and determine the number of replicate drops necessary to capture a two/three sigma variation on the ground patterns.
	The Forest Service will be testing a new fire retardant delivery drop system.  The concept is outside of our prior implementations.  The system drops boxes with a bladder inside that contains the retardant.  The Forest Service needs an analysis to determine the probability or reliability prediction of opening on the concept.
	The Forest Service performs testing on a number of products used in natural resource protection (e.g. fire tools, cargo nets, and fire hose).  We have developed and implemented several tests to assure the proper design and manufacture of these products. A statistical analysis of our processes for testing is needed to assure that our results represent the quality of the product under test.  For example, fire hose is selected based on standard quality sampling procedure.  A segment of the hose is then peel-tested for adhesion of the water way to the outer fiber.  The analysis of our testing process needs to determine the number of samples appropriate to assure the quality of the hose being supplied to the agency.

This soliicitation will be a cascading set-aside with a preference for HUB Zone Businesses , then  Veteran-owned Service-disabled Businesses and the last tier preference being Small Businesses. 
The solicitation will be available on FEDBIZOPPS on or about May 14, 2009.

<DESC><p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST - SUBSURFACE GROUT STABILIZATION OF SPECIFIC WASTE TARGETS LOCATED AT THE RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPLEX AT THE RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT COMPLEX AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY </strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site located approximately 50 miles west of Idaho Falls, Idaho. CWI is requesting an expression of interest (EOI) from prospective Vendors or Consortiums to provide equipment and services to perform subsurface grouting of waste located at the INL. This expression of interest shall serve only as a method of establishing technical capabilities and commercial interest. Only those companies that respond by providing evidence of having performed similar activities will be considered. Previous DOE experience is favorable. Evidence of a qualified work force, regularly engaged in the trades required to complete such work, is required. Qualified candidates may be invited to participate in follow-on technical or business discussions which may include on-site visit(s) from CWI technical staff to examine drilling/grouting hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The INL is located in southeastern Idaho and occupies 890 mi<sup>2</sup> on the northeastern region of the Snake River Plain. Within the boundary of the INL, the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) was created in 1952 for the disposal of radioactive waste. Waste was disposed of in pits and trenches. Historically, waste containing radioactive and hazardous substances was managed in accordance with laws and disposal practices current at that time. Present day operations involve the remediation of these sites. The waste targets associated with this EOI are located in the RWMC's Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA). The treatment area comprises up to 20 discrete disposal locations (totaling approximately 0.2 acres) in SDA trenches and soil vault rows. Treatment will be performed via pressure grouting utilizing a preferred cement based grout formulation. The work scope includes furnishing all necessary facilities, equipment, labor, materials, operating documentation, supplies, and tools to perform all operations necessary to emplace the selected grout. Chemically, and/or radiologically contaminated soil and debris may be encountered during the remedial action activities. The subcontractor will be required to integrate their work with Contractor facility operations and oversight and monitoring organizations (e.g., Safety, Industrial Hygiene, or RadCon personnel monitoring and material sampling, etc.). Work will be performed in compliance with the applicable sections of 29&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;1910, 29&nbsp;CFR&nbsp;1926, and the CWI Subcontract Requirements Manual. Involvement with small business firms is recommended and all work must be performed under the requirements of the Davis Bacon Act. Additional information </span></p>

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Yerevan, Armenia, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) from qualified organizations interested in implementing a technical assistance program to support Pension and Labor Market Reform (PALM) program in Armenia. 
USAID plans a single award for 3-year cost plus fixed fee, completion type contract with a total estimated cost in the range of $5 to $6 million for the implementation of this activity. To achieve this, the PALM program will target two key social protection areas: (i) pension reform implementation  build the Government of Armenia (GOAM) institutional and human resource capacity to implement a multi-pillar pension system that will provide an adequate income for its elderly population in an environment that is fiscally sound and sustainable, with reformed current pay-as-you-go (PAYG) scheme and the newly created private retirement savings system; and (ii) labor market interventions  help the GOAM and the most vulnerable individuals to mitigate the economic and social consequences of the global economic crisis by assisting the government and the private sector to: 1) give greater attention to countering the effects of the economic downturn which significantly affected the already inefficient Armenian labor market, 2) catalyze new linkages at the local level between the private sector, local authorities, and vocational training institutions to address labor market gaps, and 3) improve the countrys workforce.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Deborah A. Fournier, Contracting Officer, Phone (617) 565-5970, Fax (617) 565-5967, Email deborah.fournier@gsa.gov
<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE: This requirement is for the procurement of a qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the construction of a new Land Port of Entry in Calais, Maine. This project may include options, which will be evaluated as part of the award. Work includes but is not limited to site preparation, grading and paving; coordination of utility relocation; coordination of storm water management equipment, construction/coordination of multiple inspection booths and canopies; construction of approximately 60,000 GSF of new structures, including office/admin, violator detainment, shooting range, small laboratory, staff parking and warehouse spaces. The project will require coordination with the work of MDOT contractors at both the connection to the new International bridge and Route 1 connector road on opposite ends of the site.  This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is approximately 18 months.  The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on large cold climate construction projects. GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: Large cold-climate construction projects requiring the coordination of site work and blasting, paving and new construction of approximately $10 million dollars or more.  This project is designed using metric units and the magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $50,000,000. Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and, whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach, subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.
The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range established in Phase 3. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing
Large construction projects in cold climate environments.
3 Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan and small business category goals.

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220 Size standard is $31.0 million. This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

<p>Statement of Requirements - Computer Assisted Legal Research Subscription</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Organization</p>
<p>1.1.1 Identification. Air Force Legal Operations Agency, Legal Information Services (AFLOA/JAS), 51 Maxwell Blvd., Bldg. 678, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6418.</p>
<p>1.1.2 Mission: The mission of JAS is to provide a broad range of computer and software products to the AF and DoD legal communities. JAS conducts and mentors legal research, facilitates web site hosting, provides training in research and web site management, provides expertise in procuring data, hardware and software, produces deployment products, develops justice and claims management programs, and is a center of excellence for innovation and initiatives in the legal information technology field. Additionally, JAS is the information technology office for the Air Force Judge Advocate General Corps and the Executive Agent for legal research for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Objective</p>
<p>As DoD Executive Agent, AFLOA/JAS provides computer-assisted research capability, both through its own Federal Legal Information Through Electronics (FLITE) system and through commercial database subscriptions. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain online legal information sources; an interface between Government systems and the vendor databases for access, issuing user IDs and customized database usage reports; and related customer support services for the Air Force, Army and Marine legal communities, mainly training in and telephone help desk support for use of the databases. The primary requirement is for commercial items, mainly the legal information subscriptions and databases; the services are in support of the commodities. See the separate file named "AF_Report.PDF", in Appendix 5, for information on the amounts and types of commercial research activities performed during the year ending 31 December 2008 under the current Air Force contract. Information is provided by type of activity (e.g., search, citator query), database grouping, organization, and User Grouping (i.e., AF Legal [labeled "All MAJCOMs"], NonAF, and SAF/GC). Under the current contract, the AF Legal, Army Legal and SAF/GC groups have access to the All Data Bases Menu, Discounted Transaction- Priced Databases, and All Other Transaction-Priced Databases while the NonAF group only has access to the Legal Menu. Similar information on research activity for the Army and Marines is provided in Appendices 9 and 13, respectively. The Government does not represent that future research activity will remain the same.</p>

<p>2.2.1 Menu Structure</p>
<p>Give users access to all databases that their Specialized User Grouping is authorized to access by means of one hierarchical set of menus, with the databases organized by the Contractor's normal subject categories. When a user connects to the Contractor's system, the Menu appropriate to that user's access authority shall be displayed automatically. The user shall have the capability to navigate among the authorized database menus within a single online session or web browser session.</p>
<p>The Menus shall indicate to the users which databases are subject to transaction pricing so that they can make informed decisions. This objective may be accomplished by placing a $ symbol before the database names or by other display attributes that clearly identify them as being subject to additional charges.<br /><br />2.2.2 Access Methods</p>
<p>Provide access to the specialized file groupings described in Sec. 2.1.1 above in accordance with the requirements as described below.</p>
<p>2.2.2.1 Direct Via Web Browser. Provide access through the Internet using a standard Web browser to all of the contractor's databases that are accessible online.</p>
<p>2.2.2.2 Access through the FLITE Web Server for Air Force Legal, SAF/GC, and NonAF.</p>
<p>(a) Provide access through the Web Server that hosts the Federal Legal Information Through Electronics (FLITE) system. Users already authenticated by the FLITE system shall not be required to enter a Contractor User ID and password ("transparent" or "pass-through" access). The https transaction from the user will contain "af", the FLITE User IDs, and an encrypted hash code. The encryption algorithm will be provided to the contractor after award. The Contractor shall use the FLITE User IDs to determine the user's identity, provide access to the menu authorized for that user, and allocate usage to the user in the reports discussed in Section 2.6.1. Note that the Air Force will provide user information, including FLITE User IDs, in accordance with Section 2.5.1) Users shall have the same capability of setting search and display options as when authenticating directly to the Contractor's Web-based system independently of the FLITE system.</p>
<p>This access shall include the following capabilities, all without requiring the user to enter a User ID and password to the Contractor's system:</p>
<p>(1) When a FLITE user selects the appropriate link in a FLITE Web page, the user will be presented with the top-level menu of the Contractor's system.<br /><br />(2) When a FLITE user selects the appropriate link in a FLITE Web page, the Contractor's system will accept the parameters required to display a particular legal document or to display citator and case history information for a particular legal document. <br /><br />(3) When a FLITE user selects the appropriate link in a FLITE Web page, the Contractor's system will accept the parameters required to display the Contractor's Web search form with a particular source (database) already selected, ready for the user to enter and execute a query. Where there is a choice of search forms, the Contractor's system will accept the appropriate selection parameter.</p>
<p>(4) When a FLITE user has already selected a valid Contractor database and entered a search query in a FLITE Web form, the Contractor's system will accept the parameters required to connect to Contractor's system, execute the query in the selected database, select a display format (results list, list with search terms highlighted, and complete documents) and return the research results.<br /><br />(5) When a FLITE user enters a multi-engine query using Open Text Query Server and includes the Contractor's system as one of the engines queried, hyperlinked search results will be sent from the Contractor's system via the Open Text Query Server to the user along with the results from other engines queried.</p>
<p>(6) When the user clicks on any of the returned links, the Contractor's system will display the linked document along with buttons and/or links to permit the user to navigate through the rest of the results (from the Contractor's system) and to access other search system functions.</p>
<p>(b) Provide the technical information related to its Web-based system required by JAS to implement the types of retrievals described above as well as a technical point of contact. Such information will include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), command syntax, and parameters. The Contractor shall have no responsibility for the FLITE application itself.</p>
<p>(c) Whenever the Contractor modifies its production Web system in a way that affects the capabilities described in Paragraphs (a)(1) - (5) above, it shall do so in a manner that supports these capabilities. At least 30 days before the modification goes into production, the contractor shall provide to JAS any technical information necessary for the FLITE application to continue these capabilities.</p>
<p>(d) Test changes to its system to assure that the functionality of the access through the FLITE Web server is not impaired or diminished.</p>
<p>(e) Document the method used to provide access to its system through the FLITE web server in order to facilitate maintenance and support and provide a copy of this documentation to the JAS Primary POC.</p>
<p>2.2.2.3 Access through JAGCNet for Army Legal.</p>
<p>(a) Provide access through the Web Server that hosts the U. S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps legal information technology and knowledge management portal (JAGCNet). Users already authenticated by the JAGCNet system shall not be required to enter a Contractor User ID and password. The Contractor shall ensure that each user's access is uniquely authenticated in order to determine the identity of the user, provide access to the menu authorized for that user, and allocate usage to the user in the reports discussed in Section 2.6.2. Users shall have the same capability of setting search and display options as when authenticating directly to the Contractor's Web-based system independently of JAGCNet. When a JAGCNet user selects the appropriate link in a JAGCNet Web page, the user will be presented with the top-level menu of the Contractor's system. The Contractor shall provide to the Army technical POC (see 5.1.4), the technical information related to its Web-based system required by the Army to implement this access including Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), command syntax, and parameters.</p>
<p>(b) Whenever the Contractor modifies its production Web system in a way that affects the capabilities described in this Section, it shall do so in a manner that supports these capabilities. At least 15 days before the modification goes into production, the contractor shall provide to the Army technical POC any technical information necessary for the JAGCNet application to continue these capabilities.</p>
<p>(c) Test changes to its system to assure that the functionality of the access through the JAGCNet is not impaired or diminished.</p>
<p>(d) Document the method used to provide access to its system through the JAGCNet web server in order to facilitate maintenance and support and provide a copy to the Army technical POC (see 5.1.4) at least 30 days before performance begins (see 6.0).</p>
<p><br />2.2.2.5 USMC access.</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall provide the ability to access databases directly via a web browser and via standard Web browser software through Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) Web interface.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor also shall provide access through the USAF FLITE system as described above in 2.2.2.2 for USMC users. USMC users already authenticated by the FLITE system shall not be required to enter a Contractor User ID and password. The Contractor shall use the USMC User IDs in order to determine the identity of the user, provide access to the menu authorized for that user, and allocate usage to the user in the reports discussed in Section 2.6.3. Users shall have the same capability of setting search and display options as when authenticating directly to the Contractor's Web-based system independently of FLITE. When a USMC user selects the appropriate link in a FLITE Web page, the user will be presented with the top-level menu of the Contractor's system.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall provide to the USMC technical POC (see 5.1.4) the technical information related to its Web-based system required to implement the types of retrievals described above as well as a technical point of contact. Such information will include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), command syntax, and parameters. Whenever the Contractor modifies its production Web system in a way that affects the capabilities described above, it shall do so in a manner that supports USMC access and shall provide to the USMC technical POC, at least 45 days in advance of the date the modification goes into production, any technical information necessary to continue these capabilities. The Contractor shall test changes to its system to assure that functionality of access is not impaired or diminished.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Search and Retrieval Capabilities</p>
<p>2.2.3.1 Retrieving Documents by Citation</p>
<p>Many of the databases specified in Section 2.1.1 are made up of documents, each with one or more standard forms of citation (e.g. 480 U.S. 102, Revenue Ruling 88-1, 5 United States Code 1). For such databases, the system shall allow the user to select directly a document for browsing and/or retrieval by specifying the document according to the citation form prescribed in the most recent edition of The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation; or according to any additional or different citation form required or recognized by the relevant court, agency, forum or jurisdiction.</p>
<p>2.2.3.2 Searching. The system shall provide the following minimum set of database search facilities:</p>
<p>(a) Boolean search operators equivalent to AND, OR, and AND_NOT.</p>
<p>(b) Proximity search operators that express the nearness of two search terms.</p>
<p>(c) Both infix (e.g., m*n is equivalent to man OR men) and postfix (e.g., litiga*** is equivalent to litigant or litigate) wildcard characters in search terms.</p>
<p>(d) The ability to restrict a search to a specified document segment/field (e.g., court, judge, opinion date, case name, or opinion in a database of court opinion documents).</p>
<p>(e) The ability to recall to the screen the previous search expression entered by the user, modify the expression, and execute the modified search expression, or base a search on the result of a prior search.</p>
<p>2.2.3.3 Browsing. The system shall provide the following minimum set of document browsing facilities:</p>
<p>(a) The ability to display a single document retrieved by citation.</p>
<p>(b) The ability to display a single document from the set of documents returned in response to a search request with each occurrence of each term used in the search request highlighted for easy identification.</p>
<p>(c) The ability to page forward or backward through a single displayed document one screen at a time.</p>
<p>(d) The ability to move forward or backward through a single displayed document viewing only those screens that contain highlighted terms. If this facility is provided through an abbreviated keyword in context display, the system must display at least 20 words on either side of a highlighted term.</p>
<p>(e) The ability to display the document titles for the documents in a search result set (i.e., display a citation list)</p>
<p>2.2.3.4 Citators</p>
<p>(a) The system shall provide at least two different types of citator facilities. At a minimum, both the case history citator and the general citator facilities described below shall be provided for all Federal court opinion databases.</p>
<p>(1) A case history citator shall provide case history, through the various appellate levels, on a case-by-case basis. The case history citator shall be updated on a daily basis so the most recent appellate action for each active case is available.</p>
<p>(2) A general citator shall provide a more in-depth treatment of each case/opinion than the case history citator. The general citator shall include a comprehensive list of references to each case/decision in other court opinions, law reviews, and other applicable publications. For referencing documents that are presented in a volume/page format (e.g., 315 U.S. 649), the page number on which the primary reference occurs must be presented (e.g., 315 U.S. 649 at page 656 or 315 U.S. 656).</p>
<p>(b) For both citators, the system shall allow the user to request a citator/case history display for a single displayed court decision or to enter the citation of the desired decision. When a citator/case history is displayed, the system shall be capable of presenting the full text of a referencing document included on the display, if that document is available in a database provided by the Contractor.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor's system shall provide both citators for all non-Federal court opinion databases for which it currently provided citators to other Federal agencies. List these databases in Exhibit C.</p>
<p>2.2.3.5 Printing, Downloading and E-mail: The system shall provide the following capabilities and facilities:</p>
<p>(a) The ability to download and print, as a single operation, one or more selected documents to a printer connected (either directly or as a shared network device) to the user's workstation.</p>
<p>(b) The ability to download one or more selected documents to the user's workstation and store the documents in a user-specified disk file for later printing or manipulation through a word processing program.</p>
<p>(c) Unlimited printing and downloading of retrieved documents at no additional charge, including all available PDF formats, subject to copyright and licensing restrictions in the final contract. Downloading formats shall, at a minimum, include Microsoft Word and ASCII text.</p>
<p>(d) The ability to e-mail the following to one or more users (subject to any limitations of the user's and recipient's e-mail systems): One or more selected documents, as a single operation; multiple lists of search results; links to selected documents; and citator results.</p>
<p>2.2.3.6 Automatic Search and Retrieval: Provide an Electronic Clipping Service, as defined in Appendix 1, at no additional charge.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Availability</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor's web-based legal research system shall normally be available to all users around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year. "Available" is defined as the system allowing any authorized user to log onto the Contractor's system, search any database file(s), and retrieve and download the requested information." The system shall be available, on a monthly basis, so that system downtime is no greater than five (5) hours of the required period of system availability per month. "System downtime" is that period of time when the system is not fully available to authorized users due to a malfunction or limitations in the Contractor's equipment, software, or telecommunications connections. Lack of system availability due to unusual, unforeseen circumstances (e.g., weather-related outages, utility system disruptions, natural disasters or other acts of God) shall not be considered system downtime.</p>
<p>(b) Should the system require additional planned downtime, the contractor will provide the Government at least five business days advance notice and schedule the downtime between the hours of 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. Eastern time Monday through Saturday or between 1 a.m. and 1 p.m. Sunday. The contractor shall perform all routine maintenance and updates during this time or during system downtime described in paragraph (a) above.</p>
<p>(c) The contract will measure system downtime on a monthly basis and submit a report of such downtime via email to the User Primary and Alternate POCs (Section 4.5) no later than the date the invoice is submitted.</p>
<p>2.3 Customer Support</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and CHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300). The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress. The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary or on the behalf of an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts. The Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) was established to fulfill the estimation and reporting requirements of the IPIA.</p>
<p>CMS will use a national contracting strategy to implement the Medicaid and CHIP PERM program, which includes reviewing fee-for-service claims and managed care capitation payments. This strategy engages: (1) A statistical contractor (being procured in a separate solicitation), and (2) A review contractor (RC).</p>
<p>For efficiency purposes, the CMS is combining the portions of the Statements of Work for two contracts previously awarded to Small Businesses. The efforts under the Review Contract and certain portions of the Documentation Contract will be one statement of work under one contract.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>1) Demonstrate the ability to coordinate, collect, and maintain all state Medicaid or CHIP policies and/or manuals necessary to conduct medical reviews and data processing reviews. This process will also include the collection, on a quarterly basis, and maintenance of all state policy updates related to medical, data processing, or payment policy. The policies and corresponding updates will appear in a variety of formats (e.g., via website, electronic PDF format, and hardcopy). The contractor shall have the knowledge and means to manipulate the policy formats for uniformity and relative ease of use by the reviewers. The contractor shall maintain all state Medicaid or CHIP policies in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews and data processing reviews. <br /><br />2) Demonstrate the skills used to review Medicaid and CHIP medical records in order to validate the payment amount for certain Medicaid and CHIP claims. The results of the contractor's reviews will be used to determine the payment error rates for Medicaid and CHIP payments. In order to effect accurate and timely reviews, the review contractor will gather and maintain medical policies, data processing manuals, and corresponding quarterly updates from states; will collect and maintain medical records from providers; will use the collected policies and medical records to perform medical and data processing reviews; will put into place a difference resolution process for states to dispute and resolve the contractor's findings; will provide its findings to the statistical contractor; will jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and will submit the report to CMS.</p>
<p>3) Demonstrate the knowledge to coordinate, request, obtain, scan and/or upload medical records for sampled claims. This process will include contacting the Medicaid and CHIP providers, and requesting and receiving the medical records associated with the sampled claims. The contractor shall maintain all medical records in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews.</p>
<p>4) Please note that the size and length of state policies will vary. Demonstrate the ability to coordinate efforts to obtain policies and quarterly updates of the policies for 17 Medicaid and CHIP states. Also demonstrate your ability to prepare, to handle, store, and review approximately 800 - 1200 sampled fee-for-service claims and medical records, and approximately 500 sampled managed care capitation payment records, or an average of 1500 sampled claims and medical records, for each state. The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit or a hospital stay). The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. All sampling units will be original paid claims with a paid date between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>5) Demonstrate the ability to make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical records reviews. Each sampling unit shall be reviewed to determine if it was processed through the claims payment system correctly; was medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied. The contractor shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the sampling unit, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies. The contractor shall visit each state at least twice and conduct the data processing reviews on-site, if necessary. The contractor shall also provide its review findings to the states and the statistical contractor; maintain a difference resolution process; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.</p>
<p>6) Demonstrate the ability to deliver to CMS, timely and in appropriate formats: periodic progress reports; results of medical and data processing reviews in compliance with recognized industry standards and CMS' preferred taxonomy; state-level Medicaid and CHIP policy databases; and reports and analyses, including a final national and state-specific error rate report, that may be required to meet CMS reporting requirements or improve functioning of the PERM process.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: CMS intends to award a 26-month cost plus fixed fee contract, with up to two options (total period of performance will not exceed five (5) years), to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) project. The period of performance will commence upon award of this contract or October 1, 2009, (whichever is later), and will terminate December 1, 2011.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  The Government is likely to allow contractor teaming arrangements in any solicitation expected to result from this synopsis.  A contractor teaming arrangement is when the offeror submitting a proposal will significantly depend on the products, capital contributions or expertise [in whole, or in part] of another company(or companies) to successfully complete the terms of any contract that may result from the solicitation. If, after reading the requirements listed in this synopsis, a company cannot meet all of the requirements at this time, you are highly encouraged to: 1) register your firm on the interested vendors list for this solicitation at this www.fbo.gov website, and 2)submit a capabilities package to the DeCA contracting office describing the work your company is capable of providing, even if your firm cannot at this time meet all of the requirements exactly as stated below. This is not a solicitation or request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis.  There is no solicitation or additional information available at this time. This synopsis is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition (FAR) Part 10.  

This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of small businesses,  HUBZONE (certified or non-certified) sources, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN sources, or SMALL DISADVANTAGED sources who are interested in submitting an offer on a proposed acquisition to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to each of the twelve (12) Area 4, Group 1 military commissary store locations and/or five (5) Area 4, Group 2 military store locations assigned to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).  (See attached map)

DeCAs military commissaries are Government-owned facilities designed to operate similar to commercial retail supermarkets.  DeCAs commissaries provide food items and other merchandise for resale to authorized shoppers at a cost savings when compared to the same or similar products sold in commercial retail markets.

DeCA is seeking small business concerns and/or small businesses who qualify as HUBZONE (certified or non-certified), Service Disabled Veteran, and Small Disadvantaged Businesses who are capable of meeting the requirements listed below in providing a full line of fresh fruits and vegetable products and potted plants to 12 military commissary stores geographically located in the states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota (Group 1) and/or 5 military commissary stores geographically located in the state of Alaska (Group 2).  The proposed NAICS for this acquisition is 424480, which sets the small business threshold at 500 employees.  

WEB-BASED ORDERING SYSTEM:
Contractors must be capable of providing and maintaining a licensed web-based retail ordering system.  The web-based system must have the capability to receive and process orders from all the commissary locations to be supported under any contract that may result from the proposed solicitation, send electronic price updates, create detailed sales and order history reports, and provide inventory management.  The contractor-owned pricing and ordering system must be able to interface with DeCAs existing systems, i.e. allow DeCA personnel to access their system via the Internet without any additional cost or effort to DeCA.  Therefore, all the necessary software, equipment, and/or web page developments and/or enhancements shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  

CONTRACTOR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary licenses, permits, supervision, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution, inventory management, and personnel at the contractors own facilities/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort, and deliver all required FF&V items to the various commissary locations that expect to be serviced.

Description

The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122), water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB), Mississippi.    Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688  Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric, water, and wastewater utility systems at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter Notice) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 3:00 pm EDT on Friday, May 29, 2009.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the July 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The primary distribution circuits are both overhead on utility poles and underground in conduit. The distribution system is constructed primarily in a radial configuration with provisions for crossties between circuits and within its own circuit, which allows operational flexibility for maintenance and outage considerations. There are no substations and  no switching stations, but there are some pad-mounted switches. There is one 15 kV class switchgear lineup located at the Flight Simulator Building, B268, which selects the primary feed from the dedicated Flight Simulator Circuit, 214, and an alternate feed. The switchgear consists of two 15 kV fused switches to select the primary feed and six fused switches feeding the six 750 kVA power transformers feeding the Flight Simulator Building.  Other major system components include pad-mounted switches, transformers, utility poles, utility manholes, and meters.  The meters are transformer rated electromechanical and transformer electronic. The base employs a mix of overhead pole mounted distribution transformers, three-phase and single-phase pad-mounted distribution transformers and four sets of pad-mounted aerial distribution transformers. The average depth for buried components is 3  4 and approximately 10% of the ductbank and conduit is beneath paved surfaces.  Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: Airfield Lighting, Emergency Power Generators, Parking lots and pedestrian pathway lighting fed off the building internal source, Water tower beacon lights, Military Family Housing, Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Greenwood Springs Next Generation Site, Munitions Storage Area (MSA), and the Energy Management Control System (EMCs). 

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The complete water distribution system consists of buried piping ranging in size from -inch service lines to the 16-inch water main at depths from 3 to 14 feet, an average depth of 6 feet.  The water mains and service lines are oversized cast iron (CI), transite (asbestos cement or AC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene (PE) pipe installed anytime from the 1940s to 2007.  Plastic pipe installed within the last decade, or planned to be installed in the near future, is installed with tracer wire.  There are more than 900 service connections base wide.  Approximately 5% of the distribution system mains and roughly 10% of lateral lines lie under paved surfaces.  All gate valves are contained in valve boxes and are exercised regularly.  The system pressure ranges from 60 to 66 pounds per square inch (psi).  The water quality is regulated by the Mississippi State Department of Health under Public Water System (PWS) No. 0440018 and is tested quarterly.  All fire hydrants and fire lines are connected to the potable water distribution system.  Many hydrants have been replaced over the years and are exercised regularly.  All base irrigation comes from potable water, but is also regulated with backflow prevention (BFP).  The Whispering Pines Golf Course irrigation system is operated by golf course services and is not being transferred.  The contractor will install new secondary meters on the outlet side of each BFP separating the golf course irrigation system from the main distribution system and the new PODs will be the outlet side of the new meters  The Magnolia, State and Capitol Village Military Family Housing (MFH) areas were privatized in October of 2007.  The water distribution systems within military family housing are owned by Pinnacle Hunt Company and PODs for the utility have been established for transition of ownership.  Ten buildings with 20 housing units within Capitol Village Housing remain the property of Columbus AFB as Temporary Living Facilities (TLF).  The inlet of the laterals from the main to the outlet of the residential meters at these houses is owned by CAFB.  Ownership of the existing meters and laterals are to be transferred to the contractor.  Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are: Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Greenwood Springs, Military Family Housing, Irrigation systems, Non-potable fire systems, Supplementary Water Wells, 10,000 Gallon Elevated Water Storage Tank (near MSA), Water Tower Lights, Energy Management Control System.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

Columbus AFB wastewater is collected throughout the base using service laterals, gravity mains, and force mains. A force main from the main base passes through manhole #63, where an eight inch pipe then carries it to the discharge point. The discharge point lies approximately 200 feet west of the Columbus AFB south gate. The Columbus Light and Water Department (CL&W) then collects the discharge from the installation and treats the wastewater.  A majority of the existing concrete pipe is dated more than 50 years old; however Insituform (cured-in-place), was inserted in 2000 to preserve the existing system. Currently, the system consists of vitrified clay, concrete with Insituform concrete, asbestos cement, cast iron, and a few segments of PVC. No tracer wire, marker tape, industrial waste collection system, wastewater treatment plant, or cathodic protection is present on the installation. Pipe size ranges from 4 inches to 12 inches. The systems average burial depth ranges from 3 to 14 feet, with an average burial depth of 8.5 feet deep. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the pipes are beneath paved surfaces.  There are a total of ten lift stations: four main lift stations tied to the force mains, and six smaller lift stations servicing other areas of the base. All three housing areas were privatized in 2007; therefore components in these areas are not being transferred. However, the force main leading from the Capitol Village Housing area to manhole #63 is included in this inventory.  Specifically excluded from the wastewater distribution system privatization are: Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Military Family Housing, Greenwood Springs, Grease Traps, Oil / Water Separators (OWS), Septic Tanks, Leach Fields, Grit Chambers, and Energy Management Control System (EMCS).

PROJECT DETAILS:  The project is located approximately 60 miles (97 km) northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada in Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The proposed project will rehabilitate 17.5 miles (28.2 km) of Northshore Road between mileposts 27.3 to 47.6. The route is entirely within the Lake Mead NRA. Project work includes rehabilitation, restoration, spot reconstruction (3.3 m (5.3 km)), and resurfacing of the existing roadway, parking areas, and pullouts. Roadway rehabilitation consists of widening the roadway using aggregate base to achieve the design width; pulverizing the existing asphalt pavement and aggregate base; placing of aggregate base to correct superelevation and crown; and resurfacing with hot asphalt concrete pavement. Roadway reconstruction is identified in areas where existing roadway deficiencies are excessive and can not be corrected with rehabilitation. This work includes removing the existing pavement; minor excavation and embankment to construct the subgrade; placing of aggregate base; and resurfacing with hot asphalt concrete pavement.

This is not a request for quotation.  It is an announcement for subcontracting opportunities with the University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Interested transformer manufacturers and distributors are encouraged to request a proposal package as indicated below.  

The University desires to receive proposals in response to a Request For Proposal (RFP) package which will be made available to interested companies on approximately May 7, 2009.  A Subcontract will be awarded based on a Best Value evaluation of the bid packages received.  In addition to price, other evaluation factors will be utilized in review of the proposals.
Minimum requirements for firms wishing to submit a proposal are:

1)  Proposer must be registered in the Federal Governments Central Contractor Registration (CCR),  provide its Cage Number on its proposal, and complete and return the Representations and Certifications and supplement forms included in the RFP package.	

2) Prospective proposer must demonstrate their capability to provide quality equipment by submitting a minimum of three examples of similar equipment sales they have made in the recent past (1-10 years) along with information to be used for a reference/customer satisfaction check.

3)  Reference information provided should include name of the company receiving the similar equipment, contact name,  date equipment was provided, dollar value of sale, type of equipment provided, phone number and email address.
 
RFP Evaluation:

1)	Proposals will be evaluated utilizing Best Value principles. Price, warranty, prior similar experience, customer satisfaction, and product longevity will be considered.

2)  Energy cost of transformer loss is a major component of life cycle cost of this project. University will therefore also evaluate the bids in conjunction with the transformer losses.

Guaranteed no load, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% load losses of the transformers shall be submitted by the bidder with the bid. 

1) The University will evaluate the bids using the following formula:

Evaluated Price = Bid Price + Energy Cost of three single phase Transformers Losses 

		= Bid Price + Three single phase transformers No Load Losses X P1

			      + Three single phase transformers 50% Load Loss X P2 


P1 and P2 are capitalized costs of energy due to the losses

P1 = $ 5,032/kW for no load loss
P2 = $ 3,355/kW for 50% load loss

2) The vendor shall perform tests to determine the actual transformer losses. Certified test report shall be submitted to the University as least 10 days prior to shipment. 

If the certified test results indicate the transformer losses are higher than the guaranteed values, the University reserves the right to:

	1. Reject the transformer(s) or

2. Accept the transformer(s) with a discount to the original purchasing price 
    offered by the bidder. The deduction amount shall be no less than the       
    capitalized energy cost for the extra losses calculated as follows:

    Deduction to the purchase price = P1 X D1 + P2 X D2

      P1 and P2 are capitalized costs of energy as listed above. D1 is the difference 
    of the actual no load loss by certified test and the guaranteed no load loss 
    submitted with the bid. D2 is the difference of the actual 50% load loss by 
    certified test and the guaranteed 50% load loss submitted with the bid. 
 
General Description:

Provide one (1) substation transformer, three  phase, outdoor type, oil-immersed, OA/FA/FFA, 30/40/50MVA, HV 115kV Grounded-wye, LV12.47kV Resistor Grounded-Wye, TV 7.2kV Delta grounded with all accessories.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a Purchase Order for the project entitled Modeling Review Board.  The Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement, and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant Purchase Order is anticipated to be 60 months (Base plus 4 Option Periods), with an estimated cost range between $3,000.00 to $7,000.00 per year for an estimated total cost range of $15,000.00 - $35,000.00 for 60 months.
Background-Project Description:  The MMSs Environmental Studies Program (ESP) plans, conducts, and oversees scientific studies which address the information needs regarding oil and gas exploration, development, and production on the OCS.  The MMS incorporates circulation models and other information procured by the ESP into the OSRA Model.
Several contracting efforts are presently underway to improve the OSRA Model and maintain its standing within the scientific community.  MMS is pursuing the expansion and enhancement of circulation modeling studies in the Gulf of Mexico Region.  Other efforts include a five-year contract to adapt and enhance a coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere model for the Alaska region; and an effort to model the ocean circulation along the entire Atlantic coast. Studies been conducted to improve MMSs understanding of the complex ocean circulation in the Pacific Region.  Other studies, both under contract and in-house, are addressing the need to enhance wind data sets to better represent coastal wind behavior.
MMS has felt increasing pressure from coastal States, as well as from scientific and public review of these efforts, to model the offshore circulation at ever finer temporal and spatial scales.  This requires the use of state-of-the-art techniques in numerical modeling.  Ocean circulation modeling is a complex, evolutionary field.  It requires expertise in theoretical physical oceanography, applied mathematics, numerical techniques, and advanced statistics, as well as in general physics and physical oceanography.  In order to better direct and use limited funds and results from ongoing and planned research in ocean circulation and other modeling-related areas, advanced expertise in ocean circulation modeling is required.  A Modeling Review Board (MRB) is being formed to provide advice and guidance in addressing the best technical approach to meet the MMSs ocean modeling requirements.  The MRB shall consist of at least two and no more than four members. 
Some of the ongoing MMS activities include: -Developing a high-resolution model system capable of calculating large and small-scale atmospheric flows, oceanic circulation patterns in both deep and shallow waters, ice motion and ice coverage, and oil-spill trajectories reflecting the presence of sea ice.-Producing accurate surface motion fields through numerical simulation of representative years capturing a significant portion of the atmospheric and oceanic variability.  -Using motion fields as input to oil spill trajectory modeling to simulate a large number of hypothetical oil-spill trajectories within study domains.-Formulation and implementation of new ocean circulation initiatives by establishing a concurrent field program and a circulation modeling efforts focused primarily on the newly proposed Leasing Areas.  The circulation modeling efforts would involve the development of models encompassing the entire national leasing program.
Other concerns are the planned and ongoing study initiatives in all OCS regions and the integration of study results in the OSRA Model.  The contractor is to provide expertise to MMS in an advisory capacity on an as-needed basis.
Individuals currently funded under MMS sponsored research, other than as part of a Quality Review Board or other oversight capacity may cause a conflict of interest.  Future participation in MMS research is prohibited on any research effort on which the contractor provides advice. 
OBJECTIVE:  The contractor is to provide MMS with ocean modeling expertise in an advisory capacity on an as-needed basis.
The contractors education and professional experience must be strong in:-Numerical modeling techniques; or-Expertise in comparisons and statistics  comparisons of models to observations, models to models, models to Lagrangian (drifters) measures

Background:
In 1979, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) initiated site visit auditing and monitoring of phase1 clinical trials when it established the Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS) contract.  The first contractor for the CTMS contract was Besselar Associates; the contract included only phase 1 data collection and audits.  The CTMS contract was expanded in 1983 to include not only the phase 1 data collection and the phase 1 audit program, but also the Cooperative Group co-site visits and the Cancer Center and single institution audits. Since 1983 Theradex, Inc. has been the contractor. 

Purpose and Objectives:
The purpose of this project is to assist the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), NCI in fulfilling its responsibilities to meet the regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as an Independent New Drug (IND) sponsor and funding agency by monitoring NCI sponsored clinical trials. 

Project Requirements:
Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:

1) Provide a protocol central patient registration, protocol patient data capture resource, and patient data quality control reviews for the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI for clinical investigators conducting phase 0 (exploratory IND), phase 1 and selected phase 2 clinical trials.

2) Provide an on-site auditing resource for the DCTD to assure that contractors, grantees and other clinical investigators conducting phase 0, phase 1 and selected phase 2 clinical trials are in compliance with federal regulations, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and NCI policies and procedures in order to verify submitted protocol patient data, assure the quality of submitted data, assure protocol compliance, and assure patient safety through proper reporting.

3) Assure the DCTD that the quality assurance programs of the Cooperative Groups, Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) Research Bases, the Clinical Trials Support Unit (CTSU), and other selected multi-institutional consortiums are actively monitoring their NCI sponsored clinical studies in compliance with the AGuidelines for Monitoring of Clinical Trials for Cooperative Groups, CCOP Research Bases, and the Cancer Trials Support Unit. This shall be accomplished by attending as co-site visitors scheduled audits conducted by Cooperative Groups, Cancer Center CCOP Research Bases, and the CTSU or selected consortiums.

4) Assure the DCTD that all cancer centers, single institutions, multi-institutional consortiums and networks conducting clinical trials using DCTD sponsored trials are in compliance with Federal regulations, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and NCI policies and procedures.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The project is planned to be issued during the Summer 2009.  The project will be completed in two phases.  The construction will occur during the Fall 2009 and Spring 2010.<BR><BR>The work of this project involves installing a vertical bedrock foundation grout curtain for the dam embankment at Hop Brook Lake.  The vertical grout curtain shall be installed along the same alignment as the originally installed foundation cut-off grout curtain.  The alignment of the curtain runs from abutment to abutment, and down to the upstream toe in the center, thus forming a V-shape as seen both in plan view and in section view.<BR><BR>The curtain shall consist of three lines; a center line, an upstream line, and a downstream line, with the lines being 5 feet apart.  The holes comprising the upstream and downstream lines shall be vertical while the center line holes shall be slightly inclined (15 degrees) south or west along the curtain's alignment and drilled to a depth of sixty feet into bedrock.  Primary hole spacing shall be 10 feet.  Holes shall extend from the riprapped upstream dam face down through the embankment (0-30 feet thick) and extend an additional 60 feet into the foundation bedrock, which is locally highly fractured and folded granitic gneiss.  <BR><BR>In order to ease access and perform work on the 2.5H:1V riprapped slope, crushed stone shall be placed along the curtain alignment to form an access road or drilling platform.    Prior to production grouting, the Contractor shall develop a suite of well-balanced and stable grout mixes that meet the project requirements on the cut-off wall test segment/panel.  An additional component of this project is the installation of four piezometers, three on the downstream face near the right abutment, and one on the far left abutment.  The piezometer installation shall be completed prior to the curtain installation.<BR><BR>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work requirements stated above.  Firms must submit past demonstrated construction experience on drilling and grouting work on sloped dam embankments.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $153,263.06.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant wipes; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant 8 -10 ounce containers; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant, spray bottle 12-24 ounce container; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant wipes tub container; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant wipes (extra large size) in canister.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. <BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR>6.  Vendors must show that products are registered with Environmental Protection Agency<BR>7.  Products must be available in at least spray bottles and wipes    <BR>8.  Precautionary statements must be on each package/label<BR>9. Efficacy claims at a minimum for salmonella enterica; statphylococcus aureus; pseudomonas aerguginosa, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, Vanocomycin Resistant Enterococci, Escherichia coli organism kill time should be displayed on packaging and in literature<BR>10.  Expiration date must be easily identified on each package<BR>11.  Products are for use on hard, non-porous surfaces only<BR>12.  Contents of each packet are marked to identify the product <BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will validate/approve the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR>  <BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1. Contents of each packet are easily identified well marked. <BR>a. Allows staff to quickly select products. Saves time.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting <BR>c. Product packaging will be observed during the evaluation<BR><BR>2. Wipes can be opened easily <BR>a. Saves time for staff.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting <BR>c. Process will be observed during the evaluation using pull, wipe and toss maneuver <BR><BR>3. Product expiration date is easily identifiedwell marked package. <BR>a. Allows staff to view expiration date quickly for efficacy of product<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting <BR>c. Product container will be observed during the evaluation<BR><BR>4. Disposable wipes are strong enough to prevent tearing during use. <BR>a. Tearing or shredding wipe may cause incomplete contact and affect kill times.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation for tears<BR><BR>5.  Product packaging is easy to close using one hand<BR>a. Saves time for staff, prevents drying <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting <BR>c. Process will be observed during the evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 20 May 2009 3PM CDT<BR>

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Needles.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Safety Needles product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Safety Needles product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needles, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $627,154.55.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Safety Needle products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Blood collection needles with an integrated safety shield that fully covers needle after use with luer adapter 21 gauge by 1.25 inches; Safety needle 18 gauge by 1 1/2 inches; general use needle/hypodermic needle with shielding mechanism, 23 gauge by 1 inch; general use needle/hypodermic needle with shielding mechanism, 25 gauge by 5/8 inch; general use needle/hypodermic needle with shielding mechanism, 25 gauge  by 1 inch; general use needle/hypodermic needle with shielding mechanism, 22 gauge by 1 inch; general use needle/hypodermic needle with shielding mechanism, 25 gauge by 1 inch.  Vendor are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR> 2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety needle product line.  Vendors must provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note: Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Central Region Prime Vendor.  Currently, the Central Region (6,7,8) Prime Vendor is Cardinal Healthcare for distribution in the Region.  (Note:  Vendors whose products are not available through the regional prime vendor will be disqualified.)  Vendors must provide documentation of agreement with the Prime Vendor.<BR><BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  (Note: Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified, and if lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are required to provide a quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO.<BR><BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Vendors must provide contact information (i.e., name, address, phone number, and e-mail address) of their regional representative. <BR>6.  Vendors must provide educational tools and materials for Safety Needle products, and provide evidence of this with the initial submittals.  For instance, provide literature on the tools/materials available.  <BR>7.  Vendors must provide products with visible expiration dating on the labeling.<BR>8.  The exposed sharp is permanently blunted or covered after use and prior to disposal.<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process:  		<BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR>	<BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR> Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.  Ease of Use (ability to deploy safety feature with single hand)<BR>           a. Safety feature can be activated using a one-handed technique <BR>           b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting <BR>           c. This product will be observed to see if there is difficulty deploying safety feature  		<BR> 2.  The devise operates reliably <BR>          a.  A clear and unmistakable change (either audible or visible) occurred when the       safety is activated<BR>          b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting<BR>          c. This product will be observed for audible or visible changes in the safety feature<BR><BR>3.  The device allows for rapid visualization of flashback in the catheter or chamber<BR>          a. Flashback indicates proper vascular access has occurred.<BR>          b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting<BR>          c. This product will be observed for flashback in the catheter or chamber<BR><BR>4.   The safety mechanism activated each time the device was used when used per instructions<BR>         a. The safety feature activates without affecting insertion <BR>         b. This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting <BR>         c. The user will observe the safety feature to note if it interferes with needle   insertion.<BR><BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 20 May 2009 3PM CDT<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. 

BACKGROUND: 
The U.S. Coast Guard Medium Range Surveillance Maritime Patrol Aircraft (HC-144A) is a transport and surveillance aircraft manufactured by European Aeronautic Defense & Space Co. (EADS); Construciones Aeronautica Sociedad Annima (CASA) designated as a CN-235-300M-CG01 that is used to perform search and rescue, enforcement of laws and treaties including illegal drug interdiction, marine environmental protection, military readiness, and International Ice Patrol missions, as well as cargo and personnel transport. It can perform aerial delivery of search and rescue equipment such as rafts, pumps, and flares and can be used as command and control platform. 

SOURCES SOUGHT: 
The Coast Guard is seeking sources to procure spare parts for a fleet of HC-144A aircraft. The USCG must make awards to the aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or component OEMs or OEM distributors as they are the only source(s) known with the proprietary drawings and data rights necessary to maintain configuration control of the aircraft. The U.S. Coast Guard does not own, nor can it provide specifications, plans, drawings or other technical data. HC-144A spare parts are solicited by OEM part number or OEM authorized alternate part numbers thus no substitutions will be given consideration.  Components that contain firmware or software shall be delivered with the specified version of firmware or software installed.  No substitutions of firmware or software versions shall be authorized. Reconditioned/Used Material is not acceptable. 

Suppliers shall be able to provide necessary certifications including traceability to the OEM to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on an U.S. Coast Guard aircraft.  Traceability means that the supplier must be able to show clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor. 

The spare parts identified as major components are as follows: Electro-Optical Infrared (EO-IR) components, Surveillance and imaging radar including the receiver transmitter, signal processor and antennas (APS 143C(V) 3) components, Audio control components, Accumulators, Integrated Engine Display System (I.E.D.S.) which monitors engine performance, starters, generators, flight control components, landing gear components, actuators, propeller components, engines, engine components, inverters, instruments, indicators, control units, wheels, brakes, tires, sensors, valves, Electronic Support Measures (EMS) and switches.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Upcoming Funding Opportunity Announcement:  "RecoveryAct: Large Wind Turbine Drivetrain Testing Facility"
<SOLNBR>
<ARCHDATE>09302009
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:pamela.brodie@go.doe.gov">Sara Wilson, Contract Officer</a>
<DESC>This is a Notice of an Upcoming Funding Opportunity Announcement. NOAPPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.Subject: Notice of Intent to Issue Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) No.: To Be Determined Description: The Department of Energys (DOE) Golden Field Office (GO) intends to issue, on behalf of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program (WHTP), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled Recovery Act: Large Wind Turbine Drivetrain Testing Facility.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) enables DOE to support research and development for increasing the reliability of large-scale wind turbines. The United States lacks a test stand large enough to test todays utility-scale turbine systems and larger designs.  A large drivetrain testing facility, which will feature an instrumented dynamometer test stand, will enable the wind industry to develop, test and validate large-scale land based and off-shore wind turbine drivetrain systems domestically.  Drivetrain testing is required to demonstrate the meeting of wind turbine design standards, reduce wind turbine costs, secure product financing, and reduce the technical and financial risk of deploying mass-produced wind turbine models.  Construction and operation of an appropriately sized dynamometer and test facility in the United States will enable the identification and characterization of drivetrain design and manufacturing deficiencies for product improvement prior to commercial deployment, encourage domestic manufacturing and technology development, create jobs and result in overall improved product reliability.  The new testing capability will ultimately improve the countrys competitiveness in wind energy technology, lower energy costs for consumers, and maintain a high trajectory of wind energy growth that contributes to increasing the Nations renewable energy generation.BackgroundA major trend over the last decade within the wind industry is the use of larger wind turbines.  The average turbine size has continued to increase with each new generation of turbines.   Due to economies of size, these machines have achieved reductions in life cycle cost of energy.  The average size of wind turbines installed in the United States in 2007 increased to roughly 1.65 MW. However, turbines have already been developed that range in the 2.5 MW to 3.5 MW capacity sizes, with plans being developed for even greater power ratings.  The larger wind turbines have outpaced the availability of U.S.-based testing facilities for gear box testing. The drivetrain is the vital link transferring rotor energy to the generator in the vast majority of wind turbines. With the power capacities of wind turbines accelerating rapidly, designing ever-larger gearboxes with optimal vibration characteristics and then testing these characteristics is necessary to achieve improved performance, lifecycle and reliability.   A large U.S. dynamometer drivetrain facility is now needed to advance the industrys capabilities to perform dynamic gearbox testing and analysis.  This would allow the assessment of gearbox/drivetrain options, problems and solutions under simulated field conditions. It is critical to build a better understanding of how the wide range of possible load events translates into bearing and gear response. In addition, a new U.S. large dynamometer test facility will be needed for the following reasons:--  The long-term reliability of the current generation of megawatt-scale drivetrains has not yet been fully verified through field operating experience.  As a result of fleet-wide gearbox maintenance issues and related failures with some designs in the past, it is now becoming an increasingly standard practice to perform extensive dynamometer testing of new gearbox configurations to prove performance, durability and reliability before they are introduced into serial production. -- There is a broad consensus that wind turbine drivetrain technology will evolve significantly (based on needs) in the next several years to reduce weight and cost and improve reliability.  Dynamometer testing facilities will be critical for the research and development of the next generation of turbines to be designed and manufactured in the U.S.  These proposed facilities will provide the U.S. wind industry with an opportunity to perform research targeted at determining root causes of failure and investigating solutions. It will advance the understanding of the behavior of gear and bearing elements in wind turbines and help the U.S. industry maintain technological competitiveness and foster expanded marketshare. PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL SCOPEThe primary area of interest is the design and construction of a large dynamometer facility capable of highly accelerated life testing of 5-15MW rated land based and off-shore wind turbine drivetrains, with supporting systems, and the operation and maintenance of these facilities for the benefit of wind stakeholders nationwide.  This facility will be formally identified as a Federal User Facility and all the requirements will apply.  The proposed facility can be new construction or involve the design and modification of an existing building suitable for electrical, mechanical, and other physical needs associated with a dynamometer test stand.  Overhead cranes, access doors, and other facility infrastructure suitable for accommodating associated components and equipment will be required.  It is envisioned that the facility will include sufficient office space for permanent staff and visiting users as well as conference rooms, lunch room, restrooms, computer stations, etc. Applicants will be required to submit detailed multi-phase plans including concept designs, preliminary designs, engineering procurement and construction contract management, and operation and maintenance.  Applicants will also be required to set forth a plan for allowing users to access the facility and the disposition of intellectual property (e.g. patents, technical data) that arise as a result of testing at the facility.  Applicants need to be free of conflict of interest such as turbine manufacturers who would use the testing facility.Each proposal must include organizational participants from university, state and local government, and a plan for achieving long term sustainable operation, maintenance and funding without DOE assistance.  Leveraging of DOEs investment through applicant cost sharing will be a criterion considered in the evaluation of applications.  Applicants must demonstrate capabilities and experience in 1) drivetrain testing, 2) business management and operation of industrial facilities, and 3) ability to develop an end-user facility for the benefit of the nation. Recovery Act funds are specifically to assist in expediting the construction and deployment of shovel-ready projects and to create jobs.  Other requirements for Recovery Act projects can be found at Recovery.gov and the OMB guidelines. All proposals must demonstrate the understanding of and compliance with Recovery Act intentions and OMB guidelines.C.  General InformationDOE envisions awarding a single $45 Million financial assistance grant award on a competitive basis.   This award will require cost share contributions in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Details about cost share requirements will be included in the FOA along with the details of technical areas of interest, proposal preparation instructions and application merit review and evaluation criteria. DOE plans to release the FOA in June, 2009. The FOA will be available for viewing at Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov) and at www.FedConnect.net. Applicants are strongly encouraged to register at these sites to receive notification of announcements posted by DOE Golden Field Office.

<DESC>This is a Notice of an Upcoming Funding Opportunity Announcement. NOAPPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.Subject: Notice of Intent to Issue Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) No.: DE-FOA-0000090Description: The Department of Energys (DOE) Golden Field Office (GO) intends to issue, on behalf of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program (WHTP), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled Recovery Act:  Wind Energy Consortia between Institutions of Higher Learning and IndustryTitle IV of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 directs DOE to preserve and create jobs, promote economic recovery, and provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science.The mission of the WHTP is stewardship of national resources to increase the development and deployment of reliable, affordable, and environmentally sustainable wind and water power and realize the benefits of domestic renewable energy production.  Fulfilling this mission will result in greater energy security and enhanced domestic economic benefit through more diverse, clean, reliable, affordable, and secure domestic electricity supplies.  The Program contributes directly to EEREs and DOEs mission of improving national, energy, and economic security and of increasing the diversity of our Nations energy resources. The Program launched an effort, in collaboration with industry, to assess the potential for and impact of supplying 20% of the Nations electricity needs from wind energy.In June 2008, DOE issued the 20% Wind Energy by 2030 report.  The report found that the Nation possesses wind energy resources sufficient to meet the 20% scenario.  The major challenges identified in the report include availability of electric transmission and ability to integrate large amounts of wind energy, continued reduction in wind capital cost and improvement in turbine performance through technology advancement, and improved domestic supply chain and manufacturing capabilities.  A surge in wind capacity will require a trained and educated workforce that can manufacture, install, operate and maintain wind turbines and operate the Nations electricity transmission infrastructure.  In addition, enhanced long-term turbine reliability will require research and development (R&D) of components and improved methods for operation and maintenance (O&M) of turbines.Proposals are sought to stimulate jobs in the wind manufacturing and construction sectors, further advancements in R&D, eliminate barriers to the further deployment of wind energy, reduce the cost and risk of wind energy installations, and stimulate partnerships between institutions of higher learning and the wind industry.  The workforce development initiatives will enhance wind energy education that maps to the green energy economy, including the creation of a new generation of energy professionals and wind technologists of the future. Below is a limited list of areas in which proposals will be sought. Proposals are not limited to this list.1) Partnerships for Wind Research and Turbine Reliability: Universities in regions of the country representative of the mid-west wind belt (typically having a steady Class 3-4 resource all year) are encouraged to team with industry partners to establish facilities/equipment and a research agenda necessary to study major challenges facing todays wind industry. Proposals that address one or more challenges described in the 20% Wind Energy by 2030 report and include descriptions of how the wind hardware and software purchased will be requested.  DOE will highly encourage research in turbine reliability as a topic in any consortia proposal.2) Wind Energy Research & Development:  University R&D to advance material design, performance measurements, analytical models, and leveraging partnerships with industry to improve power systems operations, maintenance or repair operations, wind turbine and/or component manufacturing, and interdisciplinary system integration.   Fellowships, internships, etc. may be used to support the research agenda. Eligibility will be restricted to four-year institutions of higher learning, and DOE anticipates that pre-applications will be required prior to the application deadline.  All projects will be funded for maximum of two (2) years, with one or more budget periods. General InformationDOE envisions awarding two to three financial assistance grant awards on a competitive basis.  Total funding is anticipated to be $24 Million.  These awards will require cost sharing in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and Recovery Act.  Details about cost share requirements will be included in the FOA along with the details of technical areas of interest, eligibility requirements, proposal preparation instructions and application merit review and evaluation criteria. DOE plans to release the FOA in late May, 2009. The FOA will be available for viewing at Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov) and at the FedConnect site (http://www.FedConnect.net). Applicants are strongly encouraged to register at these sites to receive notification of announcements posted by DOE Golden Field Office. When the FOA is released, applications will only be received through FedConnect.  Organizations with system-to-system capabilities with Grants.gov for their submissions may continue to use their systems, and their applications will be accepted in Grants.gov to be considered for award.In anticipation of the FOA being released shortly, there are several one-time actions prospective applicants must complete in order to submit an application through FedConnect (e.g., obtain a Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, register with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and register with FedConnect).

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source procurement to Alaska Gateway School District in Tok, AK. In accordance with FAR 6.303-1 and FAC 2005-30, this special notice announcement provides the Justification and Approval Documents for Noncompetitve Contracts.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, requires a monitoring site will be established throughout the summer in an unnamed creek near Rampart Rapids.  Sampling will take place from approximately June 23 through August 28.  Gee-type minnow traps (23 x 45 cm, 0.6 cm wire mesh, 2.5 cm diameter opening), baited with salmon roe, will be placed overnight in areas associated with Chinook salmon rearing habitat, i.e., log jams, root wads, small pools, and stream banks adjacent to riffles.  All captured fish will be identified to species.  Fishing effort will be recorded as fish per trap day (24-hour).  Aquatic habitat and weather conditions will be recorded daily.  These measurements will include water temperature, river stage, water clarity, weather condition, and rainfall amount.  The summer monitoring program will involve local students, teachers, and community members in the collection, analysis, and information dissemination of project results.  The Rampart Rapids Fish Study is part of a larger project entitled: Use of non-natal streams by subyearling Chinook salmon in the upper U.S. portion of the Yukon River drainage. This larger project was funded through a reimbursable agreement after David Daum submitted a proposal in response to the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund 2008 Call for Proposals. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) accepted the Daum's proposal, which included utilizing the Alaska Gateway School District in 2008 and 2009, as well as Stanley Zuray in 2009 for the Rampart Rapids Fish Study. Daum must now complete his larger proposed project in accordance with the original proposal submitted to ADF&G. To change the proposal and subsequent vendors performing these smaller projects (Mission Creek and Rampart Rapids), would jeopardize the entire project and subject Daum from receiving any funds for this project or future projects. As part of the proposal's acceptance and funding, Daum must use local community partners to complete his project. Stanley Zuray offers the only community based student program in the Rampart Rapids and Yukon River area able to provide the services and fulfill the community partnership requirement. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to directly award to Stanley Zuray.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intended to accept proposals received.  See Numbered Note 22.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 (Alaska) intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5, Section 5.203 and is supplemented with additional information contained within to Dr. Diana Solovieva of the Institute for Sustainable Use of Natural Resources to conduct spectacled eider research in Chaun Delta, West Chukotka, Russia.
Negotiations are estimated to occur approximately 15 days following the posting of this notice, with the estimated contract award approximately May 18, 2009.  The Government is contemplating award of a firm fixed price contract with four option years.
This announcement is for information purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to compete this requirement.  A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice and currently available information about the intended recipient, is solely within the discretion of the Government.
BackgroundThe threatened spectacled eider is composed of 3 disjunct breeding populations that breed in Russia, on Alaska's North Slope, and on the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta (YKD).  Breeding biology, including measures of adult female annual survival and nest site fidelity, have been studied since 1994 at Kigigak Island on the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, but comparable studies have not been conducted elsewhere in the species' range until a study was initiated in 2003 by Dr. Diana Solovieva on Ayopechan Island in the Chaun Delta.  This proposal was reviewed by the Spectacled Eider Recovery Team and is considered a high priority recovery task.
Objectives and MethodsThe proposed project will follow the established Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge's Kigigak Island spectacled eider study protocol to provide comparable information on spectacled eider breeding biology from Russia on nests density, nest success, adult female survival, and nest site fidelity.  The principal investigator has a copy of this protocol and implemented the protocol from 2003-2005 and 2007-2008 (no funding was available for the project in 2006).  Copies are also on file in the offices of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, Fairbanks Fish and Wildlife Field Office.
Comparable data collected from the primary breeding range of the spectacled eider will be used to help identify reasons for the observed population declines in Alaska, and potentially to help define recovery actions for the species.
Products A written draft report, including data collected by following the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge's Kigigak Island spectacled eider study protocol, will be submitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service Project Officer by 31 October 2009.   Service reviewers will respond with comments no later than one month after receiving the draft report.  Authors will respond to comments and submit a final report no later than 28 February 2010. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made 15 days after publication of this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
NAVICP  intends to issue a purchase order for Qualstar LTO-3 Tape Drive upgrade, custom software/hardware package support and warranty. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR 13, Small Purchase Procedures. The services are in support of a critical need requirement to replace an LTO-1 tape drive for Fleet Meteorology and Oceanography Center, Monterey, CA. 
Per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) - Only one source/name brand will satisfy agency requirements.  This is a critical need requirement as the ATOS2 Classified cannot be backed up until this drive is restored.
The Qualstar Tape Library 88132 contains three tape drives: two LTO-1 and one LTO-3.  One of the LTO-1 drives failed and is not repairable.  The single LTO-3 tape drive needs to be paired with another LTO-3 tape drive in order to function. This upgrade also requires new LTO-3 qualified tapes and a SCSI cable to connect the new drives. 
Brand name equivalent is not acceptable. The use of a brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  
Although this notice does not constitute a request for quote, interested parties may inquire by contacting Val Hawthorne, (717) 605-3946, Valerie.hawthorne@navy.mil, on or before COB, 1200 e.s.t, 30 April 2009.

The following services are required for the base and option period:GENERAL SUPPORT:CLIN 0001	Operational Support						CLIN 0002	Project Manager						CLIN 0003	Labor Categories:Business Analyst 						Healthcare EDI Analyst					Technical Solutions Specialist					Programmer/Analyst/Systems Engineer			Implementation Analyst/Account Manager			PROVIDER TASKS: CLIN 0004	Operations Maintenance - Provider				CLIN 0005	Batch Transactions:		837 Health Care Claims (Participating Payers)					837 Health Care Claims (non-Participating Payers)				837 Health Care Claims (Industry Standard Print to Paper)			837 Health Care Claims ( w/MRA Attached Print to Paper)			835 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (Participating)			835 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (non-Par)				277 Health Care Claim Status Response 			CLIN 0006	Real-time Transactions:		270 Health Care Eligibility Request						271 Health Care Eligibility Response					NCPDP B1 Rx Billing/B3 Rx Rebill							NCPDP B2 Rx Reversal							NCPDP E1 Eligibility Verification			PAYER TASKS: CLIN 0007	Operations Maintenance - Payer				CLIN 0008	Batch Transactions:		837 Health Care Claims							835 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice			CLIN 0009	Real-time Transactions:		270/271 Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inq. and Response 	276/277 Health Care Claim Status and Response 		278 Health Care Services Review and Response		4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  The statutory authority of this justification is FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  This contract is required to avoid a catastrophic failure of third party health care revenue streams inherent to the daily operational activities of VHA as a provider and payer of heath care services.  VHA as a provider collects over $2.4 billion in third-party reimbursement revenues directly supporting patient care activities and as a payer VHA pays over $4 billion in payments to community health care practitioners in support of care provided to eligible veterans and their dependents. In addition to the financial losses, disruption of these critical EDI HCCH services would be the cause of:"	Revenue disruptions to community health care practitioners providing critical health care to veterans and their dependents where VHA functions as a health care payer,  "	Interruption of legally mandated submission of claims for Medicare equivalent remittance information,"	Non-compliance with the electronic transaction standards and national provider identifier provisions of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:  The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in FAR 6.302-2 and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203. A full and open competition is currently in progress for global EDI service capabilities.  While the initial target for contract award was prior to the end of calendar 2008, it was anticipated that the timeline might be longer.  In fact, a number of factors are impacting the proposal evaluation process: the number and complexity of the proposals received, the formal Technical Evaluation process reviews and need for technical and legal guidance, the need to enter into discussions with vendors, and finalization of the award process.  Thus, a reasonable timeline for contract award is early or mid April 2009.  Further, contract award, especially if it is to a new vendor, will need to be followed by a start-up period as an orderly transition is planned and implemented in order to avoid disruption of VHA revenue.  This may well involve a phased cut-over of certain EDI transactions until all transactions are successfully migrated to the new vendor.For these reasons-anticipated date of contract award plus the need for orderly transition to selected vendor-a bridge contract is needed with the current vendor.  The period of performance for the bridge contract allows for overlap with the period of performance for any new vendor selected.  The current contract for EDI HCCH services expires on March 31, 2009, and VHA must ensure continuity of VHA EDI revenue processes. 7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The contracting officer will conduct a price analysis to ensure prices proposed are both fair and reasonable.8.  Description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:  See Paragraph 6 above.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  Emdeon is currently providing EDI HCCH services under contract V101-(93)P-2125 which expires March 31, 2009 and currently processes over 23 million VHA EDI transactions per year.  10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:  Due to the nature (complexity, scope, operational integration) of the current work it is not feasible for anyone other than the current vendor to maintain current capabilities while VA pursues another contract for these services.  11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: There are no barriers to competition as evidenced by the Department's issuance of an unrestricted solicitation (VA-101-08-RP-0260) in September 2008 for a five year contract for comprehensive clearing house services. Technical proposals for this solicitation are under evaluation and an award is anticipated in April of this year.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;52.209-5<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008)</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none">&nbsp;(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>&nbsp;(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>&nbsp;(A) Are (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-hyphenate: none">&nbsp;(B) Have (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;(C) Are (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) The Offeror has (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) has not (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 9pt">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Definition. HUBZone small business concern, as used in this clause, means a small business concern that appears on the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns maintained by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation preference. (1) Offers will be evaluated by adding a factor of 10 percent to the price of all offers, except--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Offers from HUBZone small business concerns that have not waived the evaluation preference; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Otherwise successful offers from small business concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) The factor of 10 percent shall be applied on a line item basis or to any group of items on which award may be made. Other evaluation factors described in the solicitation shall be applied before application of the factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) A concern that is both a HUBZone small business concern and a small disadvantaged business concern will receive the benefit of both the HUBZone small business price evaluation preference and the small disadvantaged business price evaluation adjustment (see FAR clause 52.219-23). Each applicable price evaluation preference or adjustment shall be calculated independently against an offeror's base offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These individual preference amounts shall be added together to arrive at the total evaluated price for that offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) Waiver of evaluation preference. A HUBZone small business concern may elect to waive the evaluation preference, in which case the factor will be added to its offer for evaluation purposes. The agreements in paragraph (d) of this clause do not apply if the offeror has waived the evaluation preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>___<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offeror elects to waive the evaluation preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) Agreement. A HUBZone small business concern agrees that in the performance of the contract, in the case of a contract for</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) General construction, at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel will be spent on the concern's employees or the employees of other HUBZone small business concerns; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) Construction by special trade contractors, at least 25 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel will be spent on the concern's employees or the employees of other HUBZone small business concerns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contractor represents that it (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) is, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code <span style="mso-field-code: ' FORMTEXT '"><span style="mso-no-proof: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>- assigned to contract number <span style="mso-field-code: ' FORMTEXT '"><span style="mso-no-proof: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a Request for Proposal (RFP No. HSFE11-09-R-0004). This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in five (5) parts: (1) General Requirements; (2) Specific Requirements; (3) Cost Proposals; (4) Evaluation Factors for Award; (5) Point of Contact; and (6) Proposal Requirements.
<p>1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a need for the delivery of Pre-Retirement Planning Seminars. Typically, the pre-retirement seminars are made available to employees who are within 5-10 years of retirement eligibility. Each seminar should last two (2) days and provide in-depth information to assist employees in making critical decisions as they approach and prepare for retirement. TXNPSC does not have the necessary subject matter knowledge to conduct the seminars of the scope desired, nor is such expertise available elsewhere in FEMA. In addition, by addressing groups rather than single employees, the seminars represent a cost-effective way of conveying retirement information. See Statement of Work (Attachment #1).</p>
<p>2. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: <br />(A) Scope of work: The Contractor will provide an off-the-shelf seminar meeting TXNPSC requirements. **See Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 46.101 for "off-the-shelf" and other definitions. Each Pre-Retirement Planning Seminar will be for two (2) days and up to thirty-four (34) participants will normally attend each session. It is also anticipated that the Pre-Retirement Planning Seminar will be delivered two (2) times a year. <br /><br />(B) Course Contents: The objective of the seminar is to provide TXNPSC employees with an array of information to increase their level of understanding and awareness of retirement policies and procedures. The training will also enable TXNPSC employees to better plan for and make decisions about retirement. The Contractor will use teaching techniques appropriate to the subject matter and the audience. The Pre-Retirement Planning Seminar will cover, at a minimum, the following subjects: Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) including spousal annuities, Social Security, Medicare programs, Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), Long Term Care Insurance (LTCI), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA), and Federal employees' health and life insurance programs.</p>
<p>(C) Course Materials: The Contractor will prepare a seminar binder for each participant. The binders will contain current and up-to-date written materials the Pre-Retirement Planning seminars.

The Contractor shall e-mail any training material to the Contracting Officer Representative (COTR) that will be used in delivering the material to TXNPSC employees via the audio visual GFE. The COTR will in-turn download the Contractor's training material to a DVD for the Contractor's use. Copier machines or the like will not be available for Contractor use. **The Contractor is prohibited from bringing any computer related equipment or accessories of any kind onto Federal property, including but not limited to: laptops, memory sticks of any kind, CDs, or DVDs. The Contractor may conduct an initial Pre-Retirement Seminar walk-through after the effective date of the contract but before the first scheduled seminar. A minimum of two (2) copies of all seminar materials, (including but not limited to the instructor's guide, participant's manual, handouts, and other visual and audio materials) must be provided at that time. The Contractor will be expected to make revisions to the seminar materials as requested by the COTR. The Contractor will be expected to conduct a second walk through at no additional cost to TXNPSC, if requested by the COTR. On agreed upon dates, the Contractor will conduct pre-retirement seminars, using qualified instructors. TXNPSC will provide classroom space for the seminar sessions. The Contractor will bring seminar materials to TXNPSC on the day in which the seminar is being conducted.</p>
<p>(D) Location of the Seminars: seminar sessions will be held at TXNPSC, 3900 Karina Lane, Denton, TX, 76208.</p>

There will be a one hour lunch break between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM and at least one15 minute break in the morning and one 15 minute break in the afternoon. TXNPSC will give the Contractor at least one (1) week notice if class needs to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>(F) Evaluation of Course: TXNPSC will evaluate the seminar(s) using participant questionnaires developed by the Contractor or TXNPSC and provide the results of the evaluations to the Contractor. If the Contractor wants to use its own evaluation form (which should be included in its technical proposal), TXNPSC will distribute it to seminar participants. However, TXNPSC has the right to choose which form to use.</p>
<p>(G) Applicability of FAR Provisions: The selected offeror must comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses that apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>The Office of Plant and Dairy Foods, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has a need for a commercial scale ultrasonic processing unit. The 4kW unit must be particularly effective for continuous operation. It will be controlled by a microprocessor and equipped with an LCD status display as well as for external control signals. The system must be able to operate under extreme operation conditions such as dust, dirt, temperature and humidity.
The sonotrode must be effective on applications such as agricultural washing/sanitization. Power efficiency of real energy into the product must be 85% conversion. The unit must be easily retrofitted to existing plant equipment via antivibrational flange so that energy goes through the sonotrode to the product and not into the pipes, valves, vessels, etc. The system must have automatic resonance frequency tracking. Every food product has its own unique resonance frequency; therefore the unit must automatically lock onto this and re-scan every 0.1 of a second to find the new resonance frequency in case there are any changes in process condition such as temperature, pressure, viscosity, gas/air entrainment. The resonance frequency must allow you to work/operate at 85% energy efficiency. The unit must have built in sensors to report any change in process conditions to the generator so that the system never overloads.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for supplies in which the government intends to acquire in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA has a requirement to purchase components and parts manufactured by Linear Technology to make circuit boards for TAO project as follows:
<p>QTY LTC Part No. Description<br />1050 LT1019CN8-2.5#PBF Integrated Circuit - 2.5 V Precision Volt Reference in DIP pkg<br />1000 LT1034BCZ-1.2#PBF Integrated Circuit - 1.2 V Precision Voltage Reference in TO-92 pkg<br />1000 LT1054CS8#PBF Integrated Circuit - Switched-Cap Voltage Converter w/Reg in SO8 pkg<br />2300 LT1078S8#PBF Integrated Circuit - Dual Op-Amp in SO8 pkg<br />3100 LTC1044CS8#PBF Integrated Circuit -CMOS Switched Cap Voltage Converter in SO8 pkg<br />1081 LTC1047CSW#PBF Integrated Circuit -CMOS Dual Op Amp in WSO16 pkg<br />987 LTC1100CSW#PBF Integrated Circuit -Precision Instrumentation Amp in WSO16 pkg</p>
<p>Background:PMEL maintains an array of buoys in the equatorial Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans for support of climate studies with an emphasis on El Nino prediction and monitoring. The TAO project is tasked with implementing and maintaining this array with the most accurate and reliable measurements of meteorology parameters, subsurface temperature, pressure and conductivity measurements. The TAO data, transmitted in real time via satellite, are used as inputs to a large variety of weather and climate analysis and prediction products, including El Nino - Southern Oscillation prediction models. The present ability to make seasonal to interannual climate forecasts for North America depends on the existence of, and the data transmitted from, the TAO array in the Pacific. International partners including Brazil, France and India, rely on data from buoys in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans for predicting weather phenomenon such as hurricane formation, rainfall pattern changes in Africa and South America, and the Southeast Asian Monsoon. These measurements use PMEL designed and built sensors that are secured to the mooring line and are attached to the surface buoy. These sensors communicate to instrumentation on the surface buoy which transmits the subsurface data, along with meteorology measurements, back to NOAA facilities via satellite. The subsurface instrumentation modules were custom designed by PMEL and incorporate a battery powered circuit board which will operate for 18 months on the standard compliment of three 9V batteries. This circuit was designed specifically to use these 7 Linear Technology components because of their performance, stability and low power consumption. These components use proprietary technology and are only manufactured by Linear Technology. <br />This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Only firms that can provide the exact components and parts described herein will be considered. A fixed firm order will be issued with delivery date of no later than July 20, 2009. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. This RFQ closes at 4:00 p.m. May 14, 2009. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention Maria Mendoza at (206 )527-7513 or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov . This is a small purchase action estimated not to exceed $100,000.00.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.

As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Photographic Interpretive Panel for MIB Rooftop TerraceRFQ NBCWZ900568Vendor Questions and Government Responses
The Q&A will also be posted to the the solicitation announcement at http://www.acd.nbc.gov/solic/openmarket.asp under this Solicitation number.
1.            What is the status of elevator access to the rooftop terrace for delivery of the panel(s)?                 ANSWER:  Contractor shall use the DOI freight elevator to deliver and install the panel.  The freight elevator grants access up to the 7th floor, with a smaller secondary elevator (7'7" (h) / 6'6" (w) / 4'4" (d); max capacity 2500 lbs) between the 7th and 8th floors.     2.            How should offerors structure the Firm Fixed Price quote?               ANSWER:  Offerors shall provide a quote with a breakdown to a level of detail appropriate to identify the various components of the tasks (ie, a fully-detailed breakout to the exact number of labor hours may not be necessary, but should at least differentiate the costs of photography from the costs of graphic design, or installation, etc).  In addition to meeting the minimum task requirements, offerors may propose additional option pricing as they see fit (for additional images for promotional purposes, for example) that the Government may accept, award, or exercise as it sees fit.     3.           What are the safety requirements of a Fall Protection Plan to get access to the rooftop of Wing 1 of the building?              ANSWER:  DOI has a duty consisting of monitoring contractors' activities and bringing any uncontrolled hazards to their attention, for example, fall hazards.  It is then up to contractors to ensure that the hazards are addressed.              Offerors shall recommend a designated area be established on Wing 1 East roof top.  The designated area can be established by using a line (rope) supported by stanchions.  The line shall be installed in such a manner that its lowest point, including sag, is no less than 34 inches (86 cm) nor more than 39 inches (1 meter) from the work surface. The line forming the designated area shall be clearly visible from within the designated area.  Stanchions shall be erected as close to the work area as permitted by the task but not less than 6 feet from the unprotected sides or edges that is parallel to the photographer's tripod.              Additionally, contractor shall be responsible for securing all equipment while working on Wing 2.  While Wing 2 is surrounded by a safety rail for personal safety, the vendor is responsible for the safety of their equipment while working near the railing.     4.           Would it be possible to gain access to the rooftop terrace during early morning or late evening to take pictures?              ANSWER:  Regular work hours are identified in Section 8.10 of the SOW.  Work outside of these hours may be arranged, but must be pre-approved by the COTR or CO.     5.           How will payment under the contract occur?               ANSWER:  Generally Firm-Fixed-Price contracts are invoiced and paid upon completion.  However, offerors may propose a Payment Plan with their proposal submission, to be evaluated by the Government.  Process payments can occur no more than once monthly, and should be linked to the delivery and Government inspection/acceptance of project deliverables (ie, approval of the three installation plans, delivery and installation of completed panel, etc).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: Project ZHTV0700191. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The  Period of Performance is 300 days.

NAICS CODE: 236220. Size Standard $33.5M  Renovate Facility Phase 1, Facility 20011.  This project is phase I of a multi-phase whole building renovation plan. This phase includes complete replacement of all air handling units, the heat exchanger, electrical distribution switchboard and circuit breakers.  All restrooms will be completely replaced, some in different locations than the existing.  A new sanitary sewer line will be installed.  The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Special Requirement/Considerations: The building will remain occupied during this construction. Many of the new utility lines will be above the ceiling in the corridor requiring the contractor to plan his work to meet fire safety requirements for egress.  The air handler and associated ductwork replacement will need to be accomplished during the no heat/no cool time of the year requiring the contractor to plan ahead to have all his material on the site before he begins demolition.  The restroom work will be phased to allow the occupants to have access to at least one working restroom at all times during the construction. All this phasing of work will require the contractor to be able to manage multiple disciplines in order to minimize detrimental effects to building occupants.  Constant communication with the building occupants and the fire department will be critical.  The main occupants of this building are Air Force lawyers and the OSI.  An unscheduled power outage could cause a mission impact for these organizations and therefore is unacceptable.

Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

 In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.

NOTES: 1. The specifications and drawings are posted with this notice and are for informational purposes only.  The solicitation with the official specifications and drawings will be available on the World Wide Web on or about 13 May 2009, at http://www.fbo.gov , as well as the following public bid room locations:

<DESC><p>This is the first amendment to the original presolicitation notice for Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 posted on 24 November 2008. This amendment makes several changes. It includes a Safety Act statement, an updated release date, more information on the bidder's library, and a small business statement. The Global Systems Positioning (GPS) Wing will release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) on or before 31 March 2009. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category ID program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1.0 and 2.0. Block 1.0 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1.0 capabilities, Block 2.0 will integrate GPS IIIA satellite capabilities (L1C) into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C), on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 45 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Response from small business and small disadvantaged businesses is encouraged.<br />BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.</p>
<p>The DoD mandates the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than a username and password, before granting access.</p>
<p>In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the aforementioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components:</p>
<p>(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software.</p>
<p>(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate<br />http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html</p>
<p>This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. <br />OMBUDSMAN: The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill.

<DESC><p>This is the second amendment to the original presolicitation notice for Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 posted on 24 November 2008. This amendment makes several changes. It includes a Federally Funded Research and Development Center statement and an updated release date with additional information. The Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Wing expects to release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) prior to 10 April 2009. This announcement will be updated on the actual date of RFP release. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category ID program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1.0 and 2.0. Block 1.0 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1.0 capabilities, Block 2.0 will integrate GPS IIIA satellite capabilities into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C), on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 45 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Response from small business and small disadvantaged businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.</p>
<p>The DoD mandates the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than a username and password, before granting access.</p>
<p>In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the aforementioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components:</p>
<p>(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software.</p>
<p>(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate<br />http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html</p>
<p>This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.</p>

Amendment A003 issued 4/21/09 to extend the proposal date indefinitely.  A future amendment will be issued to establish a new proposal date.
FYI: In accordance with the Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 1.1.2 The FAA has been relieved from the requirements of the Brooks Act.  Therefore, we are allowed to request pricing information prior to the technical "down-select". (Added 4/14/09)
Amendment A002 issued 4/6/09 to add CLINs for Overtime for Non-exempt Personnel.
Amendment A001 issued to correct the clause reference in the Travel and Subsistence CLINs to H.8, rather than H.12.

<DESC>Questions and Answers (Q&A)

Question #1 The proper NAICS code for this offering should be 812332....This is the correct NAICS classification for Industrial Launderers, which include Uniform Rental and Laundry Services as titled on this solicitation.  The SBA Size Standard is $14 Million.

Response Question #1: The NAICS code is changed to #812332 Industrial Launderers.

Question #2 Statement of Work--Paragraph 2.6 states that "No rental uniform shall have a wearing cycle of longer than 18 months."  This statement makes the assumption that the garments won't last beyond 18 months, which is not true...Depending upon the usage and how "hard" a wearer is on the garments, some garments may need replacing BEFORE 18 months, and many should wear well beyond 18 months.  Especially with respect to the Hazard Level 2 garments requested, the industry standard useful life on those garments (due to the Nylon content in them) is twice as long as with 100% cotton, level 1 garments...Many of those garments have a useful life, depending upon usage, of up to 3 years or longer in many instances due to their inherent durability in the Level 2 fabric.   If you pre-determine a garment life of only 18 months for all garments, then you are telling the offerors that they will have to invest double (twice the garments necessary to fulfill the requirement at the outset) during the term of the contract.  Thus, an offeror would have to account for double the investment, and thus, the pricing will reflect the double investment.  Almost all uniform rental solicitations have wording such as this instead:  "Garments in need of replacement due to normal wear and tear will be replaced with new garments during the term of the agreement, on an as needed basis, and in all cases, at the discretion of the CO or end user."  This way only garments that need replacing get replaced, saving both sides the expense of a forced, unnecessary replacement, but still leaving the control of what does and does not get replaced at your discretion.  This is a standard operating procedure in our industry, and as long as you control it, should not be a problem.

Response Question #2: Please delete the last sentence in paragraph 2.6 of the SOW No rental uniform shall have a wearing cycle of longer than eighteen (18) months" and replace with this sentence: Garments in need of replacement due to normal wear and tear will be replaced with new garments during the term of the agreement, on an as needed basis, and in all cases, at the discretion of the Contracting Officers Representative (COR).
Question #3 SOW--2.7 With respect to replacement costs of the uniforms, this paragraph states that garments that are less than 9 months old, the replacement would be 50% of the cost.  This must be a mistake and does not make any sense.....If a new wearer gets all new garments (over $1000 worth for 11 sets of clothes), then leaves after a week or even a few weeks, why wouldn't the replacement cost be 100%.  This type of action would cause us to lose money, which I don't think is the intent of the rule. We have seen many specs which call for a decreasing replacement value based on life of the garment, but in almost all cases, the replacement cost would be due at 100% for the first period (usually up to a year), then graduate down in value each year after that.  Again, this rule seems to base itself on an 18 month useful life, which, as noted in 2) above, is not the industry standard at all.  If this clause remains (much like the one discussed in #2 above), then again, it would be reflected in much higher pricing than is necessary if the replacement costs guidelines were industry standard.

Response Question# 3:Please delete the second, third and fourth sentences in paragraph 2.7 of the SOW "If Plant Division fails to return a uniform and the uniform is less than nine months old, Plant Division shall pay half of the replacement cost of the uniform.  If the uniform is between nine months and fifteen months old, Plant Division shall pay one quarter of the replacement cost of the uniform.  If the uniform is more than fifteen months old, Plant Division shall not be charged for that particular uniform."

Please replace these deleted sentences in paragraph 2.7 of the SOW with - "If Plant Division fails to return a uniform and the uniform is less than one year old, Plant Division shall pay 100% of the replacement cost of the uniform.  If the uniform is more than one year old, Plant Division shall pay a replacement cost for the uniform by applying a decreasing replacement value that is based upon the life of the uniform, as mutually agreed upon between the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and the Contactor

   Question #4 SOW--3.1.2 With respect to Shirts sizes, stock sizes of up to 3XL is available from all manufacturers, and some (including our supplier) carry up to 4X....but any sizes larger than that would be available, but only as a special custom cut.  I assume prices quoted are for stock sizes and colors available from most any manufacturer....Again, this is standard availability to the industry.
 
Response Question #4: Pleas add the following sentence to paragraph 3.1.2 of the SOW - Prices quoted should be for stock sizes and colors available from most manufacturers.

<DESC>1.  Respondent Inquiry: Do you have a synopsis of the pertinent testing requirements per IEC Standard 60945 for us to design to, or can you provide a copy of the standard?	Government Response: This is the international standard for maritime navigation and radio communication equipment.  It regulates the level of interferences allowed by radio frequencies.  
2.  Respondent Inquiry: The secondary homing alertment is listed as 121.5mHz. What is the primary homing alertment?  Is a receiver architecture already in place?	Government Response: The only homing alertment expected is 121.5 mHz. The secondary alertment is the homing.Our desire for the primary means of alertment is to be via the VHF.  
3.  Respondent Inquiry: The GPS receiver is listed as 20 channels parallel.  Is this a military chipset?  Why are 20 channels required (accuracy or fix time or something else)?  Would 12 channels be acceptable?	Government Response: This is not a military chipset, but 20 channels are preferable because it provides a greater degree of accuracy to the GPS coordinates.  Considering the expected purpose of these units, the closer the GPS tracks the survivors the better.  
4.  Respondent Inquiry: The GPS sensitivity is listed as -160dBM.  Most commercial chip sets reference -160dBM in their spec sheets, but in reality they are -148dBM for a fix in 30 seconds.  Is a military chipset available for use in the device?	Government Response: There is no known military chipset.    If -160dBM is not possible and none of the responses received meet -160dBM, then this would be addressed in defining any future requirements.
5.  Respondent Inquiry: The schedule is listed as 1 May 2010 for prototype test articles.  Is this a firm date that is tied to the expected release date of a purchase order?	Government Response: If the government releases a purchase order, May 1, 2010 is the anticipated date that prototype test articles would be needed.

_______________


The US Coast Guard invites interested parties to attend an Industry Day Conference to acquaint potential offerors with aspects of an upcoming acquisition of Cutter-based boats.  The Industry Day event will be on 13 May 2009 at 0900 at the Westin Hotel located at National Harbor, Maryland  20745.  

Specifically, the Coast Guard intends to procure a large (11 meter) boat for a variety of Over-the-Horizon operations (CB-OTH Mark V) and a medium size (7 meter) boat (CB-OTH Mark IV) for the same purposes.  A Request for Information seeking sources for this procurement was posted in FedBizOpps March 26, 2009 under the title Request for Information by the U.S. Coast Guard for Proven Cutter Boat Designs, HSCG23-09-R-2DB011. The posting is included below.   

Parties planning to attend the conference must pre-register by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Laura Spillane at laura.spillane@uscg.mil.  The registration message must include the company name and address, number of attendees (up to three), names of attendees, and company POC name, phone and e-mail address for purposes of the Industry Day Conference.  Registrations are due not later than 6 May 2009. 

Material presented and discussed at the Industry Day Conference will be informational only.  All official requirements and information regarding the Industry Day Conference and any resulting RFP will be posted at FedBizOpps.   No videotaping or tape recording is allowed at the conference. 

This notice should not be construed (1) as a commitment by the U.S. Coast Guard to enter into any agreement with any entity participating in the Industry Day Conference, (2) as a commitment to issue any RFP concerning the subject of this notice, or (3) as a request for proposals or request for information.

26 March 2009 RFI: 

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Governments support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no later than 31 March 2009. Responses received after 31 March 2009 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place approximately 45 days following the posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.
