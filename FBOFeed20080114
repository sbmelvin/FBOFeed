The FWS needs a computer based training version of the TCE to run on its on-line learning system.  The new CBT will maintain the look and feel of the existing CBTs.  Given the uniqueness of the topic, FWS can use this same new CBT as a part of the existing self-study refresher program.  Since VISTA Training initially developed the format and compliance criteria for the prior programs, the amount of time required to develop the CBT to meet the learning management systems standards would be greatly reduced due to their pre-existing knowledge of the programming format resulting in savings to the government.  Additionally, VISTA is the only company that produces a transportation/load securement video and instructor material that meets FWS standards for field operations.  This CBT would meet FWS policy requirements for load securement training.  This is a sole source contract with a one-time fixed fee.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) PROGRAM 2008.  Small high-technology firms and research institutions are encouraged to jointly submit proposals to DoD for high quality cooperative research and development to solve the defense-related scientific or engineering problems set forth in the solicitation, especially those concepts that also have high potential for commercialization in the private sector.  STTR solicitation 2008 will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR/STTR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on January 22, 2008.   The 2008 STTR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on February 19, 2008 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, March 19, 2008.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal.  Five DoD components will participate in the 2008 solicitation - the Department of the Army; the Department of the Navy; the Department of the Air Force; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).

Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR/STTR website at http://www.dodsbir.net/submission following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.

The purpose of this advertisement is to seek information from property owners willing to provide approximately  1,966 - 2,070  square  feet of rentable office  space using a common area factor of 1.15%.

The U. S. Government's existing lease is expiring and the Government is considering if it would be economically advantageous for the Government to relocate.  In addition to the rental costs, the Government will also factor in costs for moving to a new location including, but not limited to, physical move, tenant improvements, above-standard/specialized alterations/equipment, furniture relocation, telecommunications, and other related costs.  Note that these same costs may not be factored in when evaluating whether it is most advantageous to the Government to remain in the current lease location.   Useable or  occupiable space above must be available for use by tenant for personnel, furnishings and equipment.     A lease is required for a ten (10) year/five (5) year firm term. 

Targeted occupancy date is January 2008 or sooner.   The space must be contiguous and on one floor.  The space must be accessible 24/7.   The space offered  must be well maintained and must meet the General Services Administration's fire, life safety and handicapped accessibility standards. 

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building ownership.

<DESC>The Government  intends to award a sole source contract modification to Raytheon Compnay, Marlborough, MA 01752.  This contract modification shall produce an estimated quantity of two production quality Engineering Development Model (EDM) CSTT Terminal Communications Groups (CGs) for the Zumwalt class ship system.  In addition an anticipated quantity of ten (10) Production Models of the CSTT Terminals is included for the out years (two each year FY10-FY14).  As delivery of the two EDMs is required by October 2009 for integration into the Zumwalt hulls additional funding is also required for engineering support and integration services through FY14.  The NMT CG includes the inboard (below decks) rack-mounted equipment including modem, IF, Baseband, Crypto, and TIA. The requirement for a NMT Zumwalt class ship variant is due to the unique reduced radar cross section design and reduced manning requirement of this ship class.  This variant will be an additional CLIN for the required design modifications to the baseline NMT functionality, which includes required CG changes to interface to the Zumwalt's unique EHF Transmit/Receive Antenna Component (CXEA) "antenna group".  The Zumwalt Class specific CXEA will consist of five (5) antennas instead of the dual antenna capability provided in the baseline NMT.  As a result, the baseline NMT Radio Frequency (RF), antenna acquisition and tracking control interfaces require modifications for compatibility with the Zumwalt CXEA.  Furthermore, the Zumwalt variant has unique reduced manning requirements, and therefore the Zumwalt NMT will be managed differently then the NMT baseline. ************************** Notes 22 & 26 apply.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting white papers and full proposals describing innovative technology concepts to provide Terminal Swimmer Detection and Targeting.  Concepts are required to reacquire, localize, and confirm the classification of a target that has been detected and classified as a possible swimmer or diver by an early warning system.  The environment of interest is primarily permanent Naval installations but could include commercial ports and anchorages in world wide locations.  The targets include free swimmers, open and closed circuit divers, and divers aided by Diver Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs).  Concepts may range from sensor technologies suitable for manned and unmanned vehicles to complete sensor, delivery, and communication systems that would enable a remote operator to investigate contacts in real time without the aid of manned watercraft.  The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts in a realistic environment.  The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2008 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2010 or earlier.  See attachment (BAA) for full description.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research, <BR>Development, and Engineering Command intends to award on a non-competitive basis to BAE Systems, located at 130 DW Highway, Merrimack, NH  03054, a non-commercial, research a nd development contract for the integration of Visual Acquisition Disruptor/Laser Obstacle Avoidance (VAD/LOAS) into the Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasures (DAIRCM) system for intended use in Army aviation systems.  This acquisition will be proc ured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation will be issued. Use of another source would substantially duplicate $12 million and over two years of effort the Government has invested in the DAIRCM system that would not likely be recovered through competition.  The DAIRCM system elements (the baseline system) are currently in development at BAE Systems (multi-band la ser, beam switch technology, beam collimator) under a Navy contract with Army support.  The integration effort will add VAD/LOAS to the existing DAIRCM  multiband laser distribution system to provide multispectral capabilities at a lighter weight and lower  cost than stand-alone systems. Because of the complexity of the system and the current unavailability of a full technical data package since efforts under the Navy contract are on-going, any other source would have a substantial learning curve with a subs tantial risk of delay and duplication of cost.  BAE Systems has expended over two years achieving the existing level of technical maturity of DAIRCM that is suitable for integration and is the only source that has extensive knowledge of this system to effi ciently and correctly integrate the new capability.   Market research indicates that no other known source has a system that is technically mature enough to integrate with VAD/LOAS or has the required knowledge of DAIRCM that would allow production and int egration of an equivalent capability in the timeframe or funding available. The overall period of performance for this contract is 42 months. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541712.  While the Government does not anticipate com petition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that will be considered. Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C, Ken Helms (Contract Specialist), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.Phone numbers for p oint of contact is Ken Helms at (757) 878-5909.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CSTs migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The support for the hardware expires on 10/31/2007.  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is an essential part to CA/CST/II operations.  By extending the support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Network Appliance will provide premium 7x24 hour onsite support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance SAN equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance SAN.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.<BR><BR>Reposted to add line items 3 and 4, and to update serial numbers in line 2.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This BAA is modified to reflect the following changes and information.  The "Dial-A-Reaction" paragraph (technology area 4) in the basic BAA announcement description is hereby replaced in its entirety by the following paragraph: "TASK 4. INSENSITIVE MUNITIONS (IM) TESTING- Testing will be performed using a JLONS-like laser system (provided by the Offerer) to determine the reaction of several types of IM to laser energy.  The Government will be primarily planning and running the test and will provide instrumentation, with the Offeror providing the laser system, laser operation, and the support.  A test range location and cost shall be proposed by the Offeror, but with the option to fund the test range separately if it is a government-owned facility.  NAVEODTECHDIV representatives will meet with the JEOD end-user to determine appropriate ordnance for testing and the end-user will approve the final list of test items.  The list may include (but not limited to) thick and thin shelled IM and insensitive and extremely insensitive high explosive (IHE). Data from previous IM testing will be used to plan the tests to determine which techniques will be used to achieve the desired reactions.  The ability of th!  e system to provide consistent results will be characterized through a combination of measurements including blast characteristics, residual IHE, and laser parameters (including but not limited to flux density on target, beam power, time to disruption, etc.).  If the results prove successful, the data will contribute to TTP generation and the refinement of the IHE requirement for the JLONS.  The proposed effort shall not exceed 6 months from award of contract and the proposed cost shall not exceed $500.000.  Testing is tentatively scheduled for two weeks in early FY09 with the possibility of an optional third week.  Offeror should include the cost per week of testing as part of the cost estimate." All other tasks included in this BAA have been completed.  Task 4 is the only requirement still outstanding.  The deadline for submission of white papers for this effort shall be 30 April 2008. The technical point of contact is Ashley Archibald, 301-744-6858 x266, ashley.archibald@navy.mil.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS MODIFIED TO REFLECT 8(A) SOLE SOURCE

Date Posted:	01/11/2008
		Closing Date:  01/22/2008


The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 339114 and the size standard is 500 employees.

The government intends to award a name brand commercial delivery order to Goldbelt Raven LLC, using the existing ARMEC (Army Research Medical Equipment and Consumables) contract. The requirement is to purchase:  
KODAK RVG 6100 SIZE # 2 (3 EA)  P/N: 6100-SEN2-ONLY, 
KODAK RVG 6100 #1 SENSOR (3 EA)  P/N: 6100-SEN1-ONLY, 
RVG 6100 #2 SHEATHS (1 EA)  P/N: 6100-SHEATH-2, and 
RVG 6100 #1 (1 EA)  P/N: 6100 SHEATH-1 

The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:
Kodak sensors provide digital imagining of dental X-ray?s that can then be globally accessed on the dental digital radiology system (DDRS).  This unique sensor is the cutting edge of technology and improves the efficiency, productivity, and profitability of USAFA dental clinic.  Our requirement is for the sensor that provides an image that is superior to film.

The use of digital radiography will significantly improve the overall quality of care given to our patients.  Film images are instantaneously produced, speeds up clinical diagnosis, decreases patient waiting time, and increases efficiency.  This will eliminate the cost of film and the need for conventional film processing and will decrease chemical hazards (lead & chemistry) as well as hazardous wastes. Kodak is the most versatile integration system on the market with the best image quality.

All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

Any company that feels they can provide an equal product that meets all the government?s requirements as stated above must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 22 January 2008 at 0800 hour Mountain Time.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

Point of Contact is Ronnie Wilkinson, Contract Specialist (719) 333-2965 email: (ronnie.wilkinson@usafa.af.mil) or  alternate Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer (719) 333-3961 email: leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil

5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, 
Tara Petersen

USAFA, CO 80840
Telephone number 719-333-2074
FAX 719-333-9018

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. 
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<CONTACT>Kraig Neer, 937-255-3699
<DESC>This is a link to the all the documents applicable to the F-16 Mission  Training Center (MTC) Follow-On effort.  The RFP number associated with  this effort is FA8621-07-R-6291, and should not be confused with the  Interim Service contract for the F-16 MTC (RFP: FA8621-05-6253). This solicitation notice is updated as of 14 January 2008.  18 June 2007:  The DRAFT SOO and DRAFT SCRD are now attached to this synopsis.  We will  be conducting industry day meetings from 10 Jul 07 through 13 Jul 07.  Please send an email to kraig.neer@wpafb.af.mil to schedule an industry  day question and answer period.  The sessions will be scheduled on a  first-come-first-served basis.  Also, the F-16 MTC team would like to  remind all perspective offerors that they must be a United States owned  company and have the proper Defense Security Service Facility Security  Clearance.  16 July 2007: The Industry Day charts are now attached below.  23 July 07: We have attached AFRL Technical Report,TR98-0058, Display  Collimation and the Perceived Size of Flight Simulator Imagery.  This  report is provided for your information and should be considered part of  the Bidders Library.  15 Oct 07:  The draft SOO and SCRD have been deleted  in preparation for the updated drafts to be posted within the next two  weeks.  23 Oct 07:  The updated draft versions of the SOW and SRD have  been posted.  06 Nov 07: The anticipated release date of the FINAL RFP for  this program is January 2008.  The Government will periodically release  (on PIXS) DRAFT documents that may be included in the solicitation between  now and the FINAL RFP release date.  It is the Government's intention to  release as many pieces of the DRAFT RFP as soon as possible.  The  Government will be conducting a second set of "one-on-one" industry day  meetings from 3 Dec 07 through 7 Dec 07.  Please send an email to  kraig.neer@wpafb.af.mil to schedule an industry day question and answer  period.  The sessions will be scheduled on a first-come-first-served  basis.  14 Nov 07: DRAFT versions of Section M and Section L of the RFP  have been posted below.  Industry Week meetings are intended to ensure  interested bidders have a clear and complete understanding of the  Government's requirements.  "Requirements" in this context reflect the  total RFP requirements for proposal submittal and program execution, not  just the SRD.  The Government is also interested in understanding  Industry's perceptions of the program cost, schedule, and performance  risks associated with the RFP requirements.  Consistent with these two  goals, the Government will entertain suggestions to revise, clarify, or  simplify/streamline the requirements in the RFP documents.  We encourage  the provision of these suggestions in an electronic form in advance of the  Industry Week meetings, with the intent of facilitating productive  discussions during the meetings.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is issuing a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for the Conference Exhibit Support Services. The purpose of this DRFP is to solicit industry comments and questions on the proposed requirement prior to issuing the final RFP.  Questions/comments are strongly encouraged from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRFP, including requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approach.  Potential offerors are requested to identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements.  The MDA will accept questions/comments on the DRFP up to and including the day of January 28, 2008.  All contractual and/or technical questions shall be submitted in writing (e-mail) to Elizabeth Hoshaw at Elizabeth.Hoshaw@mda.mil.  Telephone questions are not acceptable.  Industry input to the DRFP will be considered in formulating the final RFP.  The Government is not requesting proposals in response to this DRFP, does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the DRFP, or to pay for any information received regarding the DRFP.  The anticipated release date for the final RFP is on or about February 19, 2008 with an anticipated offer closing date of on or about March 19, 2008.  The firm date for receipt of proposals will be stated in the final RFP. 

This requirement is restricted as a Total Small Business Set Aside and will be procured in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) category for this requirement is 541613, Marketing Consulting Services, with a size standard of $6.5 million.  All responsible sources qualifying as small businesses under the above mentioned NAICS Code may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

This requirement is for domestic and international venues beginning in 2008 with a potential period of performance through 2012 for the Public Affairs (PA) Directorate.  The support consists of producing and maintaining exhibits and providing on-site public relations support to help MDA illustrate and communicate the major milestones and strategic objectives of the Ballistic Missile Defense System and its capabilities. Exhibit support activities include, but are not limited to, exhibit design, graphic design, strategic communications, photo gathering, exhibit fabrication, exhibit repairs, event analysis and selection, procuring exhibit space, transporting exhibit to events (both CONUS and OCONUS), coordinating all customs requirements, installing complete exhibit at events, developing audio and video presentations, storing exhibits both in CONUS and abroad in an insured facility and developing print handouts. 

The current exhibit inventory allows for approximately 12 different layouts and configurations ranging in size from 100 sq ft to 600 sq ft. (A full listing of the Government Furnished Equipment will be provided with the Request for Proposal.)  It incorporates an advanced sound system, video projection, plasma and LCD monitors, and theatrical lighting. The Contractor will be required to maintain and repair this inventory to include mishaps, breaks, and malfunctions and resolve unforeseen circumstances that arise in the field or during transport, and is expected to have an alternate plan of action for emergency situations. In addition, exhibit support shall include on-site management and public relations. The exhibit shall be manned at all hours during an event by person(s) who are knowledgeable concerning MDA programs, recent achievements and future goals and has excellent communication skills in order to answer technical questions from a wide spectrum of audiences, i.e., students, engineers, US Flag Officers from all military branches, and international diplomats and military officers.  The exhibit also requires the availability of technical expertise capable of providing on-site trouble-shooting support to identify and repair operational problems that may arise with exhibit displays and equipment used at the exhibit event.

The current list of scheduled events for 2008 and beyond includes approximately 16 events (both domestic and international), but could increase by two to three additional events each year.

Minimal Qualifications:  

- Four year Bachelors Degree (Key Personnel).
- Knowledge and experience with  Missile Defense systems; 
- Recent and relevant experience within the last three (3) years in the following areas:
- Exhibit planning and public affairs/public relations;
- Developing exhibit strategies;
- On-site event support;
- International and domestic shipping techniques and options, electrical standards and customs requirements. 
- Experience managing and maintaining multiple exhibit configurations.
-SECRET clearance at contract award (interim clearances are not acceptable).

The anticipated contract type is Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Fixed Price, Level of Effort (LOE) with Cost Reimbursable CLINs for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) to include travel, shipping costs, drayage fees, etc.  The base contract period of performance will be eight months with four, twelve month options.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government anticipates using the following evaluation criteria for award:

1.	Technical
2.	Past Performance
3.	Management
4.	Cost/Price

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

The Government may use support contractor personnel to assist in the competitive process and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this requirement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information, and the identity of their companies will be disclosed in the final RFP.

The solicitation and all documents related to this procurement are available on Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeds), website http://www.fedteds.gov, using the solicitation number HQ0006-08-R-0001.

The coverage must include Boulder Colorado and Washington DC in North America and areas in Europe including the United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden, Spain and Italy.  Ku-band Europe to Europe service must also be available on the same satellite.  The provider must be able to demonstrate a time transfer stability of 100 picoseconds with one day of averaging using the Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) technique as measured with the standard statistic of Time Deviation (TDEV).  The provider must also demonstrate a long-term time transfer accuracy of 1 nanosecond.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government?s requirements as stated above may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>Part II for final posting of questions and response for RFQ-TX-08-00024 - Leadership Development Program - 

58. Please explain the statement on page nine regarding ?contractor may be required to work more than 40 hours per week.  In some of the training sessions there are some class room activities that take place outside of the normal training hours of 8 am?5 pm. For example group discussions, special activity such as leadership building exercises and watching movies on leadership and evaluating the e the movie.  Other activity may require the contractor to meet with individuals and give them feedback on their performance in class.  

? Will the contractor be asked to work normal office hours or is the essence of the contract a series of training weeks (pg. 40)?  Generally the contractor will be required to work some hours beyond 40 hours, especially during the first training week and the last training week.  For the most part there will be 5 training weeks spread out over 12-18 months.  Training days will start at 8 am and end by 5 pm.

59. It seems that the proposal is asking for a fixed price (Instructions to Vendors, cover page). On page 14 of the Statement of Work, it asks for ?a labor-hour quote with a ceiling price for this requirement.? Please explain. Contractor shall submit their costs for each training session as well as travel expenses and give a total cost for the training. 
60. On page 13, what is the ?Representative Sample of LDP Curriculum and Guides/Manuals? Representative sample refers to a leadership development program that your company developed and implemented.
61. Should I submit two copies (pg. 16, Statement of Work) or five copies (cover page of Instructions to Vendors)? Please submit 5 copies.

62. The SOW mentions that the LDP Participants ?will be divided up into three teams or more and will work on team projects that are a direct benefit to the Agency or our stakeholders.? Is this part of the LDP requirements for the selected contractor to coordinate?  EPA will be responsible for dividing up the participants into three teams.    The selected contractor will help the participants coordinate and monitor their progress on their team projects.  Senior staff will give the teams ideas for team projects.


63. Part Two of the SOW it indicates the participants will participate in a 12-18 month program (LDP).  Though ?Attachment III and the Table of Deliverable by Task? show the Final Assessment within 200 days of awarding the contract? Please explain as 200 days would be only about 7-months.  This is an error.  The final assessment of participants and final progress report of the LDP shall be completed 30 days after the final training session.

64. Attachment III of the SOW it details ?training curriculum overview? by ?training weeks?? does this mean the training is expected to occur over five separate weeks or does the term ?training weeks? equate to overview themes for the separate modules? The leadership training course is a 5 week training course that is spread out over 12-18 months.   
65. What level of travel to Dallas would you anticipate for this project - approximately how many visits and for how long?  The contractor will be required to attend at least 2-3 meetings in Dallas to an assessment of the participants. These assessments or meetings will vary from 2-4 hours. The contractor will make at least 5 trips to Dallas to teach the 5 week sessions.  Hours of training range from 8 am ? 5 pm.  There may be occasions where the training may go from 8 am?7 pm.
66. What length and format is expected for the actual face-to-face delivered training, please? (For example: Two sessions of two days each for 25 participants per session, held offsite at the XYZ Conference Center)  Similarly, are there matching requirements for face-to-face follow-up?  Training week sessions range from 3- 5 days and average 30-40 hours per week.  Face to face sessions or meetings with senior staff will vary fr

<DESC>FINAL POSTING OF RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FOR RFQ-TX-08-0024 FOR THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

                                                 

 1.  What is the name of the company that developed the training for the LDP that was conducted in 2007?  Dow Management Institute

2.  Is there an incumbent for this new project?  If yes, do you intend to work with them? 

Yes there is an incumbent for this new project.  The government has no way of knowing if the incumbent intends to bid on this proposal.   The procurement process requires that we advertise the RFQ and evaluate all bidders equally and fairly.  The government encourages us to looks for vendors that can provide services at the best value.  

 3.  On page 4 of the Statement of Work you state: "Selected contractors will be expected to lead the training that was developed for the LDP that was conducted in 2007.  The contractor will provide the instructor materials, integrate each block of instruction into an effective program and present training on the materials that has been developed.  The selected contractor will be expected to delve more deeply into the learning areas of the course and provide supplemental courses that address current and emerging needs in the management and leadership areas."  
 
Are we to understand that this means that the chosen contractor will be providing program instructors/facilitators to conduct workshops that you already have the rights to use, AND THEN we will also be providing the EPA with supplemental workshops/ workshop materials? If not, could you please clarify this.  The chosen contractor will be responsible for providing their own facilitators and trainers for the training and provide supplemental material to enhance the learning objectives. 
 
4.  On page 16 of the statement of work you note that you would like 2 copies of the proposal but on the "Instructions to Vendors" it is noted that you would like an original plus 4 copies.  Could you clarify how many copies are required? Please provide original plus 4 copies of your proposal.
 
5. Can we expect to see answer to these and other questions by the end of this week 1/11/08?  If not, would it be possible to extend the due date of this RFQ so that vendors may have the appropriate time required to digest the answers to these questions and then tailor our proposals accordingly?  We have received several questions related to this RFQ and we will try and post the answers to the questions as soon as they are available.

6. What government pricing schedule/labor categories should be used to price the proposal? The bid for this RFQ is open to everyone and there are no requirements or request for government pricing schedule for this contract.

7. On page 4 of the RFP states, ?Selected contractors will be expected to lead the training that was developed for the LDP that was conducted in 2007.  The contractor will provide the instructor materials, integrate each block of instruction into an effective program, and present training on the materials that has been developed.  

o	What training courses were conducted?  See Page 20 of the SOW
o	Who conducted these courses? Walt Childress of DMI
o	Who developed these courses?  Walt Childress of DMI 
o	How often are these courses to be delivered? Varies from 2-4 months
 
8. Does the EPA have a curriculum plan/maps or overall vision of scope of subject matter areas for frontline supervisors? Our goal is to have all first line supervisors and mid managers go through this program.  

o	Number of end users per course 25-30
o	Number of modules per course Varies from 2-4
o	Number of courses 5
o	Length of each course Varies from 3-5 days

o	Number of end users per course See answer above
o	Number of modules per course See answer above
o	Number of courses See answer above
o	Lengthom 2-4 hours.

67. Can we access any reports on past efforts in this arena, their results, and analysis of gaps and future needs please?  (If you or colleagues have written any such reports, for example, or given any relevant conference presentations, we would be keen to see them. LDP 1 is ongoing.  Data gaps and analysis will be generated at the completion of the course.   

68.   Since the RFP states the need to use the same program content as used in 2007, when will that content be available so that it can be integrated into a 2008 program?  The incumbent is in the process of putting the material together.  We hope to have the material ready for the selected contractor within the next few months.

69.  Are there instructor guides prepared already of the material that was delivered in 2007? As stated earlier the incumbent is in the process of putting that material together.

70.  Is there a desire to keep the 2007 program in tack and in the same order as delivered in 2007 or can modules be moved around to accommodate the competencies identified for the 2008 participants in their initial 360 assessments?  Our goal is to work with existing material and make modifications to the training course if the contractor has material that can enhance the training.  
 
71.  If there is already a 360 tool to be used, does it adequately measure the 20 + competencies and demonstration of leadership values stated in the RFP?  Yes there is a 360 tool be used in house by the Agency.  The 360 tool measure the competencies called Stockcar: Service, Taking Initiative, Open Communication, Commitment (Vision and Values), Knowledge, Character, Accountability, Risk Taking and Innovation.
72.   Does the program expectation allow for breakout modules so that participants who are assessed as lacking in specific competencies may take the modules that address those competencies and reap the benefits of focused training?  Generally that will be discovered during the initial assessment of the candidate?s FDP and reviewing their assessment survey and their 360 survey.  Breakout modules should cover a variety of competencies to address the entire class.
73.  Are there modules developed to teach the agency specific aspects of leadership outlined in the Scope of Work- specifically, HR Management (PARs & EEO) and Entrepreneurship & Vision- (300 Day Plan, Eco Region)?  As stated in the SOW these are subject areas that we expect the contractor to be experienced with.  There have been no modules in LDP 1 developed to teach these objectives.
74.  I am writing regarding the subject requirement; I?m trying to find out if this is a new requirement or if an incumbent exists?  If there is someone performing / performed this requirement could you please provide any of the following information:

Contractor: Dow Management Institute
Contract Number: Can not be disclosed
Award / Expiration Date: March 2008
Contract Value: Can not be disclosed

75.  How many have applied or are expected to apply for program? Currently we have approximately 15-20 supervisors on the waiting list for the 2nd LDP training.  We are expecting to fill the next class with approximately 24-30 candidates.

76.  How do we review the materials that were presented in previous years?  The material will be made available for your review if you are selected for the contract.
77.  Are the presentation materials for the oral presentation due at the same time as the written proposal? Please do not submit your oral presentation with this RFQ. You will be notified to present an oral presentation if your RFQ is deemed best qualified.

How should other incidentals be submitted (eg. Development time, meetings, reporting time, etc.) There should be very little or no cost associated with developmental time due to the fact that the course has been developed.  EPA will allow for some modifications if the course can be enhanced.  All other incidental expenses should be included in the overall cost for the training.  Please give a detailed break out for those expenses.

45. I have a question regarding the solicitation for the Leadership Development Program for Managers.  I'd like to confirm that the vendor will be training on the material that was developed for the program last year, as opposed as furnishing other material that the vendor uses.  I'm confused about this because I'm not sure how a potential vendor would get familiar with the material developed last year.  Am I misunderstanding?  No there is no misunderstanding, you are correct that the vendor will be training on the material that was developed for the current LDP.  That is why we ask the vendors to furnish a copy of their leadership development program that they have developed so that we can compare the training with the current training we have in place.  EPA will allow for some modification of the existing training so that the vendor?s training program can compliment or enhance the training that is in place. 

46. Will the program be conducted in a residential facility?i.e., will participants stay overnight?  The program will be conducted off site away from the office.  Participants will stay overnight during the first week session and possibly the last session.   

47. The Statement of work indicates that a program has already been designed and that the selected contractor will deliver it.  Is that accurate?  Yes that is correct.  The contractor may modify the existing curriculum by adding some of their own leadership training material if it can enhance the existing training.

48. If this program was conducted in the past, can you share evaluation information with the Contractor either pre or post award?  The incumbent has completed 4 training sessions and the final training session is scheduled to be completed in March 2008.  All of the training sessions have received evaluations above 4.0 on a 5.0 scale.

 49. What is meant by the requirement that the Contractor delve more deeply into the material?  The contractor may use additional materials such as case studies, guest speaker or unique exercises to create a greater understanding of the topic.  

Is this a design requirement that should be priced separately? No this is not a design requirement that should be priced separately.

50. Where will the training be held?  The training will be held offsite within the Dallas Fort /Fort Worth area.  


51. Does the coaching have to be conducted onsite? EPA will provide the coaches for the participants but the feedback will be given by the consultant.  Feedback will be given in written format and privately to the individual when on site.

52. How many people will need to be coached? Contractor will not be responsible for coaching the participants.  Contractor will be required to give feedback to all of the participants in the class.  EPA will be responsible for providing coaches for the participants 

53.  The "Instructions to Vendors" page refers to pages 13-16 of the SOW for information regarding the technical proposal.  However, the RFQ only contains 12 pages, as posted at http://yosemite1.epa.gov/R6/R6W3C2.nsf/RFQNumber/F158FACC6630F056862573BE006EB31C/$File/RFQ-TX-08-00024.pdf?OpenElement 

Question:  How can I obtain the complete RFQ?      You have a complete RFQ.  The RFQ is only 12 pages.  The RFQ is asking that you fill in boxes from 13-16.  The SOW instructions are on page 13-16.

54.  The RFQ refers to a "base year" and two "option years".  Option Year 1 is defined in the RFQ as "1 Feb 08 - 31 Jan 2009", and Option Year 2 is defined as "1 Feb 2009 - 31 Jan 2010". 

Question:  Please clarify the Base Year and Option Years of the contract   The base year is the first year of the contract and the option year is the second year of the contract if EPA decides to fund the second year.

55. Is the contract for 12 months or 18 months (with option to renew for another year)? The Instructions for Vendors says 12 months, the Statement of Work, pg. 9 says up to 18 months.  The SOW says the program is for 12-18 months.  EPA wanted to give the vendor the flexibility to be able to complete the training in that time frame.  The current LDP training is scheduled for 18 months.  The problem with a 12 month schedule that it does not give the participants enough flexibility to absorb the material and to engage tin special projects which are part of the course. 

56. On page four of the Instructions for Vendors, I read ?Selected contractors will be expected to lead the training that was developed for the LDP that was conducted in 2007.? What is this?  Dow Management Institute developed a leadership development program in 2007.  Vendors who are awarded the contract will use that curriculum and may add their own material or make modifications to the existing material to enhance the 
the training course.    
57. What is the ?Executive Core Qualifications? mentioned on page four?  The Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) define the competencies needed to build a federal corporate culture that drives for results, serves customers, and builds successful teams and coalitions within and outside the organization. The Executive Core Qualifications are required for entry to the Senior Executive Service and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for management and executive positions.
58. Please explain the statement on page nine regarding ?contractor may be required to work more than 40 hours per week.  In some of the training sessions there are some class room activities that take place outside of the normal training hours of 8 am?5 pm. For example group discussions, special activity such as leadership building exercises and watching movies on leadership and evaluating the e the movie.  Other activity may

<DESC>In response to the sources sought dated 10 Jan 08, the current COMETS contract is a multiple award contract. The Government may award a follow-on mulitiple award contract. Therefore, when selecting your teaming arrangements, due to possible Organizat ional Conflicts of Interest and potential for decreased task order competition after award, cross-teaming is prohibited. Cross-teaming arrangements include a prime offeror participating as a subcontractor/team member with another prime contractor, or team member/subcontractor subcontracting/teaming with more than one prime contractor. Following contract award, awardees shall ensure any changes/additions to team members or first tier subcontractors abide by this cross-teaming prohibition.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR>The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Advanced Wound Care products.  This product line consists primarily of products with sizes  documented in Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process of this announcement.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically prefe rred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Cente r, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army He alth Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additi onal information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three  (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of  a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF prefere nce and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the  category of Advanced Wound Care, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,005,501.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a r ecent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: (1) Transparent Dressings: sizes- 4x4? , 5?x4, 3?x3 3/8, 2 3/8x2?, 4x5 7/8, 2x1?, 11x16, 11x4, 6x8, 5?x10, 4x8 totaling $537,804.52 purchased, (2) Silver Dressings: sizes- 5x 12, 1x24, 4x66, 16x16, 4x5, 4x8, 24x24, 8x16, 10x12, 6x108 totaling 354,967.50 purchased, (3) Hydrocolloid Dressings: sizes- 6x8, 4x4.7,4x4, 2x2 3/8, 6x6, 1?x1?  totaling $48,883.73 purchased, (4) Hydrogel Dressings/Fillers: sizes- 6x6, 4x4, 8x8, tubes- ?oz, 1oz totaling $14,218.03 purchased, (5) Foam Dressings: sizes- 3?x3?, 4x4?, 5 5/8 x5 5/8, 7?x8?, 5 5/8x6 1/8, 5?x5? totaling $8,128.72 purchased, (6) Alginate Dressings: sizes- 2x2, 4x4, 4x8, 12in rope totaling $3,634.25 purchased.  (All sizes noted above are expressed in inches unless otherwise identified.)  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company criteria below.  <BR ><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informatio n, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company na me and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participation.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the p otential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived a t the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evalu ation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in thi s announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (base d on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made duri ng the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors will respond to this FBO an nouncement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/ provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.    After r eview of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.< BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subj ect medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or service s; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the region (vendors whose  products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disquali fied); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the sta ndardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.

Alginate Dressings:  Sizes 2x2, 4x4, 4x8, 12in rope.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the p rocess of applying for a DAPA number for the Advanced Wound Care product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a D APA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV (currently, Europes PV is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not avail able through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.) <BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Your company must be able to send samples to this region by United States Postal Service (USPS).  This  form of mailing has proven to be the best at eliminating delays due to International Customs.   <BR>7.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices .  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Advanced Wound Care products including dates, durat ion, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  Your company must provide history of back orders and/or recalls for the Advanced Wound Care products, which will include: dates, duration, cause, and resolution (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>9.	For any Advanced Wound Care products containing medication, vendors must provide products with FDA approval for use in all clinical advanced wound care settings and  provide literature to support this requirement (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>10.	Vendors must provide a statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) clearly labeled as latex free/safe.<BR>11.	Vendors must supply a statem ent demonstrating instructions/directions for use with each unit of issue and provide evidence of this with their initial submittals.<BR>12.

Your company is required to provide literature support showing the mechanism that ensures normal bacteria of the wound and the promotion of wound healing.<BR>14.	Vendors must provide visual examples demonstrating product labels with visible expiration dates of at least 12 pt fonts on all exterior, intermediate and individual packaging and provide evidence of such (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process:  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature and/or samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using both a literature review and hands on evaluation in a non -clinical setting.  As indicated in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Eur ope Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Literature will be e-mailed or shipped via the same procedure as samples.  Vendors will be given 10 calendar days to ship  samples.  Literature and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 4:00PM EST on the 10th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Ven dors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acce ptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically accep tability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.   <BR> <BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will ev aluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in an inpatient setting, if needed.<BR><BR>The follo wing Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.00  <BR><BR>Hydrocolloid Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing may be cut to required size.<BR>2.	Skin remains i ntact when dressing is removed.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to skin without rolling edges.<BR>4.	Dressing molds around uneven surfaces.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a long wear time before required change.<BR>Silver Produc ts:<BR>1.	Dressing may be cut to required size.<BR>2.	Dressing does not cause a local adverse reaction.<BR>3.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>4 .	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing is an effective barrier against a wide range of microbes.<BR>Transparent Film Dressings:<BR>1.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>2.	Dressing is available in different sizes.<BR>3.	D ressing allows removal in one piece.<BR>4.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit and shaped to cover difficult anatomical areas.<BR>5.	Literature supports the use of dressing with other topical medications.<BR>6.	Dressing does not have an adhesive that irritates skin .<BR>7.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a high vapor transfer ability to reduce maceration of surrounding skin.<BR>Hydrogel Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing allows visualization of wound.<BR>2.	Dressing can be removed in one piece.<B R>3.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit.<BR>4.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing allows for moisture vapor permeability.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing can be used with topical medications.<BR>Alginate Dress ings:<BR>1.	Dressing maintains its integrity when wet.<BR>2.	Dressing is removed from wound without irritating skin.<BR>3.	Dressing is soft and conformable.<BR>4.	Dressing is highly absorbent when it comes in contact with wound exudates.<BR>Foam Dressings: <BR>1.	Dressing can be cut without compromising its function.<BR>2.	Dressing can be shaped to cover difficult anatomical areas.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to wound bed.<BR>4.	Dressing remains intact when saturated.<BR><BR>Market Search Request for Information:   Our clinicians are attempting to stay abreast of technological advances in this product line.  None of the information provided based on the following feedback will be used to determine technical or clinical acceptability. Please describe any features th at your products possess that use new design or technology.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process:  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical thr eshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data ba sed on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided ten (10) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 10th  calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate q uotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company fa ctors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1) Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region (Post-Standardization Costs), 2) Potential Cost Avoidance , 3) Impact of unmatched lines, and 4) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing elem ents.<BR><BR>

Vendors a re required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Hal liday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward a verification of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale of one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable, two is equal to minimally acceptable, three is equal to acceptable, four is equal to most acceptable, and five is equal to highly a cceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has set a 3.00 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.00 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. <BR><BR>Phase III:  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region.  Qualifying vendors will be given ten (10) business days to provide the TRBO their pricing proposals by email in a prescribed format.  Vendors failing to provide their pricing proposals by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when  combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically equal, price will become more important.  Pric ing will be evaluated based on best value to the government.  Pricing proposals are to be founded on a committed volume for a two-year base period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.  Vendors that fail to offer an  incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  <BR><BR>1.

<DESC><BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwe st Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Lancets.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a b est value determination for safety lancets that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE. <BR><BR>The maj or facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. CEN TCOM.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing A greement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow the Prime Vendor to distribute their items. This is a su pplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 m onths) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated completion date for this initiative is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.<BR>  <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, 011-49-6221-172109, m arcee.whisenant@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Lancets.  The estimated total annual volume for this product line in the Europe Region for this is $92,59 7. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. <BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide product support to sites if requested, educational resources and tools for clinical use  of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in  participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil  Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  All interested offerors are to provide electronic e-mail responses. <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electr onic responses to technical criteria, for providing samples and complete product literature at no charge for clinical evaluation purposes, and for submission of  electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the above POC for the Europe Region TRBO that its initial submission, quote, and literat ure actually arrived at the Europe Region TRBO via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmissions before the due date/time should a problem occur with the first submission.  As stated above, vendors t hat fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.<BR><BR>D.	 Source Selection Procedures.<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region.  They are the decision makers for this initiative.<BR><BR>Phase I:  Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the criteria.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.  All technical/company criteria are equally weighted.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those qualified vendors who meet the criteria will be i nvited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. <BR><BR>Phase II:  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The CPT determined that this product line would be evaluated using both a literature review and a hands on evaluation in a non-clinic al setting.  As a result, literature review materials and samples for this product group will be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship literature and samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Literature and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST by the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Servic e Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR> Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward a verification of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria usin g a Likert scale of one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable, two is equal to minimally acceptable, three is equal to acceptable, four is equal to most acceptable, and five is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are we ighted equally. The CPT has set a 3.00 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.00 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. <BR><B R>Phase III:  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold will be asked to submit their bes t pricing offer based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region.  Qualifying vendors will be given ten (10) business days to provide the TRBO their pricing proposals by email in a prescribed format.  Vendors fa iling to provide their pricing proposals by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly m ore important than cost or price.

Background

The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is an interagency task force, chaired by the Department of Commerce.  It was created in 1992 to coordinate the export promotion and export finance activities of the U.S. Government.  One of the chief duties of the TPCC is to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses.  

The TPCC?s 2002 National Export Strategy Report to Congress called on the trade promotion agencies to develop a training program to improve customer service by strengthening interagency cooperation and client management.  Prior research indicated that customer service would improve if trade promotion staff in each agency had a more sophisticated understanding of the programs of other agencies and how they interrelate.  

Based on these identified needs and priorities, the TPCC created the Interagency Trade Officer Training Program in 2003, conducting three four-day sessions that year with the support of temporarily assigned staff and a contractor. The TPCC will continue developing the curriculum and to organize and facilitate three training sessions. The program was extended through 2008 with an award and subsequent exercise of two option year renewals.  The TPCC plans to continue this training given strong support from TPCC member agencies and strong participant feedback.  

Objective

The purpose of this Work is to prepare government business assistance representatives, both managers and staff, to accurately and holistically gauge their customers? needs in relation to the changing global marketplace and the full array of federal export promotion programs and services that are available.  By doing so, Government can improve customer referrals, coordination of programs, and the leveraging of resources toward cross-governmental trade promotion priorities. A dynamic training program can also improve communication between the trade promotion agencies and working relationships between government trade assistance staff. 

All responsible sources with the technical capabilities to meet the above requirements, may submit their Point of Contact/email address for the Proposers List via email to Juanita Beck at juanita.beck@noaa.gov , no later then January 18, 2008 by 12:00 P.M. noon Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only, with specific interest in small business capability.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions).  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services in support of Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), PAFB, Colorado.  A broad range of technical and analytical advisory and assistance and systems engineering and technical assistance shall be provided under this contract to include support or improvement of policy development, management, administration and improvement of systems operations.  This requirement shall also consist of several phases of planning, programming, acquisition, and implementation cycles of various Government systems to complement the Government?s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.  In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, and training services.  Work under this contract will require security clearances.  For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-08-R-9000 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.  Work performed under the current HQ AFSPC contract will be accessible at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website.  It is anticipated the contract performance period will be a base period of five years with no option periods, and the program?s ceiling value will be approximately $400 million. Most of the work is expected to be performed on PAFB.  The Government is contemplating award of a multiple award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and cost type contract line item numbers (CLINs).  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. No decision has yet been made regarding the small business strategy for this contract.  However, in anticipation of addressing bundling issues, the Government is specifically assessing the availability and potential of small business to perform this work.  Small business is advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor alone.  Small businesses wishing to influence the Contracting Officer?s decision regarding small business set-asides are urged to respond to this announcement via e-mail to jamie.dufrene@peterson.af.mil with a courtesy copy to jeane.steed@peterson.af.mil.  Please provide your Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number; a brief description of your company?s business size and status (i.e., HUBZone, woman/veteran/service disabled veteran/native American/minority-owned); and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number and e-mail address.  Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this notice or any follow-up information requests is voluntary and shall be treated as confidential.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing at this website, FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.  It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR  52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  Additionally, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 52.204-8, Annual Representations and Certifications, offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov .   Please provide responses by 22 January 2008.  Any questions may be addressed via e-mail to jeane.steed@peterson.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Combat Convoy Mission Rehearsal Tool (CCMRT)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-AFAMS-1

<CONTACT>Jane Waller, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4017, Fax 407-380-4164, Email jane.waller@navy.mil - Lavenji Daniels, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4762, Fax null, Email lavenji.daniels@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), in support of the Air Force and the Navy, is considering development of a competitive acquisition strategy to provide United States armed forces personnel the capability to participate in massive multi-user, first-person perspective mission rehearsal for combat convoy missions over the web, using Internet Explorer as the client software.  The target implementation environment is Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and will be initially deployed on GCSS-Air Force (GCSS-AF).

The United States armed forces is interested in acquiring CCMRT to provide skills retention/enhancement training of all mission critical tasks/tactics, techniques, & procedures (TTP)/doctrine related to convoy operations, available to all military personnel over the services' portals (using GCSS).  The Air Staff plans to establish a 24/7 server cluster within the Air Force network, which will host the system and provide interoperability and connectivity with other simulations and training systems.  The software must be modular and provide tools for user community modification of scenarios, heuristics, evaluation criteria, and asset data (art, behavior, and physics/ballistics data for maps, terrain, structures, avatars, vehicles, equipment, weapons, etc).   The goal is to build upon the framework used for this system to provide mission rehearsal or simulation capability for any Agile Combat Support role performed in the first-person, starting with a prototype combat convoy mission rehearsal tool as the initial application on the framework, with full GCSS-AF integration (Level IV), and with complete editing and intelligent tutoring capabilities.  This begins with producing a proof of concept that can utilize a current standard Air Force computer as a web-server within a base's enclave (domain) to run the simulation for a limited number of clients within the enclave and include limited editing tools.  The proof of concept must also be used on the GCSS-AF test range to assess GCSS-AF and typical Air Force NIPERNET lag/latency/bandwidth constraints and demonstrate the concept through the Air Force Portal.  This approach is designed to build full capability while delivering interim capabilities to users parallel to the development of advanced capabilities and for the certification and accreditation process.  


The four individual elements of the CCMRT are as follows:  

a.  Web client user application:   

a.1.  Functionally, the client will provide the user a full-screen, first-person perspective simulation of dismounted and mounted operations for mission execution (similar to a first-person shooter game), yet also have capability to use simulated maps, briefing aids, and other mission planning and after action review tools in the third-person.  It will allow users to control simulated equipment ranging from vehicles, weapons, computers, communications/radios, blue force trackers, and ISR feeds.  It will allow users to perform any role in a convoy team and switch roles on the fly, if necessary, and also allow users to perform roles of neutral civilians and enemy forces.  Ideally, it will allow users to communicate with each other by voice, realistically simulating physical proximity, intercoms, and radios.  Initially an alternate, simplified communication method will be required to capture graded events, until the software can assess user performance by interpreting the speech recognition data.  The client will be scalable all the way from a single human participant operating with, against, and being evaluated by the computer, up to large teams operating with each other and training against human-controlled entities, and evaluated by humans.  It must produce an engaging experience; the user-interface must allow real-time completion of required tasks.  The default sequence of events will be mission planning, mission execution, and after action review.

a.2.  Technically, the client user application must operate in a military enterprise computing environment and be executable by users with minimal or no support required from Information Technology support staffs (personnel with admin rights on the local machine).  It must meet DoD and service requirements for accreditation and certification, as well as be compatible with restraints such as Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration compliance.  The client will provide an interface between the user, the server, and other users.  It will render 3-D graphics and stereo audio, perform physics modeling for moving entities, collect user inputs from the keyboard, mouse, and microphone, and relay to the server.   A mixture of 2-D and 3-D graphics can be used (i.e., vehicle interiors can be represented in a 2-D 360 degree panorama (with a different vantage point for each position in the vehicle), while exteriors are viewed through the vehicle windows in 3-D.  Client will store simulation engine coding, physics models, and terrain/entity artwork and characteristics on the local machine.  A modular approach will be used so that this data may be updated automatically each log-in or as required.  Essentially, this node will serve as a graphics engine and communications interface.  It will rely on the server to relay state data on the other entities, and will render the appropriate graphics according to the user's perspective (i.e., display entities within visual line-of sight of the user).  It should take no longer than 30 minutes to perform initial execution of mobile code and data, assuming a 100kb/s or better connection.  Code and data should persist on local machine and be accessible to all users so subsequent execution should take no more than 5 minutes for any user on that machine.

a.3.  Client user application minimum computer requirements:  Client software will be Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC)-compliant and ideally will require minimal or no administrator support for initial setup and no administrator support for content updates.  Graphics will run at a minimum resolution of 800 x 600 (extrapolated to full screen mode) with at least a 20 FPS refresh rate.  Minimum client software/hardware requirements are Windows XP SP2, DirectX 9, Internet Explorer 6 (but forward compatible to Vista, DirectX 10, and Internet Explorer 7) running on at least a Pentium iii 1.0ghz with on board 3-D graphics, 16mb dedicated or shared video RAM and 256mb system RAM.  A low-cost headset may be required if the client machine lacks adequate built-in 2-way audio.   Client will require broadband connection.  Users will authenticate with their DoD Common Access Cards (CAC) using the Air Force Portal/GCSS-AF's  Reduced Sign On (RSO) function.  Further digital encryption only required for transfer of user metrics.

b.  Web client instructor/editor application.  

b.1.  Functionally, the client instructor/editor application will allow a human instructor to track the execution of a scenario and monitor activities through a scalable perspective ranging from a 2-D bird's eye view of everything happening, down to the actions of any particular user.  It will also allow him to assemble an after action review and present it to the users online.  The instructor/editor application will also provide a highly intuitive, powerful suite of editing tools.  These tools must empower trusted Air Force military, civilian, and/or contracted personnel with intermediate computer skills to modify existing (or produce new) scenarios, terrain/entities artwork and characteristics (including physics, AI behaviors, etc.).  It will also allow them to modify heuristics, training criteria, doctrine/TTP models, the Intelligent Tutor model (assessment criteria), and import multimedia.  It will have direct read access to static databases and have the ability to push limited edits directly to selected users on a per-session basis, and/or push edits to a holding area on the server for possible global release by the CCMRT program office.   The program office would also use this application for initial creation of scenarios and assets.

b.2.  Technically, the client instructor/editor application will mirror the constraints of the user application (see paragraph a.2).

b.3.  Client instructor/editor application minimum computer requirements will mirror the constraints of the user application (see paragraph a.3).

c.  Dynamic Server cluster.  

c.1.  Functionally, the dynamic server cluster will require the following capabilities: Execute multiple simultaneous simulation sessions (control the simulation for the clients and perform the resource-intensive operations).  Ability to provide Scenario Control, Behavior Control, Data Collection (user training/performance metrics), Speech Recognition, Assessment (intelligent tutoring/coaching), Feedback (robust automated after action review with team and individual performance assessment), VOIP Hub, Communications (DIS/HLA/SCORM) to allow interoperability with other simulations and learning management systems.  The server will include a website on the Air Force Portal to serve as a "lobby" to schedule sessions, for trainers and supervisors to access detailed user metrics, and to post a "scoreboard" so users can see where they stand with an aggregated, cumulative "score".  

c.2.  Technically, the dynamic server cluster will reside within the GCSS-AF server farm.  It must work around challenges such as lag and latency within the Air Force NIPRNET.  All communications will travel through this hub and spoke topography, there will be no peer-to-peer communications.  System must have capability for constant 2-way data transmission  without incurring lags caused by starting and stopping connections.  User training/performance metrics will require a managed access control scheme to allow only the appropriate supervisors and trainers to view (and export to Excel) users' metrics.  This data must be protected with 128-bit encryption.

c.3.   Dynamic server cluster computer requirements.  Server-side software and hardware must comply with all GCSS-AF level-4 compliance requirements, to include architecture, information assurance accreditation, etc.  See www.gcss-af.com for details.
 
d.  Static data servers.  Data that stays relatively static will be distributed geographically on the ?Edge? using GCSS-AF Akamai edge server technology to speed downloads.  

d.2.  Technically, the static data servers will reside on GCSS-AF Akamai edge servers distributed throughout the Air Force Enterprise.  They will synchronize new content at least daily.

d.3.   Static server cluster computer requirements.  Server-side software and hardware must comply with all GCSS-AF level-4 compliance requirements, to include architecture, information assurance accreditation, etc.  See www.gcss-af.com for details.

Air Staff is interested in several categories of possible solutions for client-side delivery:

a. Browser plug-ins already included in Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) image, e.g., Flash Player 9.0.45.0, Shockwave Player 10.2.0.023, Windows Presentation Framework.

b. ActiveX controls (packaged for SMS installation) to execute DirectX (may be written in XNA, if technically possible).

c. Java (not java script).

d. Browser plug-ins not already included in Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) image.

Air Staff may direct that the software emulate specific functionality of existing simulations and editing tools for inclusion in the prototype and production development.  Additionally, Air Staff may direct the re-use of existing government-owned asset data.  If so, these requirements will be identified in the statement of work and be contingent on government access to the code.  Once identified, these requirements should not change.

Air Staff prefers to purchase an open source solution, maximizing use of open source licensing models.  A mixture of open source and proprietary modules may be necessary, but licensing for the proprietary modules must not be cost-prohibitive against providing web-based access to all users across the Air Force enterprise.  

Air Staff will provide access to combat convoy subject matter experts.

Interested parties should provide a written statement of capability, using the prescribed format (font size 11, Times New Roman); not to exceed ten (10) pages (including cover page), addressing the following:

a.  General capabilities and experience in providing similar simulation systems.

b.  Identification of projected delivery date for proof of concept phase, to include alpha, beta, and code complete versions.

c.  Specific capabilities and experience with thin client/mobile code 3-D graphics, physics modeling (human, vehicles, ballistics, flight), entity artificial intelligence, speech recognition/evaluation, instructor operator stations, machinima, scenario generation, after action review, collective training and concurrency, intelligent tutoring/coaching.

d.  Subcontract management experience and potential teaming arrangements, if any.

e.  Licensing options.

f.  Include the company name, cage code, large or small business and primary point of contact including email address and telephone number.  

g.  It is most critical to provide an alpha release demo within 60 days after contract award and final release of the proof of concept at the earliest possible date. Please address your capability to author software in the most expeditious manner possible and include projected/estimated production time from contract award to first delivery.

Written statement of capabilities should be received by this office NLT COB 30 Jan 08.

The extension to this contract is proposed until December 31, 2008 with one additional option year from January 1 - December 31, 2009.

Over the past three years, Hufano & Associates, LLC has successfully delivered a variety of organizational development projects to AHRQ.  Given the personal nature of individual coaching and personal development, the trusting relationship Hufano has built with AHRQ leaders is an immeasurable benefit.  AHRQ Senior Management desires to continue working with Hufano & Associates to further develop and enhance the performance of AHRQs Senior Management Team.

<DESC>U.S. Coast Guard Group / Air Station Port Angeles, WA is seeking a request for information concerning the availability of a gun/ weapons range pertaining to the information provided.  At this time, we are only requesting information and this is not to be considered a negation for services or a contract for services or materials.  Upon receipt of information the determination shall be made weather to proceed with the formal quote process. This request is Geographically restricted.
A range owner/operator should not be deterred from presenting information or a proposal that does not include all capabilities as long as a fair majority of range requirements can be met.  The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited. 

Range requirements:   Range will need to be ready for use 01 May 08.
1.  Must have the capability to establish 8 firing lines at a distance minimum of 600yds up to 800yds.
2. Must support at least 8 shooting points with at least 6 feet between shooters.
3. Range must be available for day and night operations.  No lighting or electrical hook-ups are required. 
4. Range owner must be willing to establish a regular schedule of range use by Coast Guard (ex. every other Thursday).  The Coast Guard will require two set days each month for shoots.  Scheduled days need to be flexible for weather and/or operational mission changes.  Additional days will likely be needed from time to time for different reasons (prior to Surge Ops, increased threat levels, new personnel, etc.) Range owner will need to establish a set range use price in the contract for these additional days when used.  A request with suitable advance notice will be submitted to the range owner on these occasions.
5. Range cannot be an impact area w/ live ordinance; entire firing line must be safe and accessible by foot/small range vehicle.
6. Range must have a suitable back stop (i.e. earth burm or equivalent) capable of containing rounds up to and including 7.62mm (.308cal) ammunition.  Tracer rounds allowed when no fire hazard exists (ex: tracers might not be allowed when local ?burn ban? in effect).
7. Range must allow laser pointers and aiming lights (ex: PEQ-2 or ATPIAL).
8. Line of fire is free of all obstructions including tall grass, large rocks, uneven ground etc. to the maximum extent possible. 
9. Range must be accessible by car or truck.
10. Range owner/manager is responsible for maintenance of the range; lead removal from the back stop, cutting grass, facilities upkeep etc.  Range users will be responsible for general cleanliness during range days i.e.; picking up spent brass and removal of items utilized at the range.  
11. Range must have or have access to restroom facilities within a reasonable distance to the firing range. 
 Requirement can be met by the use of a portable restroom facility such as a port-o-potty or a facility similar in nature. 

Range preferences:
1. It would be advantageous to have a helicopter pad near range assembly area.  Helo pad can be as rudimentary as an open earthen area.   Helo pad needs to be at least 50'x 50' with approach and departure paths clear of obstructions, i.e. trees, antennas, wires.  Additionally, helo pad could be used for staging area for aerial gunnery (if range aerial gunnery capable).  Helo pad area shall be maintained by range owner.  Pad simply needs to be kept free of obstructions; i.e. tall grass, large rocks, and loose debris.  Placement of helo pad will need to be considered, i.e. high winds, debris generated by rotor wash etc.
2. Prefer a range with Aerial Gunnery capability.  If this is an option, it should be noted as such and with separate cost quote for consideration.  Helo would need to establish a stable 100' hover on the firing line 100-300 yards from target.  Impact area would need to be of sufficient size to contain the safety footprint for 7.62mm (.308cal) ammunition employed from a helo profile previously described.
3. A structure near the firing line that can accommodate 12+ personnel and their range gear.  Something that will keep range personnel comfortable and protected from elements; i.e. sun, wind, rain.  This structure could be as simple as a large tent with multiple picnic tables.  
4. A roof or awning on the permanent firing line.  This structure could be dual purpose and meet the needs noted in previous preference.
Note:  Range need not be elaborate.  Open field with a burm at one end may suffice.  Range owner will be responsible for all aspects of range establishment and operation; Environmental Impact Statements, state/county permits, building permits, lead removal, land clearing/grass cutting etc.

<DESC>This is a request for information.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Charleston (SSCC) is soliciting information seeking solutions for battery power units for use with the Marine Corps Tactical Remote Sensor Systems System-of-System (TRSS SOS).  The TRSS SOS uses hand- emplaced sensors to support the field commanders intelligence collection effort by providing continuous, wide area surveillance of the battlefield. Two battery powered unit configurations are required - one that holds a single BA-5x90/U series battery, and one that houses three BA-5x90/U series batteries.  The Single Battery Power Unit (SBPU) is a lightweight enclosure that houses a single BA-5x90/U series battery to provide 12 VDC power to TRSS SoS devices.  The SBPU has two integrated 13-pin connectors that allow for cable connection to equipment and for daisy-chaining up to three SBPU together to extend the TRSS SOS mission duration.  The SBPU configuration items include the battery box and two cables.  The SBPU includes a data pass through feature that allows data signals to be passed concurrently while power is being supplied.  The Triple Battery Power Unit (TBPU) is a functional equivalent of the SBPU that uses three BA-5x90 batteries. General Delivery Requirements.  The SBPU effort requires the manufacture of up to 2,000 SBPUs, which are built in accordance with a prescribed set of Product Drawings (Qualification and Production only).  The TBPU requires the manufacture of up to 1,000 TBPUs, which are built in accordance with a prescribed system specification (design, qualification, and production). Both battery box efforts also include the delivery of data associated with system design, development, production, and logistics support. Intended Application of Battery Boxes. The battery power units are required to power unattended devices for a minimum of 120 days in outdoor environments within the temperature range of 30 to +62 degrees C.  Two configurations are required - one that holds a single battery, and one that houses three batteries.  The battery boxes are TRSS devices that allow the attachment of external power sources. The systems ability to be lightweight and man-packed to remote locations is essential. The Government desires SBPUs to be built per the existing Product Drawing. Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions for the TBPU, if available, and in compliance with the TBPU specification are required. Industry firms capable of accomplishing the required services, in whole or by teamed effort, are invited to submit an affirmative response to this notice.  The Government is interested in rapid delivery of low- weight solutions that can withstand the environmental requirements, which include a 24-hour immersion threshold.  Partial solutions will not be considered. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued for a Commercial type contract issued under the test procedures of FAR Part 13.5.  The applicable NAICS code is 335931 with a size standard of 500 employees. Firms are invited to submit documentation (any literature, brochures, and references) necessary to support that they possess the required capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements. There is a five-page limitation for all data submitted.  Responses must include the following: (1) name and address of firm; (2) size of business, including: average annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (3) ownership (including Country of Ownership), indicating whether: Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned, HUBZone, Veteran- Owned and/or Service-Disabled- Veteran-Owned Business, and Central Contractor Registration (CCR) information; (4) number of years in business; (5) two points of contact, including: name, title, phone, fax, and e-mail address; (6) DUNS Number; (7) affiliate information:  parent corporation, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential subcontractor) or subcontractors (if potential prime); (8) Product literature in PDF format that identifies the ability to meet the requirements listed above or identify proposed unit that meets all requirements listed above.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, Joanne Banks, Contract Negotiator, at joanne.banks@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>99 -- PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE PROCUREMENT LIST OF Pen, Vista Gel, 1.4 mm Retractable Ballpoint
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.

This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following product to the P/L:
Pen, Vista Gel, 1.4 mm Retractable Ballpoint, NSNs: 7520-00-NIB-1969 (black); 7520-00-NIB-1970 (blue); 7520-00-NIB-1971 (red).  The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
   

Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing 1.4 mm retractable ballpoint pens to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

PAP 89465 ? 1.4 mm ?Profile?		PAP 89466 ? 1.4 mm ?Profile?
PAP 70608 ? 1.4 mm ?Altitude?		PAP 70609 ? 1.2 mm ?Altitude?
PAP 89467 ? 1.2 mm ?Profile?

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing 1.4 mm retractable ballpoint pens GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 8, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>V -- Vendor Information Session - Transportation Services
<DESC>On January 31, 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host a vendor information session to conduct market research on how the government can best acquire transportation services for the GSA?s Global Supply program.  Once this discussion concludes there will be a discussion on how GSA can best secure transportation services for other Federal agencies with significant transportation needs.  3PLs are not being considered to service these customers.  For the Global Supply program, the main driver is to obtain lower costs while maintaining quality service levels, and for other customer agencies, the main goals are to streamline the ordering process while ensuring on-time delivery and quality service levels.

The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order to CACI INC FEDERAL for the technical support for the closeout, retirement, and/or destruction of approximately 3,000 inactive contracts and  purchase/delivery order files in the SDDC-AQ offices in Alexandria, Virginia, prior to the BRAC closure of the office.  The Surface Deployment and Distribution Command intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance  with statutory authority Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplier will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  In accordance with  Justification and Approval number 08-001, a determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because CACI INC FEDERAL is the current contractor providing the acquisition support services to SDDC-AQ, and a call to the current BPA, to include  follow-on support until the BRAC closure, was unable to be processed by the Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE). Due to this, a stand-alone contract for the continuing acquisition support is being developed to complete the final phase of the BRAC closu re.  This stand-alone contract is necessary to meet mission requirements. Period of Performance is 26 January 2008 to 30 September 2008. The close out of this Sole Source notification will be January 18, 2008 at 1400Hrs EST.  Questions should be directed t o Sue Kinsey via email no later than January 18, 2008 1300 Hrs EST.

<SUBJECT>A--DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED, VARIABLE SPEED REFUEL DROGUE
<DESC>This is a change to referenced pre-solicitation notice.  Anticipated RFP  release date is changed from 15 January 2008 to ?to be determined (TBD)?.  A firm date will be posted to this site upon a firm date being  established. VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of  their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD)  candidate.  A potential offeror?s participation is strictly voluntary and  a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the government?s  future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the  government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides  not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in  the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a  tentative date and is subject to change. A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If  the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to  the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The  offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific  drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue  demonstration and no other. The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offeror?s safety  restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing  to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of  flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data,  flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical  interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be  responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the  existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror  will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the  configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The  government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on  complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that  will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified  condition. 2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing The offeror shall: Submit to the government (see below address) by COB 24 January 2008 the  following documents:    	(a) 	Flight safety certificates 	(b)	Flight instructions and limitations 	(c)	Pod modification or maintenance instructions 	(d)  Physical dimensions of collapsed drogue including diameter and  length 	(e)	Address: 	ASC/668 AESS 	1895 5th Street, Building 46 	WPAFB, OH 45433-7200 	Attn: Mr. John Shock Submit to the government (see below address) 7 days prior to the scheduled  ground/flight evaluation the following: 	(a)	Drogues (include spare drogue(s) if desired) 	(b)	Visit request if representative is attending in person 	(c)	Address:	413th  Flight Test Squadron 	320 Tully Street 	Bldg 90343 	Hurlburt Field, FL 	Attn: Mr. Jim O?Brien At government request be prepared to participate in the government Safety  Review Board. 3.0  Government Support of Flight Evaluation The government will provide: 	(a)	C-130 equipped with Sargent Fletcher 48000- 02/04 pods 	(b)	Test pilot and crew 	(c)	MA-2/3 refueling coupling interface 	(d)	Chase aircraft and crew 	(e)	Video and photography equipment 	(f)	Safety Review Board 	(g)	A brief test report and video of results This is a change to the reference pre-solicitation notice.

<DESC>The Coast Guard intends to procure on a sole source basis, NLETS User Fees and Line Charges for a base period from 1 February 2008 through 31 January 2009, and four (4) 12-month option periods to follow.  The National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) is a sophisticated computer-controlled message switching network, linking local, state, and federal agencies together for the purpose of information exchange. It is the only national system which provides state and local law enforcement with the capability to exchange free-form criminal justice related information interstate. The system is operated and controlled by the states. Every state is a member. NLETS provides the U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement units with centralized access to Federal, State, and Local law enforcement databases. The service is part of an existing U.S. Coast Guard MISLE system. NLETS is currently the only approved network of its kind to provide information from the states. The alternative would be to set-up communications and database protocols with every federal, state, and local law enforcement agency. Other firms who can furnish these user fees and line charges are invited to submit clear and convincing data substantiating their capability to furnish the entire requirement. Vendors failing to provide complete information for an accurate comparison will not be considered.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service is seeking engineering firms qualified to provide boundary and topographic surveys of proposed wetland easement areas.  

Boundary survey work shall include research, field surveys, field notes, computations, boundary monumentation, a survey map, report, boundary description, CD +/- R in ESRI format shape file, and surveyor?s certificate addressing title subjections. Requirements for survey mapping: all surveys are to be completed on hardcopy map will be close traverses meeting a minimum accuracy of 1/10,000 after angular adjustments.  Methods used to obtain this requirement are at the discretion of the surveyor.  Each parcel map shall include the Point of Beginning with an associated coordinate, the grid angle between True North and Grid North and scale factor for converting grid distance to ground distances.  Requirements for resource GPS: all surveys shall be referenced to UTM Zone 18 or 17, North American Datum (NAD) 83 decimal degrees, meters. Required accuracy of three meters or less on all positions.  

Topographic surveys shall include sufficient detail to produce a topographic map of the designated area with a one foot contour.  Obvious grade breaks will be noted.  All low points along the boundary of the site will be determined such that maximum water levels in impoundments can be designed without flooding off site land. Any channels deeper than 1.5 feet will be shown. The main drainage way will be identified as such.  The water surface elevation and date shall be noted on significant bodies of standing water.  Any significant ground features (culverts, tile outlets, obstructions, etc.) that can not be identified on an aerial photograph will be identified and located.  Topographic survey will be geo-rectified to the UTM NAD 83 horizontal projection such that ortho-images can be easily overlain.  Pipe invert elevations on visible inlets and outlets will be noted.  Use UTM NAVD 88 for vertical datum.  Topographic surveys will be provided in the form of a map, and electronically on a CD in a format that can be opened in AutoCAD 2006.  Surface data used to generate contours will be provided in a form usable in Autodesk Land Desktop (e.g., dtm file, 3D faces, breaklines, boundary polylines).  If special linetypes are used, the linetype file will be provided. Survey point data will be provided in a comma delimited ASCII file.  Control points with descriptions and witness data will be included.  A list of feature codes describing points will be provided.  All topographic survey data will be provided in US Survey Feet.

The continued operation of the Agency?s Satellite Interconnect System (SIS) on Intelsat Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR) 332.5 Degree East Satellite and the Intelsat Pacific Region (POR) 180 Degree East Satellite.

Interested firms must submit adequate documentation of their capability to respond to this requirement in writing within fifteen ( 15) calendar days after the posting date of this notice.  All documentation submitted shall be sufficient in depth and detail to allow for an evaluation without the need for added information.  The Government will not accept oral or incomplete submission.  A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement will be based upon the response to this Public Notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This small business set-aside procurement is being made in accordance with the procedures in FAR Parts 12 and 15. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will award a single Firm Fixed-Price Contract with a period of performance of six months. The solicitation number is HSCG23-08-R-HPH006 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) under NAICS Code 541611: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The solicitation document, and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-20.

1.1 SCOPE:
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) currently has a need for Contractor support in developing a Strategic Master Plan for a new National Coast Guard Museum. The plan will include but not limited to the following: Vision and Mission, Site Analysis, Market Analysis, Operations, Organization and Staffing and a Milestone Plan. The Final Strategic Master Plan shall be developed within six months from the date of contract award. This will be a Performance-Based Acquisition. 

1.2 BACKGROUND:
The USCG, one of the United States (U.S.) five armed services, is one of the only armed services without a National Museum.  The proposed new National Museum would provide a facility to educate visitors about the USCG?s rich maritime heritage and its 216-year history of providing Homeland Security and maritime rescues around the world. 

The current USCG Museum is located in one wing of Waesche Hall, at the USCG Academy Library in New London, Connecticut.  It has been at this location for the past 25 years. This museum has approximately 5,000 square feet of space for storage, exhibits, and administrative duties.  As a result of the limited space, it cannot display large artifacts or traveling exhibits.  In addition, most of the USCG?s artifacts are either in storage or on loan to other institutions (e.g., the Coast Guard Exhibit Center in Forestville, Maryland). The USCG Academy currently provides funding for all utilities, maintenance, and security.  Currently, the museum has one full-time employee, and approximately 20 part-time volunteers. The United States Coast Guard Museum Feasibility, Programming, and Siting Study concluded that the current museum is far below the space required for such a facility, even with its present visitation.  This museum serves approximately 20,000 visitors annually.

As noted by a Coast Guard Historian, ?the Coast Guard has served our Nation for over 210 years?yet the public, as well as the men and women in today?s Service, has little idea how these watchwords [Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty] are spliced with the Service?s past? (Browning 2001).  To a great extent, this situation arises from the inadequacy of the current USCG Museum.  

The primary goal of the proposed new National Museum is to educate visitors about the USCG?s rich maritime heritage and unique contribution to Homeland Security, and to properly store, preserve, and display USCG artifacts. Additionally, the proposed new National Museum should pose minimal financial and operational risk to the USCG and the U.S. Furthermore, development of the surrounding property should be supportive of and consistent with a museum and museum goals. 

The new National Coast Guard Museum is slated to be built in New London, Connecticut and it is anticipated that it will be anywhere between 40,000 to 60,000 sq. ft.

1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL:
1.3.1 Team Lead. The Contractor shall provide a Team Lead who shall be responsible for all Contractor work performed under this contract. The Government further designates the Team Lead as KEY (See Section 1.4).

1.3.4 Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons:  The Government may at its sole discretion direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from the USCG?s and DHS? facilities for misconduct or security reasons.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-9131), 1900 Half Street S.W. JR11-0203, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 30 January 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 28 January 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

(2)  QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
	(a)  Introduction 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) was developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Performance-Based Work Statement. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective. 
This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.

	
(b)  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

REQUIRED SERVICE	PERFORMANCE STANDARD	METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE	INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE
Timeliness	All products, services and items shall be delivered within established timeframes	Visual	Incentive: Outstanding performance rating
Disincentive: OPM elects not to consider contractor for future requirements
Consistency to Requirements	All products, services and items shall satisfy the requirements of the contract/order	Visual	Incentive: Outstanding performance rating
Disincentive: OPM elects not to consider contractor for future requirements

Surveillance and Monitoring; An agency representative will monitor performance by a system of inspection and random sampling, any complaints received from OPM personnel will be passed on to the Contractor for correction.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order to CACI INC FEDERAL for the technical support for the closeout, retirement, and/or destruction of approximately 3,000 inactive contracts and  purchase/delivery order files in the SDDC-AQ offices in Alexandria, Virginia, prior to the BRAC closure of the office.  The Surface Deployment and Distribution Command intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance  with statutory authority Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplier will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  In accordance with  Justification and Approval number 08-001, a determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because CACI INC FEDERAL is the current contractor providing the acquisition support services to SDDC-AQ, and a call to the current BPA, to include  follow-on support until the BRAC closure, was unable to be processed by the Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE). Due to this, a stand-alone contract for the continuing acquisition support is being developed to complete the final phase of the BRAC closu re.  This stand-alone contract is necessary to meet mission requirements. Period of Performance is 26 January 2008 to 30 September 2008. The close out of this Sole Source notification will be January 18, 2008 at 1400Hrs EST.  Questions should be directed t o Sue Kinsey via email no later than January 18, 2008 1300 Hrs EST.

Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Contractor?s best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.?

QUESTION 15: Can you supply any information re the budget of this project? Either for just the Master Plan or for the whole project?

QUESTION 16: You mention that the proposal needs to be submitted in 2 separate
binders: one will have the relevant price performance info as well as the technical info, and one will have the price info. What is the difference between the relevant price performance and the price information?

ANSWER 18: Original Business Case plan was for 200,000 based on 2002 Study which would be made available upon award.  However, the Coast Guard would like the firm selected to complete an independent analysis of likely attendance as part of the Strategic Master Plan.

QUESTION 21: Do you plan to consolidate collections storage at this location?

ANSWER 21: Some, but not the majority of our collection currently in storage. 

QUESTION 22: Section 4.15-Milestone Plan: assume this is a milestone for subsequent design and construction of the museum.  Is there an anticipated date (range) for completion of the overall project?

ANSWER 24: Two of the sites are near Fort Trumbull State Park in New London, CT and NHPA considerations will need to be considered in the design if built there.  A third possible location being considered in New London may have some archaeological significance, but the State of Connecticut has not completed their survey of this parcel yet, thus the caution.

<CONTACT>Roger Fordahl, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-767-7620, Fax 202-767-5896, Email roger.fordahl@nrl.navy.mil - F. Janilea Bays, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-767-2974, Fax 202-767-0430, Email jan.bays@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from potential offerors.  The questions and answers are as follows:

1.	We would anticipate that the lead time for an ultra high vacuum chamber would be 18 weeks.  In addition, we would anticipate needing 4 weeks for an engineering design package and 6 weeks for component integration and testing.  This would be a total of 28 weeks, which exceeds the delivery date in the solicitation of 120 days.  Is NRL willing to extend the delivery date in the solicitation?

No.  A delivery schedule of 120 days is required.

2.  The specification refers to several chambers: 
the multi-wafer loadlock chamber (Specifications, paragraph 12.0), the Sputtering chamber (Specifications, paragraph  1.2), the E beam chamber (Specifications, paragraph 1.1) and the Appendage chamber (Specifications, paragraph 16.0).  The following questions are asked regarding these chambers:

a.	I assume that the wafer/masks must transfer to all chambers.  Please clarify.
        
The wafer/masks must be transferable between the load-lock chamber, the sputtering chamber and the appendage chamber.

b.	NRL?s Specification 3.0 requires a UHV design for magnetrons.  Our magnetic heads are fully UHV compatible. However, NRL?s Specification also requires a base pressure of 5 x10-8 torr and an elastomer seal on the chamber.  Can we use an elastomer seal for the feed through on the magnetrons?

NRL?s Specification states that the magnetrons must be a UHV design with no elastomers.  The only place that can have an elastomer seal for the sputtering system is between the top lid of the sputtering chamber and the chamber body.  

c.	NRL?s Specification requires that the substrate heater allow heating up to 850 C in a pure oxygen environment.  Is this in all chambers?  Please specify which chambers require heating to this level.

The 850C requirement is for the substrate holder located in the sputtering chamber.

d.	NRL?s Specification 1.1 requires that the evaporation chamber be mounted to two steel frames.  I assume one frame is to support the chamber and the other frame is to support the electronics.  Please clarify.
  
      The sputtering chamber, evaporation chamber, and the electronics should be mounted to one L shape steel frame.

e.  	Does NRL require a pump for the sputter chamber?

NRL?s requirements for a pump are detailed in paragraph 2.0 of the Specifications.

f.   NRL?s  Specification 1.2 requires that the main substrate chamber be mounted ?on top? of the main evaporation chamber to allow for the proper distance that is necessary for evaporation to take place.  Is NRL requesting that the transfer heights be compatible with evaporation?

No.  The transfer height must be compatible between the load-lock chamber, the sputtering chamber and the appendage chamber.  The evaporation chamber is mounted below the sputtering chamber.

3.   The following questions refer to NRL?s Specification 8.0 for the substrate holder:

 a. Is this for both the sputtering chamber and the evaporation chamber?
            
          The sputtering chamber and the evaporation chamber must share one substrate holder which is located in the sputtering chamber.

b.	Please define the ?wagon wheel? style transferable substrate carrier.

The ?wagon wheel? style is one design to allow in-situ mask exchange and to allow the target surface and the substrate to be parallel.  Other designs will also be considered.  Therefore, the requirement for a ?wagon wheel? style is deleted from the Specification.

4.  NRL?s Specification 9.0 requires an Inconel ?propeller? to replace the ?wagon wheel? susceptor for high temperature applications.  Please define ?propeller?.

It is a substrate holder kit to allow the substrate to go to 850C.

5.  Does NRL require that the evaporation and sputter system have an isolation valve?
        
Yes.

6.  NRL?s Specification 12.0 requires that aluminum be used for the loadlock chamber body.  Does the loadlock need to be made from aluminum or can stainless steel be used?

Yes, stainless steel can be used.  The requirement for aluminum is deleted from the Specification.

7.   Does NRL require a gate valve between the turbo pump and the loadlock?
  
 No.

52.212-2 - Addendum to Evaluation     Commercial Items     (JAN 1999) 

Basis for Award 

Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost.       Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.     Technical Factors are significantly more important than cost or price.     It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary. FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government.     FDAs acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.     Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance and each offerors technical solution are evaluated.     These tradeoffs process depends on the governments assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price. The offerors past performance will be evaluated after initial technical review.     If a competitive range is established only those offerors included in the competitive range will be evaluated.     
Technical Evaluation - The technical evaluation shall be based upon the completeness and thoroughness of the technical proposal.     The offeror shall demonstrate that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.     The following criteria will be scored as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all technical proposals submitted.     The Contracting Officer shall make his/her award decision based on the best value to the Government as defined in FAR 2.101.     Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:

Personnel Qualifications:     40 points
The offeror shall demonstrate that personnel selected to accomplish this contract are available and have the necessary education, expertise and experience to accomplish these tasks.     The project manager must have experience in managing a staff.     Staff must have recent experience in related work and a similar work setting. Experience and mix of staff that justifies the number, proposed labor hours and types of employees needed to carry out the work described in the Scope of Work.     The Government shall look for appropriate levels of expertise, experience and training of key personnel. This evaluation shall measure the corporations ability to support the long term needs of the contract. The Government shall measure the availability of existing corporate resources and technical expertise in overseeing/managing resources leading to, efficient and safe execution of the statement of work.

Technical Approach:     35 points
Proposed Quality Control (QC) Plan shall be evaluated for its overall soundness, review procedures, QC checks assuring soft-copy records retention, and approach to ensure effective review and documentation procedures; within the established timeframes. 
The offerors proposal must 1) describe the approach to comply with each of the SOW requirements; 2) demonstrate consistency with the stated goals and objectives; and, 3) document a sound approach to assure the achievement of timely and acceptable performance.
The managerial ability to achieve performance requirements as demonstrated by the proposed use of management and other personnel resources shall be evaluated.

Technical Understanding:     25 points
The offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the objectives, techniques, and purpose of this contract.
The managerial ability to achieve delivery or performance requirements as demonstrated by the proposed use of management and other personnel resources shall be evaluated.Soundness and feasibility of the approach for performing the Services in the SOW shall require the offeror to reflect a thorough understanding of sound business practices and knowledge of Government Laws, policies and practices as they relate to the Paperwork Reduction Act and related initiatives.       The offeror shall also demonstrate a sound technical approach related to delivery of each task outlined in the statement of work and ongoing plans designed to maintain a seamless execution of each task.

Costs will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism which is defined as the offeror's ability to project costs which are reasonable and indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed.     

Negotiations will be conducted with those offerors determined to have submitted technically acceptable proposals together with a realistic cost estimate.     The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents best value in that it offers the best combination of technical capabilities, past performance, and proposed cost.

POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS
The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications     Commercial Items
Offeror must include a completed copy of 52-212-3 with its offer.
