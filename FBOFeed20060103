<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with several state health departments, conducts population-based, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus (GAS), and group B streptococcus (GBS) through the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program of CDC’s Emerging Infections Program Network. ABCs is used to follow trends in disease rates, to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions (e.g., vaccination), and to conduct special epidemiologic and laboratory studies. As a result, timely susceptibility testing and shipping to CDC of these pathogens is an integral function of ABCs.

CDC has a requirement for a contractor to conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing on all isolates confirmed to be S. pneumoniae, GAS, GBS and isolates from persons residing in states that participate in CDC’s ABCs program. The contractor will then ship in a timely fashion all isolates to CDC for additional testing. Because ABCs conducts numerous special studies of antimicrobial resistance and vaccine impact, testing and shipping of isolates and electronic submission of susceptibility data at least monthly is critical. ABCs data are used by investigators external to CDC as well as international partners, including ministries of health, to formulate policies regarding treatment recommendations and vaccine programs. Therefore, strict adherence to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines is expected.

The contractor is required to:  (1) confirm identification of isolates as Streptococcus pneumoniae, GAS, or GBS; (2) store all isolates in a manner that will ensure future viability. The isolates will be received from the CDC Streptococcal laboratory or directly from surveillance sites collaborating with CDC. Isolates received from surveillance sites then need to be shipped to CDC for additional characterization, e.g., serotyping;  (3) ship additional subcultures of each isolate to the CDC and ATSDR Specimen Packaging, Inventory and Repository (CASPIR) for permanent storage; (4) Perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae, GAS, and GBS.

This is a full and open competition.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 621511. A firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR part 15 is contemplated.  There will be a base period of performance of twelve (12) months and four 12-month option periods.  

 CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP number 2005-N-02013 will be available on or about June 30, 2005.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after posting of the RFP.  All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via email trouthmurphy@cdc.gov.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at fedbizopps website for downloading when issued.  No telephone request of the solicitation will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror. Solicitation HM1576-06-R-0005 is scheduled for release on or about 18 January 2006, with a closing date of 10 February 2006. No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored. The solicitation (and any amendments) will be available for downloading on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS), website at https://www.fedteds.gov for all interested parties. It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTeDS (https://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to negotiate separate single source contracts with three vendors: Garrett Metal Detectors, Garland Texas, CEIA USA, Twinsburg Ohio, and Rapiscan Security Systems, Hawthorne California.  The purpose of this work is to provide engineering services to support the government owned Enhanced Metal Detectors (EMD) for life cycle configuration management and checkpoint lane expansion requirements.TSA is negotiating single-source contracts, because as Original Equipment Manufacturers the three vendors referenced above have the requisite proprietary knowledge and rights to perform reconfiguration on their equipment.  The three contractors are the only manufacturers on the TSA Enhanced Metal Detectors (EMD) Qualified Vendors List.
TSA anticipates a 12 month period of performance; this will allow for the completion of the qualification process for EMD2 contract award.

<DESC>CONTACT Barbara Johns, Logistics Management Specialist, 732-532-3032. Title: Total support approach for an umbrella contract that would provide overall support for the GUARDRAIL weapon system. CECOM/ GUADRAIL weapon system teams is seeking interest f or a plan to provide a top down support plan to manage the logistics support for Sustainment support of GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System. The ultimate goal of this market research would be a explore the possibility of a contract that will provide logistics s upport, repair support, acquisition of spare parts, Field Service Representative support and technical support for obsolete hardware. GUARDRAIL is a COMMINT/ELINT collection system that has 4 field locations. The current system has numerous vanishing vendo r issues and a high sustainment cost. Anyone interested in providing a response should outline their experience with the current technology and have some suggested plan for the required support. The intent is to keep these systems supportable through 2017.  Note that responses that are general in nature and show only your knowledge of general electronic research will not be considered a valid response. Responses must address an approach to providing a total system approach including a sub-contracting plan fo r Commercial off the shelf items and all items that currently supported by contractor repair, a partnership with Tobyhanna Army depot and a method of providing a system a total logistics system that would provide a timely turn around time for repair suppor t. Submission must also include a plan a plan for modernization and show the contractors ability and commitment to solving issues of vanishing vendors through the systems remaining life cycle.  The plan should include a logistics structure that show the number of employees that would be required to administer the support process. For example, a list of the suggested labor categories and number of people you feel will be required to administer the support. The plan should also include how the respondent pl ans to manage the stock store and issue of critical components and how the contractor will handle a system for returning items to various sources for repair and ensuring the delivery of needed components to the field customer when repairs are completed.  T his plan should include how the contractor proposes to track all transactions including shipping, cost  Respondents must be able to show a history of work with the GUARDRAIL weapon system.  Responses that do not show a historic knowledge of this weapon sys tem will not be considered a valid response. Since the respondents should have a working knowledge of the total system, no technical information will be provided for review by respondents to this market research. Since information on the total system would  contain some information not for general release we are expecting that respondents have enough knowledge of the total system to respond without the information being provided. Note that the USG is not ensuring any commitment that this plan will be execute d. This is an attempt to research the pros and cons of this approach and to evaluate industry interest in the approach.  No information will be provided by the USG about current cost and support approaches to any prospective respondent. It should be unders tood that this may not result in any solicitation. If a solicitation does result it will most likely be on a competitive basis and at that time, respondents will be required to due a more detailed proposal of cost and function. All information received wil l be held under proprietary guidelines and will not be shared with anyone outside the USG GUARDRAIL team.  Respondents may also be requested at some time in the future to participate in a industry day to present their plan to the USG team for review. All i nterested parties considering submission in support of this request support should submit a white paper no greater than 50 pages in length which should at a min imum the following information: 1) Provide evidence of the contractors facilities and experience with GUARDRAIL equipment and technology. Again note that responses that address only a general knowledge of work with electronic equipment will not be conside red. Responses must show work with the GUARDRAIL weapon system. 2) Provide evidence of past performance on the GUARDRAIL system.  Include a list of previous contracts or any current contracts that show GUARDRAIL support. 3) A list of labor categories (note : cost is not be requested at this time only labor categories) that shows the number of people you suggest are required for the total system support approach. 4) A plan for how the respondent will partner with the USG (including Tobyhanna Army depot) and a  subcontracting plan that shows how Commercial off the self items would be supported as well as items that are already contractor repaired by other vendors. The contractor should be able to exhibit a partnership plan that shows a total support approach. It  is suggested that this information include an estimated pass through percentage and G&A. Note: This will not be considered a bid, it is merely a estimate of overhead cost for evaluation purposes. 5) A plan for how all logistics actions will be tracked an integrated with Army standards systems.   6) An obsolescence plan that shows how the contractor plans to keep the GUARDRAIL system sustainable and current until 2017 or until the end of the systems life cycle. It would be advisable to show any past work you have done for the GUARDRAIL system that  show your ability to replace or modernize GUARDRAIL equipment. This documentation may be mailed to US Army, Commander CECOM, AMSEL-LC-IEWS-R-GR, Building 1201W, Fort, Monmouth, NJ 07703-5211 to the attention of Barbara Johns.  Documentation may also be sent to electronic address barbara.johns@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue a competitive solicitation to produce the Signal Data Processor assembly of the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system.  CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare (AAW) capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units.  CEC fuses the distributed data into a fire control quality, single, air track picture that significantly improves own unit track precision, consistency and continuity; expands detection ranges; and increases reaction time.  CEC also improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies.  The processor set for CEC has recently been re-designed to achieve pre-planned product improvement goals in reducing the weight, size, cost, power, and cooling o!  bjectives, while maintaining CEC Baseline 2.1 functionality.  The initial award would be for up to 6 signal data processor assemblies in FY 2006 with priced options through FY 2010 for an additional 82 units.  Installation and Checkout (INCO) Kits and initial spares will also be solicited and will be full signal data processor units as the full unit is the lowest repairable unit (LRU) (i.e., box level sparing).  The initial INCO/spares award would be for up to 5 signal data processor assemblies in FY 2006 with priced options through FY 2010 for an additional 13 units.  First delivery is scheduled to begin 12 months after contract.  A firm fixed price contract will be solicited.  This assembly provides the core of the CEC system and provides the processing capability for sensor track fusion.  A competitive solicitation is expected to be issued within the next 60 days.  The requirement will be based on a design specification that was manufactured and tested in FY 2005.  The s!  ource selection will be based on a best value determination.  If your  firm is interested in this procurement, please send an expression of interest by 31 January 2006 to the Contracting Officer at Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Mr. John M. Murray (SEA 02513), 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040 or at e-mail address: John.M.Murray1@navy.mil.  This expression of interest should contain a single point-of-contact and include mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address for said point-of-contact.  Only one point-of-contact per company is requested.  Offers from foreign companies will not be considered.

<DESC>Note: This Synopsis was previously posted under Classification Code: R – Professional, administrative, and management support services; NAICS Code: 541611 – Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. Previous Synopsis  was deleted.

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide training and human capital services and solutions to a large number of Federal Government agencies through OPM’s Training and Management Assistance (TMA) Branch. For more than 20 years, OPM has used TMA as a resource to help Federal agencies accomplish a variety of training and human capital management projects, specifically in support of human capital development and organizational performance improvement.

The proposed acquisition will be solicited using Full and Open Competition procedures. We will consider all responsible sources that submit a responsive technical and price proposal by the closing time and date of the RFP. OPM anticipates awarding multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts that allow for firm fixed price delivery orders.

The resulting performance-based contracts will enable OPM to successfully support its client agencies in improving the proficiency of their workforces, the structures and business processes of their organizations, and the effectiveness with which they fulfill their missions and objectives. Every effort will be made by the TMA program office to work with customer agencies to develop performance-based statements of work, as appropriate, for each task to be negotiated and awarded under each of the TMA contracts. The projects will be awarded primarily through task order competitions among the qualified firms by virtue of their selection for an IDIQ award. 

The TMA program provides support in two (2) service areas:

1.	Custom Training and Learning Solutions.
Provide government agencies support in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and/or evaluation of instructional products regardless of subject area. Some examples of products and services under this key service area include: instructor-led materials; print-based instructional materials; technology-based training products; job aids; performance support strategies and tools; knowledge management systems; learning organization strategies; consulting; learning systems development and integration; and training management systems. Some technology-based training will be developed using Government-adopted software and systems.

2.	Custom Strategic Human Capital Solutions.
Provide government agencies support in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and/or evaluation of strategies and systems that align human resources management with an agency’s mission and that manage, appraise, compensate, and retain a high-quality and diverse workforce. Some examples of services under this key service area include: strategic human resources planning; human resources system development and integration; consulting; business process reengineering; compensation; performance management; performance measurement and improvement; program management support; and program evaluation.

The RFP will allow offerors to submit proposals for either one or both of these service areas.
 
Place of Performance: Most projects will require contractor performance in the Washington, D.C. metro area. However, TMA does service client agencies wherever they may be located, to include sites outside the continental U.S. 

Duration of the contract period: The period of performance includes a 12 month base period plus four 12-month option periods.

Offeror Question Submissions: OPM will accept and answer questions from offerors after the RFP has been released. All questions will be answered in an amendment to the RFP to allow all interested offerors access to the same information.  The RFP will provide an outline of the procedures for submitting questions.

Pre-Proposal Conference: OPM intends to host a pre-proposal conference not later than two (2) weeks after release of the RFP. The date and time of the conference will be announced when the RFP is released. The location is anticipated to be in the D.C. Metro area.  The pre-proposal conference will provide potential offerors with an overview of the TMA program. You are strongly encouraged to attend this conference. Attending the conference will familiarize you with our operations, infrastructure and business processes, and should help you prepare a more responsive proposal. At least two days prior to the conference, you must email to the OPM point of contact a notice of your intent to attend. Each bidder will be limited to two attendees. Due to security concerns, offerors failing to register will not be allowed to attend. When registering for the conference, all offerors must provide the following information:

1.	Your company name.
2.	Single company point of contact (first name, last name, title, telephone, fax, email, and mailing address.
3.	Your company website address.
4.	List of attendees (total number of your staff expected to attend the conference, first and last names, titles, social security numbers, U.S. citizenship status (yes or no), telephone, fax, email, and mailing addresses.
5.	Your NAICS code.
6.	Your company business size/type (based on NAICS code above).  This will allow companies to make teaming arrangements if desired.  
7.	One-page executive summary of your company (including a general overview of the services and products you offer) in MS Word format.

After we receive your registration information, we will email your company point of contact a pre-proposal conference registration packet. The packet will include information related to directions to our facility, hotel/lodging, transportation, special accommodations, and a sample agenda.

Procurement Timeline: We anticipate issuing the solicitation on or about January 15, 2006. Proposals will be due on or about March 1, 2006. Our award decision will be based on a best value determination.

Evaluation Process: OPM intends to award contracts to responsible offerors whose proposals provide best value to the Government. Proposals must meet the terms and conditions of this solicitation prior to being evaluated in terms of the technical factors and subfactors.

<DESC>COMBAT RESCUE TANKER (ADVANCED CONCEPTS) MARKET RESEARCH Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and the Combat Rescue Tanker  (CRT) Integrated Product Team (IPT) are conducting advanced market  research looking for new concepts to perform the combat search and rescue  mission.  These concepts may be manned or unmanned; however they must fill  the roles performed by the existing fleet. Current platform provides Personnel Recovery/Recovery Operations (PR/RO)  forces with the capability to conduct in-flight and ground refueling of  vertical lift assets.  It also has the capability to provide overt/covert  airland or airdrop delivery of Pararescuemen and their equipment.  In  addition, the platform can perform the Airborne Mission Commander (AMC)  mission. The concept must be capable of operating in 10 percent worldwide climatic  extremes as defined in MIL-HDBK-310., in all environmental regions of the  globe (e.g., arctic, desert, mountainous, littoral, tropical, etc.), day  or night, during adverse weather conditions, and in a variety of spectrums  of warfare to include passing through Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical  (NBC) environments.  The support and deployment concepts include the  capability to operate from main operating bases, forward operating bases,  and forward operating locations.

<DESC>USAID/Colombia, Office of Democracy and Governance, anticipates award of a three year contract with options for two-one year extensions for the Judicial Reform and Modernization Program. The  JRMP will support Colombian judiciary initiatives to be more independent, effective and transparent. This new effort will include results areas to broaden, deepen and build on justice sector reform achievements to date, while responding to new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the GOC justice system. The program will also broaden access to justice through an array of initiatives offering free and timely access to legal services for millions of economically or socially disenfranchised, violence impacted and/or geographically marginalized Colombians.

Four lower level USAID Intermediate Results (IR) areas are anticipated within the JRMP. They are:      

o	IR 1.1.1:  Effective National Implementation of the new Criminal Procedures (Accusatory System) Reform (CPAR); 

o	IR 1.1.2:  Strengthened Court Administration and Management (CAM); 

o	IR 1.1.3:  Increased Access to Justice (ATJ ); and

o	    IR 1.1.4:  - Enhanced Civil Society Roles in Justice Reform and Modernization (CS-JRM).    

For all of the above, assistance will be emphasized in extending justice services to rural, conflict affected, and marginalized populations.

In addition to the above, the USAID program should also be programmatically positioned and structured for possible implementation of an additional future Program Modifier (contingency) intermediate result; implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. This program modifier would be implemented only if future programmatic authorization and additional funding is provided for implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.  

The estimated ceiling amount of the contract is not to exceed $20.5 million. The Contingency Modifier shall not exceed $2 million. 

The RFP will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fbo.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no RFPs will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   This is a sources sought notice for written information only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) is conducting market research to determine potential sources for services enabling RPD to construct a materials flow account of critical  radioisotopes, using FAR Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisition Procedures. RPD is dedicated to minimizing incidences of lost radioactive sources that enter into consumer metal supplies and the public domain. Industrial devices and consumer products containing radioactive sources routinely fall out of  regulatory control. Once this occurs, these devices and products may be subjected to harsh conditions capable of producing a breached source, with the potential of harmful exposure incidents and significant economical impacts to industry. Under the proposed Purchase Order, the Contractor will focus  on successfully enabling RPD to construct a materials flow account of critical radioisotopes on an annual basis that can be published in a report and shared with other key agencies and industry in an effort to better understand the collective flow of these materials, throughout the U.S. economy.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, with a size standard of $6.0 million. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a request for interested potential offerors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how  they plan to meet the above requirement. Submissions shall be limited to no more than two pages. Standard brochures will not be considered as a sufficient response to this notice. The capability statements should include the following: (1) Name of vendor; (2) Contact information (address,  telephone, facsimile, e-mail); (3) Technical description of capabilities in meeting the requirement; (4) Experience with industrial devices and consumer products containing radioactive sources; and (5) Business size and classification (small, large, small-disadvantaged, certified 8(a), HUBZone,  woman-owned, service-disabled veteran, Native American, etc.) Businesses should submit an electronic copy of the requested information to Contract Specialist Nicole Humphrey at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov no later than January 18, 2006, 4:00 p.m. EST. Based upon information currently available, the  Government does not anticipate fulfilling this requirement through a small business set-aside. The method of competition will be determined after all responses to this notice have been evaluated. The Request for Quotes (RFQ) including the Statement of Work, evaluation factors, and quote submission  instructions will be available on or about January 27, 2006 at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0600084/index.html with a 30-day response time.

<DESC>Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is a non-immunologic reaction elicited by the direct action of a chemical substance on the skin.  Both extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence the development of this adverse condition.  ICD is the most common work-related skin disease and the second most common cause of occupational-related health problems.  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, National Institute for Occupations Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with West Virginia Univeristy Research Corporation, Morgantown, WV to perform Phase 2 for professional services to determine underlying mechanism differences in susceptibility to skin irritants in Health Care Workers.  
This project is currently supported by a justification for other than full and open competition to West Virginia University under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3) and the Phase I pilot study was announced in FedBizOpps in August 2005.  This Phase 2 is for the data collection using patch tests on human subjects.  WVU has highly qualified dermatologists and immunologists to conduct the approved protocol.  Their close proximity of WVU to NIOSH will also allow our investigators to be directly involved in the related measurements and experimental trials.  This work is an extension of our previous collaboration with the Pediatrics Department at WVU and will allow us to compare our data with the pediatric data collected previously with the techniques that are described in this protocol.  WVU has already obtained Institutional Review Board approval for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (IRB) to perform this effort.   
This announcement is being issued for information purposes only; a request for quotations is not available.  Consideration of an alternate source would require a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that:  1)  the organization possesses the expertise of highly qualified dermatologists and immunologist to conduct the protocol;  2)  the organization has access to adequate volunteer populations of health care workers (nurses, physicians, and technicians), with no existing skin dieases, who wash their hands at least 8 times a day;  3) the organization can  identify a previous collaboration where data was collected using the techniques described in this protocol which could be used for comparison;  and  4) the ability to obtain Institutional Review Board approval for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (IRB) to perform this effort in a timeframe that would not delay the work.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate an award of a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the University of California at Santa Barbara, Department of Psychology, Santa Barbara, California 93106-9660, to continue an ongoing collaborator of exploring individual learning gene-environment interactions, a key concept in developing interventions to prevent common diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.   The Statement of Work is as follows: Background: Individualized preventive medicine based on genetic risk has been described as an important possible benefit of Human Genome Project.  According to this vision, individuals could choose to learn information about their susceptibilities to common diseases and then take steps to reduce their risks where possible.  In order for individuals to benefit in this way from information about genetic susceptibility, however, medical and public health professionals need to be able to communicate the information in an understandable and usable way.  The challenges involved in such communication are substantial; complex concepts must be conveyed and the information is inherently probabilistic.   Individuals? levels of genetic-related knowledge and skills, or their ?genetic literacy,? also need to be considered.   Existing research has demonstrated that nearly one-half of the population has limitations in their general literacy skills (e.g., reading, writing, number skills).  As discussed below, very little data exist, however, on the genetic-related skills and knowledge of the general public.  Adults? levels of conceptual knowledge, or knowledge of the background concepts required to understand and use genomic information, are likely to be problematic.  Applying genomic information to improving health will require an understanding of the complex and multi-factorial nature of common disease and will rely on knowledge of several key concepts, including the idea of gene-environment interactions.  Developing strategies to increase conceptual knowledge in adults with varying levels of literacy skills will be a critical step in using information about genomic risk to influence individuals? behaviors and health outcomes.   However, existing research provides little guidance for the development of appropriate communication strategies for genomic concepts.  The lack of effective, research-based strategies to meet the information needs of individuals with limited or average levels of literacy are a significant gap in the public health literature.  This research study will focus on the health communication challenge of developing and evaluating effective communication strategies to present the key genomic concept of gene-environment interactions to adults with varying literacy levels.  The findings from this study will be useful in developing ways to communicate genomic information to the general public and will address substantial gaps in the genetic and public health literature.   Objectives: The objectives of this study are 1) to compare the effects of learning mode (learning-by-assimilation versus learning-by-doing) on participant comprehension of the concept that genetic and environmental factors interact to affect risk of common diseases; and 2) to explore possible mediation of variables such as sel-efficacy, motivation, attention, involvement, interest, enjoyment, and elaboration in the hypothesized relationship between learning mode and comprehension.  Description of Work: The requirement falls into three categories: (1) consulting on the conceptual design of a virtual reality learning experience study; (2) programming of the virtual reality learning experiences; and (3) beta-version testing of the virtual reality learning experiences with healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the reality of the experience and other logistical factors (such as visual clarity, pilot subjects? ability to navigate through the system) that might impede the virtual experience.   To comprehend and makes use of genetic information, individuals need a set of skills, vocabulary, and areas of conceptual knowledge, which can be referred to as their ?genetic literacy.?  The development and evaluation of techniques that can increase genetic literacy is an important area of health communication research.  An innovative technology known as Immersive Virtual Environment Technology (IVET) has a promise as a laboratory setting that could be used to test strategies to increase genetic literacy, but no existing research studies have addressed this issued to date.  We are collaborating with the IVET team at the University of California-Santa Barbara, which will allow us to begin to investigate this timely research topic.  To initiate this collaboration, we are developing a project that will be the first protocol for NHGRI?s new IVET laboratory.  The overarching objective of this project will be to explore individual learning about gene-environment interactions, a key concept in developing interventions to prevent common diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.  To this end, we will be developing virtual learning experiences and testing their effects on individuals? understanding of information about personal risk for common diseases.   Deliverables: The deliverables in regard to the study protocol ?Using Virtual Reality to Test Communication Strategies for Genomic Concepts? are: (1) Technical assistance on the design and development of the educational intervention.  (2) Computer programming for four virtual environments. (3) Pilot testing of the virtual environments to be conducted at the Immersive Virtual Environment Technology (IVET) laboratory at the University of California-Santa Barbara?s Research Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior.   Period of Performance: January 2006 through December 2006.   Place of Performance:  University of California-Santa Barbara?s Research Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior, Santa Barbara, California.    The sole source determination is based upon the ongoing collaboration that began in 2004 - 2005 fiscal years with Dr. James Blascovich, a Professor and Department Chair of Psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).  Dr. Blascovich is a leading authority on using IVET methodologies in experimental social psychology research and leads a premiere IVET research laboratory.  The collaboration brings a unique combination of laboratory setting, research design, and programming skills needed for this project.   An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable simplified acquisition.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541990, Size Standard $6 million dollars.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest  which includes; a firm fixed price, documentation of similar research conducted and the benefits in obtaining the Government?s objectives;  at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government?s minimum specifications; and a proposed delivery plan.   The submission  will be evaluated on the submission of the above documents.   The submission is due on January 13, 2006, 9:00 a.m. The submission must also include any prompt payment discount terms, the Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNs), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Offerors business size.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Human Genome Research (NHGRI)  intends to negotiate an award of a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to BAC / PAC Resources Children?s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, 747 52nd Street, Oakland, California 94609, to purchase genomic DNA Library resources.   The products to be purchased are all BAC / PAC genomic DNA library resources that are offered to academic and scientific research institutions on a cost recovery basis.  At a minimum the Government intents to purchase twenty (20) each, BAC Clone 1st - 20th (LB Stab); twenty (20) each, BAC Clone 21th  - 40th  (LB Stab); and 2,360 each, BAC Clone 41st and above.  Period of Performance:  The proposed period of performance will consist of one twelve (12) month basic contract period.   The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the use of DNA clones from the BAC / PAC Resources Children?s Hospital Oakland Research Institute have been used over the past five (5) years.  We must continue to purchase these  items in order to avoid the introduction of new variables into the experimental results and to avoid long delays resulting from retesting of products from other potential suppliers.   Also, changing variables at this time would result in incorrect interpretation of the test result already in progress.   An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements, is not applicable simplified acquisition.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 339999, Size Standard 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899 has a requirement for face velocity readings to be obtained on all the fume hoods on site. A system check is also required to be performed on the pressurized side. Any deficiencies found shall be reported and if approved by the NIST authorized representative, repaired. Most hoods are served by a dedicated exhaust fan located in the attic level of the laboratory buildings. There is approximately 10 feet of positive pressure ductwork on the outlet side of each fan. Other hoods in the newer buildings are served by a general exhaust system. All interior positive pressure exhaust ducts shall be leak tested. NIST has approximately 545 fume hoods located in various buildings around the site. These hoods are used by scientists and researchers on a daily basis. Most of the hoods are used for a variety of tasks as determined by the needs of the user, the overall majority are for general purpose use; however, there are hoods used for radioactive materials, and acids.     

The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and material necessary to perform the following : (1) The contractor shall perform a visible observation and inspection of mechanical components, fans, ductwork and flex connections for each hood and shall verify the flow sensors are working properly; (2) The contractor shall identify any problems found with the hoods while performing this work, this information shall be submitted to the NIST authorized representative as each building is completed; (3) The contractor shall make repairs upon approval by the Contracting Officer as authorized via a written modification to the purchase order. 

The contractor shall obtain the face velocities on 380 fume hoods located in the laboratories of various buildings (excluding buildings 224, and 222) around the site. Readings must be obtained using a Shortridge Instruments Inc., Air Data Multimeter ADM-860 or newer version and the Velgrid Air Velocity Accessory shall also be used. The test shall be performed as outlined in the Shortridge Operating Instructions, dated 2/21/2003, Chapter 6.0, Section 6.5, titled: Velgrid Air Velocity, as included with the ADM-860. The Contractor is required to complete a grid sheet with average readings and the NIST form ED-2 for each hood tested. NIST shall provide these forms to the Contractor. These completed forms shall be submitted to the NIST authorized representative for record keeping purposes. The 73 fume hoods located in building 224 have already had the face velocity readings checked, however, a leak check of the positive pressurized ducts and inspection of mechanical components etc. shall still be performed. The awarded Contractor obtaining the face velocity readings shall provide at least three (3) hours of hands on training to the NIST HVAC personnel on the proper methods used for obtaining the readings and shall follow all instructions as outlined in the NIST PLANT DIVISION INSTRUCTIONS. (P.D.I.)

Note: The Contractor’s technicians performing the inspections, verifications and measurements must be certified, any other personnel, must be accompanied by a certified technician.  Acceptable certifications are the National Environmental Balancing Board (NEBB) and the American Air Balancing Council (AABC).  All future reference to certified technicians within the posted documentation and Statement of Work in which the Government references certified technicians, shall be either NEBB or AABC certified technicians.


A certified technician shall verify the proper mechanical operation of each fan. Contractor shall check for proper belt tension, check the condition of the scroll and bearings visually and audibly etc., and inspect the condition of the ductwork for leaks or torn flex connections etc.      The Contractor shall notify the NIST authorized representative upon completion of each building inspection and provide a written list of deficiencies. Once the Contractor and the NIST authorized representative have determined the actual repairs required , the Contractor shall provide a written price quote for the repairs to include labor and materials (labor shall be quoted at an hourly rate), to the NIST authorized representative. The NIST authorized representative will determine if the Contractor will be chosen to proceed with the necessary repairs.  If repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repairs, the Contractor’s certified technician shall then verify the proper mechanical operation of each fan. The Contractor’s certified technician shall obtain hood face velocity measurements and determine total CFM on each hood. The sash height should be at fourteen (14) inches whenever possible while this work is being performed. The data collected shall be recorded on NIST forms ED-2 and grid sheets. The Contractor’s certified technician shall verify the accuracy of the flow sensors at each hood.

The following documents will be included in the solicitation package upon posting: (1) Examples of the NIST Grid Sheets and ED-2; (2) Copies of the Shortridge Instruments Inc. operating instruction showing chapter 6.0, Section 6.5; and (3) A copy of the NIST P.D.I. 

Based on the fact that NIST obtains readings with the ADM-860, using the Velgrid Air Velocity Accessory, the Contractor is required to use the specified equipment so that all information can be collected and logged equally.     The ADM- 860 unit used must be NIST traceable. Upon request, The Contractor must provide documentation of NIST traceability to the NIST authorized representative. All lab spaces must be checked for fume hoods as there is a potential that some new hoods may have been installed and others removed and may not be reflected on the current listing. The Contractor shall make record of any new hoods found that were not referenced on the list and any fume hoods that are no longer in place shall also be recorded.    Any new fume hoods that have been found that were not on the list shall be tested and logged.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This notice amends the initial pre-solicitation announcement number N5010060904 issued on December 22, 2005 and amends the announcement that is in the National Business Center electronic system.  This action should have stated that this was a modification/amendment to the initial presolicitation announcement and should have referenced the Solicitation Number N5010060904  in the description. The initial modification/amendment did not reach the FedBizOpps electronic system.  No other changes have been made. The purpose of this announcement is to provide information about this procurement's set-aside status.  This information was inadvertently left out of the initial pre-solicitation announcement.  The "N/A" on page one is not correct.  This project is currently being screened for various socio-economic programs (such as 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses) and should not be considered full-and-open competition to all businesses at this time.  The decision on the set-aside status is anticipated approximately January 9, 2006.  Once the final set-aside determination has been made, another announcement will be issued to communicate the final decision.

<DESC>COMBAT RESCUE TANKER (ADVANCED CONCEPTS) MARKET RESEARCH Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and the Combat Rescue Tanker  (CRT) Integrated Product Team (IPT) are conducting advanced market  research looking for new concepts to perform the combat search and rescue  mission.  These concepts may be manned or unmanned; however they must fill  the roles performed by the existing fleet. Current platform provides Personnel Recovery/Recovery Operations (PR/RO)  forces with the capability to conduct in-flight and ground refueling of  vertical lift assets.  It also has the capability to provide overt/covert  airland or airdrop delivery of Pararescuemen and their equipment.  In  addition, the platform can perform the Airborne Mission Commander (AMC)  mission. The concept must be capable of operating in 10 percent worldwide climatic  extremes as defined in MIL-HDBK-310., in all environmental regions of the  globe (e.g., arctic, desert, mountainous, littoral, tropical, etc.), day  or night, during adverse weather conditions, and in a variety of spectrums  of warfare to include passing through Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical  (NBC) environments.  The support and deployment concepts include the  capability to operate from main operating bases, forward operating bases,  and forward operating locations.  Onboard defensive capabilities must  permit the platform to operate in increased threat environments as  expected through the year 2035.  The concept must be capable of deploying  without immediate strategic airlift support and maintain sustained  operations with a minimum of support. The concept should be capable of refueling rotary wing and tiltrotor  (V-22) aircraft at airspeeds 105-180KEAS, and to incorporate a refueling  drogue that functions throughout that airspeed range without reconfiguring  the system (to included ground and/or airborne reconfiguration of the  drogue).  It must also comply with Software Compliant Architecture and  Joint Tactical Radio Systems mandates, and also comply with net-centric,  airborne networking and IP networking architecture. Request that respondents provide a short (2 to 3 page) statement of  capabilities relative to this requirement, to include aircraft  manufacturing experience, aircraft modification experience, software  development and integration experience, and systems engineering  capability.  This statement should be received by 17 Jan 06.  Questions  and answers concerning Statements of Capabilities should conclude no later  than 16 Feb 06. Responses should be sent to: Major Rique Gwin HQ AFSOC/A5RM 100 Bartley St. Hurlburt Field FL 32544 email: rique.gwin@hurlburt.af.mil A copy of each response should be sent to: Lt. Victor S.

<DESC>Amendment 1 to this solicitation incorporates the Questions and Answers.  The closing date for quotes remains unchanged.  End Amendment 1.

Law School Administrative Expert to Provide Technical Assistance to Law Faculties in the Arabian Gulf Region.

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) of the United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, is a technical assistance provider working on the development and implementation of laws and international agreements affecting trade and investment in over 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and North Africa.  CLDP is supporting the U.S. Government’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) by providing technical assistance to a group of countries in the Middle East to improve their legislative and regulatory frameworks, and ultimately, to facilitate the region’s preparedness for the Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA).  

As trade and commerce increases in the Middle East and the countries in this region expand their presence in the global market, it is important that their business and legal professionals have an ever-greater familiarity with commercial law.  The objective of this particular technical assistance activity is to increase the capacity of law faculties in the region to cultivate future lawyers, judges, policy makers and business people who have an adept understanding of international commercial law practices and standards. As part of an ongoing program to this end, CLDP anticipates awarding a contract to two qualified experts to provide advice regarding the administration of commercial law curricula in law schools in the Middle East.  The experts will advise on the human resource and organizational requirements for the best administration of a commercial law curriculum.

General Description of Work 

Based on in-country consultations with the deans and administrators of the participating institutions, the Contractor will provide specifically tailored advice on all issues of commercial law curriculum administration.  Specifically, but not exclusively, the experts will provide information on appropriate faculty qualifications for the relevant courses, faculty sourcing, capacity building procedures for such faculty, as well as input on crafting course descriptions and syllabus formation.  The Contractor will provide the following services to accomplish this transfer of expertise:

a.	Achieve, in cooperation with CLDP and the appropriate law faculties in the Middle East, an awareness of the latest state of development of the commercial law curricula in the institutions designated by CLDP.

b.	Based on this understanding, and prior to initial consultations in country, draft a preliminary memo on projected areas of need for designated law faculties, challenges to achieving more successful administration, and other points of interest. 

c.	Conduct meetings, in country, with appropriate law school deans and law professors of designated institutions in the Middle East in order to consult on areas of needed input and identify areas of future consultative support.

d.	Submit progress reports for each trip to the region.

e.	Participate in US based consultative visits for law school deans and professors from the designated institutions as they may arise in continuation of the technical assistance program.

The duration of the contract is from date of award through September 30, 2006, with one one-year option period.  The government reserves the right to exercise the option. The contract is expected to commence on or about January 23, 2006.  Award will be a Fixed Price contract and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Quote (RFQ).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, shall be utilized in the selection of the offer that is most advantageous to the to the Government based on the factors contained in the solicitation. The solicitation notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (FedBizOpps) site www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a response which if timely received, must be considered by the Agency. No paper copies of solicitations or amendments will be issued.

This acquisition is being conducted by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe under the provisions of Title I of the Indian Self-Determination Act, P.L. 93-638.

Background The NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has recently restructured its Aeronautics Research into three separate Programs: Fundamental Aeronautics, Aviation Safety, and Airspace Systems. The specific purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit external interest in collaborative public-private research partnerships under NASA’s Fundamental Aeronautics Program: Fundamental Aeronautics Program: The top-level goal of this program is the development of system-level, multi-disciplinary capabilities for both civilian and military applications. This program provides long-term investment in research to support and sustain expert competency in critical core areas of aeronautics technology. While not part of this RFI, separate RFIs will also be issued for NASA’s other two Aeronautics Research Programs: Aviation Safety Program: This program will build upon the unique safety-related research capabilities of NASA to improve aircraft safety for current and future civilian and military aircraft, and to overcome aircraft safety technological barriers that would otherwise constrain the full realization of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. This program will also provide long-term investment in research to support and sustain expert competency in critical core areas of aviation and aircraft safety. Airspace Systems Program: The top-level goal of this program is the development of high capacity, efficient, and safe airspace and airportal systems that will enable the Next Generation Air Transportation System, as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office. 2. Description Under this RFI, NASA solicits interest primarily from industry to collaborate at the systems level in Fundamental Aeronautics. NASA seeks to enter into research collaborations that benefit both industry and NASA, and NASA intends to use its authority under the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (“Space Act”), to enter into non-reimbursable agreements where each party funds their own participation in the research effort. One or more initial agreements are anticipated. NASA is particularly interested in collaborating with industry consortia, and responses from existing or proposed consortia are encouraged. While educational institutions may also respond to this RFI, it is anticipated that a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting participation by educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and companies engaged in foundational research will be issued in early 2006. The Fundamental Aeronautics Program encompasses core capabilities in the four (4) thrust areas of Subsonic Fixed Wing, Subsonic Rotary Wing, Supersonics and Hypersonics. See Appendix A for a more detailed description of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program. Fundamental Aeronautics also supports NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration by providing key aeronautical capabilities that can be adapted for high-speed vehicles exiting and entering the atmosphere of our planet as well as operating throughout the atmospheres of other planetary bodies such as Mars. This RFI solicits proposed research collaborations that are appropriate to NASA’s unique capabilities. NASA intends long-term support in the thrust areas described above. NASA intends to focus its resources on fundamental technology and build upon that investment to develop system-level, multidisciplinary capabilities that enable both civilian and military platforms of the future. As NASA does not typically build or operate military or commercial aircraft, we seek partnerships with industry at the systems level. Consistent with the Space Act, a key element of the restructured Aeronautics program is that the Nation’s aeronautical expertise and unique facilities are maintained as national assets for the benefit of both civilian and military aeronautics applications.  3. Process NASA Headquarters oversees the Aeronautics Research Programs and implementation occurs principally at four NASA field centers (Ames Research Center, Langley Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Dryden Flight Research Center). In Fiscal Year 2006 a four-step process will be used to define the Aeronautics Research Programs: Step 1: Assess the long-term research needs and goals in the Fundamental Aeronautics program and establish technical roadmaps to accomplish those goals. In developing those roadmaps, prioritize according to NASA’s unique strengths and capabilities. Establish multi-center, multidisciplinary teams across the areas of Subsonic Fixed Wing, Subsonic Rotary Wing, Supersonics, and Hypersonics. These roadmaps will be discussed further at the 44th American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 9-12, 2006 in Reno, Nevada. Step 2: Solicit information through this RFI on the key areas of interest from the external community and determine potential areas to form collaborative arrangements. Step 3: Develop research proposals at the field centers in each of the four thrust areas and establish NASA research teams. The responses to this RFI will provide important source material to the NASA research teams to be used in establishing specific collaborative partnerships as part of their proposals to NASA Headquarters. Step 4: NASA intends to issue NASA Research Announcements (NRA, see NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Part 35) to solicit proposals for foundational research in areas where NASA needs to enhance its core capabilities. Foundational research is defined as research that furthers our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics, chemistry, materials, etc. NASA anticipates that educational institutions, non-profit organizations and industry engaged in foundational research will be the primary recipients of awards under the NRA. 4. Information for Respondents 4.1 How to Respond NASA anticipates providing additional information about its Aeronautics Research Programs on or about January 12, 2006, at the AIAA conference in Reno, Nevada. NASA also anticipates providing this additional information on the following website: www.aeronautics.nasa.gov. The website above will be used to post information about, or modifications to, this RFI. Prospective respondents are urged to periodically check this web site for updates. Respondents are requested to provide a description of a proposed non-reimbursable partnership between NASA and industry. Responses shall describe: (1) the respondent’s team and expertise, key personnel and capabilities, and the R&D collaboration approach and areas of interest; (2) respondent’s facilities and resources (including test data) to be provided as part of the collaboration; and (3) what is expected or requested of NASA as part of the collaboration (including Government facilities or other resources). Partnerships will be limited to US companies. Of particular interest are industry consortia focused on intellectual collaboration at the systems level in one of the four Fundamental Aeronautics Program thrust areas. Responses must be a maximum of five (5) pages, with minimum 12-point Times font. All proposals shall include the company name, point-of-contact, address, and phone number. All proposals shall clearly indicate which one of the four thrust areas in the Fundamental Aeronautics Program is addressed in the proposed partnership, by placing the name of one program thrust (either “Subsonic Fixed Wing”, “Subsonic Rotary Wing”, “Supersonics”, or “Hypersonics”) in the upper right hand corner of each page in your proposal. All proposals shall include an e-mail address for the point-of-contact in order to expedite communications. All questions posed by email shall get a response. Please submit all responses in electronic format to the Point-of-Contact listed below by NOON Eastern Standard Time, January 31, 2006: Name:		Mr. Herb Schlickenmaier Title:		Deputy Director, Fundamental Aeronautics Phone:		202-358-4638 Email:		rfi_fa@nasa.gov Questions regarding this RFI should also be addressed to the above Point-of-Contact. 4.2 Evaluation Factors The evaluation process NASA intends to use for selecting collaborative partnerships (under non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement[s]) has been designed for this RFI. Respondents are reminded that this process does not involve the procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) nor the NASA FAR supplement since this announcement will not result in the award of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement. Responses will be assessed on the following evaluation factors: •	Overall responsiveness to furthering the goals of this RFI, in particular the objectives and results-oriented goals of NASA’s Fundamental Aeronautics Program. •	Management Confidence in the structure and management of the proposed collaborative activity through the formation of Industry consortia. •	Technical Confidence in the research proposed under the collaborative activity on system level topics. •	Interest in long-term, rather than short-term research. The NASA Point-of-Contact referenced in Section 4.1 will provide the RFI responses to the NASA planning lead of the thrust area identified by the respondent. Based upon assessment of the responses, as part of the process of submitting proposals under Step 3 (see “Process” above), the planning leads may contact RFI respondents to finalize terms and conditions of agreements. 4.3 General Information 4.3.1 Proprietary or Confidential Information Respondents are NOT to provide any information that is considered proprietary, trade secrets, or privileged or confidential. 4.3.2 Intellectual Property Intellectual property rights between NASA and collaboration partners can be negotiated to fit the goals of the parties. Under NASA’s standard approach, title to inventions remain with the respective inventing parties without any exchange of rights unless otherwise agreed.  Proprietary data developed and provided by the collaboration partner to NASA remains proprietary. NASA takes no rights in background inventions or data developed prior to or outside of collaborative agreements under this RFI. NASA requires that consortia and teams agree to intellectual property rights among members prior to finalizing terms and conditions of a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement. Respondents to this RFI may comment on this general approach and/or suggest alternate approaches to intellectual property rights between NASA and the partner. 4.3.3 Compliance with U.S. Laws, Regulations, and Policies Proposals must comply with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations and policies. 4.3.4 Use of Government Resources In support of this RFI, the Government will consider requests from respondents for Government furnished resources and technologies. Requests for use of Government equipment, facilities or services should be provided to the Point-of-Contact for this RFI. 4.3.5 Period of Performance The Government anticipates that proposed research collaborations under Space Act Agreements will have an initial period of performance of five (5) years, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties 4.3.6 RFI Issuance and Response Selection NASA will not issue paper copies of this RFI. NASA reserves the right to select for negotiations all, some, or none of the proposed collaborative partnerships in response to this RFI.  APPENDIX A: Information on FUNDAMENTAL AERONAUTICS The Fundamental Aeronautics Program is dedicated to the mastery and intellectual stewardship of the core competencies of Aeronautics for the Nation across all flight regimes. NASA will focus the research in areas that are appropriate to our unique capabilities. The research is long-term and is both focused and integrated across disciplines. NASA will invest broadly and deeply in the core competencies of aeronautics, producing knowledge, technology, and tools that are applicable across a broad range of air vehicles. NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development: (1) conduct foundational research to further our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and our ability model that physics, (2) leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions, (3) integrate methods and technologies to develop multi-disciplinary solutions, and (4) solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. Interaction with the aeronautics community aligns with the four levels. The first three levels reflect relationships with the aeronautics community in which NASA seeks to ensure the national aeronautical technical expertise: (1) NASA will advance the state of knowledge of the underlying physics and its modeling by partnering with universities and companies engaged in foundational research where that partnership supplements NASA capabilities, (2) NASA will investigate discipline-related challenges and will interact with the aeronautics community through published reports and direct technology transfer, and (3) NASA will develop multi-disciplinary methods and technologies, and disseminate them in published reports and direct technology transfer. The interaction with the aeronautics community at the systems level is unique because NASA typically does not design and build air vehicles for operational use. We look toward collaboration with industry to provide insight into issues associated with flight, manufacturing and design. NASA’s role at this level is to develop multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization tools based on the underlying physics. NASA intends to collaborate with industry consortia to provide value to industry of a more enduring nature, rather than immediate design and manufacturing problem-solving. The following four thrust areas describe the objective, anticipated results and more detailed areas of investment for Subsonic Fixed Wing, Subsonic Rotary Wing, Supersonics and Hypersonics. A.1 SUBSONIC FIXED WING OBJECTIVE: Perform foundational research in materials and structures, tribology, power and combustion, dynamics and control, aeroacoustics, aerodynamics, aerothermo¬dynamics, and experimental methods to enable revolutionary capabilities in propulsion and power systems, vehicle systems integration and analysis, airframe systems, and systems for experimental validation, which will ultimately yield multidisciplinary analysis and optimization capabilities that will enable system-level design of a wide class of air vehicles that are aligned with the Environment objectives in the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems plan and meet the performance challenges of the future for both the civilian and military applications.

Background The NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has recently restructured its Aeronautics Research into three separate programs: Fundamental Aeronautics, Aviation Safety, and Airspace Systems. The specific purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit external interest in collaborative public-private research partnerships under NASA’s Aviation Safety Program: Aviation Safety Program: This program will build upon the unique safety-related research capabilities of NASA to improve aircraft safety for current and future civilian and military aircraft, and to overcome aircraft safety technological barriers that would otherwise constrain the full realization of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. This program will also provide long-term investment in research to support and sustain expert competency in critical core areas of aviation and aircraft safety. While not part of this RFI, separate RFIs will also be issued for NASA’s other two Aeronautics Research programs: Airspace Systems Program: The top-level goal of this program is the development of high capacity, efficient, and safe airspace and airportal systems that will enable the Next Generation Air Transportation System, as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office.  Fundamental Aeronautics Program: The top-level goal of this program is the development of system-level, multi-disciplinary capabilities for both the civilian and military applications. This program provides long-term investment in research to support and sustain expert competency in critical core areas of aeronautics technology.  2. Description Under this RFI, NASA solicits interest from primarily industry in entering into collaborative research in Aviation Safety that benefits both NASA and industry. NASA intends to use its authority under the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (“Space Act”), to enter into non-reimbursable agreements where each party funds their own participation in the research effort. One or more initial agreements are anticipated. Responses from individual or industry teams, including existing or proposed consortia, are sought. Of particular interest are industry consortia to enhance NASA's research portfolio that will lead to revolutionary system-level capabilities. While educational institutions may also respond to this RFI, it is anticipated that a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting participation by educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and companies engaged in foundational research will be issued in early 2006. This RFI seeks potential sources that have an interest in non-reimbursable collaborative R&D activities that address current, emerging, and future aircraft safety technical challenges facing both military and civil operators. The four (4) thrust areas established for the Aviation Safety Program are Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM), Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC), Aircraft Aging and Durability (AAD), and Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck (IIFD) Technologies. See Appendix A for additional detail on the Aviation Safety Program and each thrust area.  NASA intends to provide long-term support in the thrust areas above and focus its resources on fundamental aircraft safety research and technology development that enables multidisciplinary and system-level capabilities. The anticipated outcome from these investments is an expanded knowledge base to overcome aircraft safety technological barriers that would otherwise constrain the realization of future capabilities of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. As NASA does not typically build or operate military or commercial aircraft, we look toward partnerships with industry to help us identify emerging safety concerns and advance the technologies to continually improve aircraft safety. Consistent with the Space Act, a key element of the restructured Aeronautics program is that the Nation’s aeronautical expertise and unique facilities are maintained as national assets for the benefit of both the civilian and military aeronautics communities.  3. Process NASA Headquarters oversees the Aeronautics Research Programs and implementation occurs principally at four NASA field centers (Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Langley Research Center). In Fiscal Year 2006 a four-step process will be used to define the Aeronautics Research Programs: Step 1: Assess the long-term research needs and goals in the Aviation Safety Program and establish technical roadmaps to accomplish those goals. In developing those roadmaps, prioritize according to NASA’s unique strengths and capabilities. Establish multi-center, multidisciplinary teams across the areas of IVHM, AAD, IRAC, and IIFD Technologies. These roadmaps will be discussed further at the 44th American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 9-12, 2006 in Reno, Nevada. Step 2: Solicit information through this RFI on the key areas of interest from the external community and determine potential areas to form collaborative arrangements.  Step 3: Develop research proposals at the field centers in each of the four thrust areas and establish NASA research teams. The responses to this RFI will provide important source material to the NASA research teams to be used in establishing specific collaborative partnerships as part of their proposals to NASA Headquarters. Step 4: NASA intends to issue NASA Research Announcements (NRA, see NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Part 35) to solicit proposals for foundational research in areas where NASA needs to enhance its core capabilities. Foundational research is defined as research that furthers our fundamental understanding of the underlying principles associated with complex safety-related problems. NASA anticipates that educational institutions, non-profit organizations and industry engaged in foundational research will be the primary recipients of awards under the NRA.  4.

APPENDIX A: Information on AVIATION SAFETY NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development in each of the four Aviation Safety thrust areas: (1) conduct foundational research to enable a detailed understanding of the underlying principles associated with the complex safety-related problems being addressed and to enable disciplinary advances to address those problems; (2) leverage the foundational research to develop methods, tools and technology components that enable the development and validation of technology solutions; (3) develop integrated methods, tools, and technology subsystems that enable the development and validation of multidisciplinary technology solutions to address multiple safety hazards and their coupled effects; and (4) develop and validate technology solutions that utilize system-level multidisciplinary optimization, assessment, and integration methods to address a broad range of safety challenges and air vehicles.  The Aviation Safety Program is committed to the mastery and intellectual stewardship of aircraft safety foundational research and technology development for the Nation. NASA will focus its research in areas that are appropriate to our unique capabilities, and will partner with industry, academia, and other government agencies in complementary areas of research. NASA research is long-term and cutting-edge and is both focused and integrated across disciplines. NASA will invest broadly and deeply in core aircraft safety research at Levels 1 and 2, to produce knowledge, technology, and tools that are applicable across a broad range of air vehicles. It is anticipated that collaborative activities with industry partners will occur mainly at Levels 3 and 4 in a manner to identify and optimally address emerging safety challenges facing the Nation’s Next Generation Air Transportation System.  The interaction with the aeronautics and aviation safety community at the systems level is of particular importance because NASA typically does not design and build air vehicles for operational use, and has limited operational experience that is targeted to experimental research. We look toward collaboration with industry to provide insight into issues associated with design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance of aircraft and associated systems. NASA’s role at this level is to use its expertise in relevant disciplines to develop multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization tools that will help resolve these issues. NASA intends to collaborate with industry consortia to provide value to industry of a more enduring nature, rather than immediate problem-solving.  Recent collaborations with industry have been very successful and NASA hopes to continue this tradition. These collaborations can fill a critical need with respect to future vehicle health management, control, and flight deck concepts, their practicality, and their validation. Additionally, sharing access to test facilities, aircraft, and equipment for testing in relevant environments is of interest to NASA. For all collaborations, temporary exchanges of personnel and the sharing of test facilities, aircraft, and equipment for testing in relevant environments are also of interest to NASA. The following four (4) thrust areas describe the objective, anticipated results and potential NASA investment areas for AAD, IIFD Technologies, IVHN, and IRAC.

Background The NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has recently restructured NASA’s aeronautics research into three separate programs: Airspace Systems, Aviation Safety, and Fundamental Aeronautics. The specific purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit external interest in collaborative, public-private research partnerships under NASA’s Airspace Systems Program: Airspace Systems Program: The top-level goal of this program is the development of high capacity, efficient, and safe airspace and airportal systems that will enable the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). While not part of this RFI, separate RFIs will also be issued for two other NASA aeronautics research programs: Fundamental Aeronautics Program: The top-level goal of this program is the development of system-level, multi-disciplinary capabilities for both civilian and military applications. This program provides long-term investment in research to support and sustain expert competency in critical core areas of aeronautics technology.  Aviation Safety Program: This program will build upon the unique safety-related research capabilities of NASA to improve aircraft safety for current and future civilian and military aircraft, and to overcome aircraft safety technological barriers that would otherwise constrain the full realization of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. This program will also provide long-term investment in research to support and sustain expert competency in critical core areas of aviation and aircraft safety. 2. Description Under this RFI, NASA solicits interest primarily from industry to collaborate at the systems level in Airspace Systems. NASA seeks to enter into research collaborations that benefit both industry and NASA and intends to use its authority under the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended (“Space Act”), to enter into non-reimbursable agreements where each party funds its own participation in the research effort. One or more agreements are anticipated and will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Responses from individual or industry teams, including existing or proposed consortia, are encouraged. Of particular interest are industry consortia to help NASA develop a research portfolio that will lead to revolutionary system level capabilities that can be feasibly implemented to enable the NGATS. While academia may respond to this RFI, it is anticipated that a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) soliciting participation by educational institutions and companies engaged in basic research will be issued in early 2006. This RFI seeks information from potential sources that have an interest in non-reimbursable collaborative R&D activities that address future and emerging airspace capacity and airportal issues in support of the NGATS. The Airspace Systems Program is addressing these issues through the NGATS Airspace Project and NGATS Airportal Project that will leverage core capabilities in adaptive air-ground and air-air automation, airspace/airportal simulation and modeling, experimentation and validation, and systems analysis and integration. See Appendix A for additional detail on the Airspace Systems Program and each project.  NASA intends to provide long-term support for the project areas discussed above, to focus its resources on fundamental airspace and airportal technology, and to build upon that investment to develop system-level, multidisciplinary technologies that will enable the NGATS. The RFI solicits proposals that complement NASA’s fundamental technology developments by extending the work to a system-wide level, including operational considerations. Consistent with the Space Act, a key element of the restructured aeronautics program is to ensure that the nation’s aeronautical expertise and unique facilities are maintained as national assets for the benefit of both the civilian and military aeronautics communities.  3. Process NASA Headquarters oversees the Aeronautics Research Programs and implementation occurs principally at four NASA field centers (Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Langley Research Center). In Fiscal Year 2006 a four-step process will be used to define the aeronautics research programs: Step 1: Assess the long-term research needs and goals in the Airspace Systems Program and establish technical roadmaps to accomplish those goals. In developing those roadmaps, prioritize according to NASA’s unique strengths and capabilities. Establish multi-center, multidisciplinary teams across the NGATS Airspace and NGATS Airportal projects. These roadmaps will be discussed further at the 44th American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 9-12, 2006 in Reno, Nevada. Step 2: Solicit information through this RFI on the key areas of interest from the external community and determine potential areas to form collaborative arrangements.  Step 3: Develop research proposals by the field centers in each of the two thrust areas and establish NASA research teams. The responses to this RFI will provide important source material to the NASA proposal teams to be used in establishing specific collaborative partnerships as part of their proposals to NASA Headquarters. Step 4: NASA intends to issue NASA Research Announcements (NRA, see NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Part 35) to solicit proposals for foundational research in areas where NASA needs to enhance its core capabilities. Foundational research is defined as research that furthers our fundamental understanding of the underlying principles associated with complex airspace problems. NASA anticipates that educational institutions, non-profit organizations and industry engaged in foundational research will be the primary recipients of awards under the NRA.  4. Information for Respondents 4.1 How to Respond NASA anticipates providing additional information about its Aeronautics Research Programs on or about January 12, 2006, at the AIAA conference in Reno, Nevada. NASA also anticipates providing this additional information on the following website: www.aeronautics.nasa.gov. The website above will be used to post information about, or modifications to, this RFI. Prospective respondents are urged to periodically check this web site for updates. Respondents are requested to provide a description of a proposed non-reimbursable partnership between NASA and industry. Responses shall describe: (1) the respondent’s team and expertise, key personnel and capabilities, and the R&D collaboration approach and areas of interest; (2) respondent’s facilities and resources (including test data) to be provided as part of the collaboration; and (3) what is expected or requested of NASA as part of the collaboration (including Government facilities or other resources). Partnerships will be limited to US companies. The proposal must be a maximum of five (5) pages, with minimum 12-point Times font. All proposals shall clearly indicate which one of the two thrust areas in the Airspace Systems Program is addressed in the proposed partnership, by placing the name of one program thrust (either “NGATS Airspace” or “NGATS Airportal”) in the upper right hand corner of each page in your proposal. All proposals shall include an e-mail address for the point-of-contact in order to expedite communications. All questions posed by email shall get a response. Please submit all responses in electronic format to the Point-of-Contact listed below by NOON Eastern Standard Time, January 31, 2006: Name:		Dr. John Cavolowsky Title:		Deputy Program Manager for Technical Integration, Airspace Systems Program Phone:		650-604-4434 Email:		rfi_asp@nasa.gov Questions regarding this RFI should also be addressed to the above Point-of-Contact. 4.2 Evaluation Factors The evaluation process NASA intends to use for selecting collaborative partnerships (under non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement[s]) has been designed for this RFI. Respondents are reminded that this process does not involve the procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) nor the NASA FAR supplement since this announcement will not result in the award of a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement. Responses will be assessed on the following evaluation factors: •	Overall responsiveness to furthering the goals of this RFI, in particular the objectives and results-oriented goals of NASA’s Airspace Systems Program. •	Technical confidence in the research proposed under the collaborative activity. •	Management confidence in the structure and management of the proposed collaborative activity. The NASA Point-of-Contact referenced in Section 4.1 will provide the RFI responses to the NASA planning lead of the thrust area identified by the respondent. Based upon assessment of the responses, as part of the process of submitting proposals under Step 3 (see “Process” above), the planning leads may contact RFI respondents to finalize terms and conditions of agreements. 4.3 General Information 4.3.1 Proprietary or Confidential Information Respondents are NOT to provide any information that is considered proprietary, trade secrets, or privileged or confidential. 4.3.2 Intellectual Property Intellectual property rights between NASA and collaboration partners can be negotiated to fit the goals of the parties. Under NASA’s standard approach, title to inventions remain with the respective inventing parties without any exchange of rights unless otherwise agreed.  Proprietary data developed and provided by the collaboration partner to NASA remains proprietary. NASA takes no rights in background inventions or data developed prior to or outside of collaborative agreements under this RFI. NASA requires that consortia and teams agree to intellectual property rights among members prior to finalizing terms and conditions of a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement. Respondents to this RFI may comment on this general approach and/or suggest alternate approaches to intellectual property rights between NASA and the partner. 4.3.3 Compliance with U.S. Laws, Regulations, and Policies Proposals must comply with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations and policies. 4.3.4 Use of Government Resources In support of this RFI, the Government will consider requests from respondents for Government furnished resources and technologies. Requests for use of Government equipment, facilities or services should be provided to the Point-of-Contact for this RFI. 4.3.5 Period of Performance The Government anticipates that proposed research collaborations under Space Act Agreements will have an initial period of performance of five (5) years, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties 4.3.6 RFI Issuance and Response Selection NASA will not issue paper copies of this RFI. NASA reserves the right to select for negotiations all, some, or none of the proposed collaborative partnerships in response to this RFI.  APPENDIX A: Information on AIRSPACE SYSTEMS NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development and integration and will conduct research across each of these levels to address evolving air transportation system challenges: At Level 1, NASA will conduct foundational research to further the fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and an ability to model that physics. At Level 2, NASA will leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions relative to next generation airspace and airportal issues. At Level 3, NASA will seek to integrate multi-disciplinary methods and technologies to balance solutions across disciplines. At Level 4, NASA will build upon results from activities in Level 1 through Level 3 to support the development of high capacity, efficient, and safe airspace and airportal systems that will enable the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The Airspace Systems Program is dedicated to the mastery and intellectual stewardship of airspace and airportal foundational research and discipline-based technology development for the nation. NASA will focus the research in areas that are appropriate to the Agency’s unique capabilities. NASA research is long-term and cutting edge and is both focused and integrated across disciplines. NASA will invest broadly and deeply in integrated solutions for a safe, efficient, high-capacity airspace system in the air and on the ground at Levels 1 and 2, our key investment areas. It is anticipated that collaborative activities with industry partners will occur mainly at Level 3 and 4 in a manner to identify and optimally address emerging and future airspace and airportal issues associated with enabling the NGATS.  The interaction with the aeronautics and aviation capacity community at the systems level (Levels 3 and 4) is unique because NASA does not build or implement air traffic management systems. NASA looks toward collaborations associated with system-level design and operation to ensure our ability to provide integrated solutions for safe, efficient, high capacity airspace and airportal systems. NASA intends to collaborate with industry consortia to provide value to industry of a more enduring nature, rather than immediate problem solving.  Collaboration at the lower levels of research is also possible; however NASA anticipates focusing a significant portion of its core competencies and resources to these research areas and will be interested in research by others that fill gaps and deficiencies in NASA research.  A.1 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AIRSPACE SYSTEMS & COLLABORATION INTERESTS The following five technology development areas describe the objective, anticipated results and potential investment areas for the NGATS Airspace Project and the NGATS Airportal Project: (1) The “Evaluator”; (2) Four-dimensional (4-D) trajectory operations; (3) automated separation assurance; (4) dynamic airspace configuration; and (5) super-density surface and terminal area traffic optimization. A.1.1 The Evaluator: Research is needed to develop a software-based concept developed by the JPDO called the “Evaluator” to support a future decision-making environment in the air and on the ground. The Evaluator is expected to employ 4-D trajectory proposals from all airspace and airportal users, assess them for compatibility with airspace system capacity, and produce conflict-free trajectory contracts. The Evaluator will continually update the contracts with position and intent data for each aircraft in the National Airspace System (NAS). Users will be able to view projected and actual conflicts and negotiate their resolution in real time. Air traffic management service providers will be able to plan airspace configurations and allocate resources in real time based on changing needs. Based on a set of jointly determined rules, the service provider will also provide final arbitration decisions when users are unable to resolve conflicts. A.1.2 Four-dimensional trajectory-based operations: Research is needed to develop systems, tools, and procedures for using time-based flight paths from beginning-to-end (including ground segments) to improve system efficiency while maintaining safety, security, and environmental compatibility. Research is needed to produce real-time 4-D trajectory calculations to meet multiple objectives (separation assurance, time, fuel efficiency, low emissions, etc.). Solutions must also integrate the Evaluator and 4-D trajectory-based operations with safe surface traffic optimization tools and systems. A.1.3 Automated separation assurance: Research is needed to develop systems, tools, and procedures to delegate separation assurance functions to automatic systems on the ground and in the cockpit, thus offloading controllers to focus on solving strategic control problems, optimizing traffic flow during changing weather conditions, accommodating pilot requests for route changes, and other events. Solutions must integrate automated separation assurance methods with centralized and de-centralized control, and enable the use of automated separation to accommodate mixed equipage operations. Methods are needed to predict, detect and resolve conflicts; prevent runway incursions; and ensure graceful degradation and recovery from failure of automated separation in a centralized and/or de-centralized system. Research is also needed to balance arrivals and departures in terminal airspace.  A.1.4 Dynamic airspace configuration: Research is needed to develop a new framework for airspace allocation that no longer relies on navigational aids and sectors, and instead allocates airspace as a resource to meet demand while meeting safety and environmental requirements. Methodologies are needed for quickly designing airspace configurations to accommodate user trajectories while dynamically reconfiguring airspace in real-time during daily operations. Airspace configurations will be driven by national security and defense requirements (Departments of Defense and Homeland Security), domestic and international user needs, special-use airspace requirements, safety, environmental compatibility, and NAS efficiency.  A.1.5 Super-density surface and terminal area traffic optimization: Research is needed to develop distributed air-ground solutions that safely integrate surface and air portal traffic optimization tools and systems with the Evaluator and 4-D trajectory operations. Solutions must support equivalent visual operations in all conditions. Super-density surface and terminal area traffic optimization will leverage adaptive air-ground automation tools to enhance ground-operation situational awareness, traffic flow management tools to improve throughput, collaborative decision making tools to enhance efficiency, and runway incursion prevention tools to maintain safety. Other tools are necessary to balance arrivals and departures and enable dynamic terminal airportal configurations. Other tools for detecting and avoiding wake vortices with greater accuracy and precision are needed to enable significant reductions in separation between aircraft during take off and landing while minimizing environmental impacts A.2 PROJECTS Consistent with those NGATS technology development areas, the Airspace Systems Program will focus on two major projects: NGATS Airspace and NGATS Airportal. The projects are organized by domain requiring substantially similar discipline capabilities to provide their unique deliverables. To that end, fundamental capabilities developed in one project will be leveraged for the benefit of the other to make efficient use of Airspace Systems Program resources. Deliverables from each project will be integrated for gate-to-gate solutions. Prioritization of specific research activities associated with each project will be vetted with the JPDO.  A.2.1 NGATS Airspace Project: This project addresses the following technology development areas as defined by the JPDO:  •	The Evaluator at a strategic NAS-level; •	4-D trajectory-based operations at a strategic NAS-level; •	Automated separation assurance; and •	Dynamic airspace configuration. COLLABORATION INTERESTS: In order to address these technology development areas, NASA seeks industry collaboration on system-level capabilities in the following areas: Integrated Adaptive Air and Ground Automation Concepts and Technologies: Traffic flow management, separation assurance, collaborative decision-making, shared situational awareness, centralized and/or distributed control, air-to-ground and air-to-air information sharing, dynamic airspace design, and 4-D trajectory operations and performance-based operations. Airspace Modeling and Simulation: Tools development, multi-agent modeling, advanced concept modeling, safety and failure analysis, and fast-time simulation. System Analysis and Integration: Airspace requirements definition; integration and architecture; and system engineering and analysis. A.2.2 NGATS Airportal Project: The NGATS Airportal Project will address technology development in three areas:  •	The Evaluator at the terminal and airport surface level; •	4-D trajectory-based operations at the terminal and airport surface level; and •	Super-density surface and terminal area traffic optimization. COLLABORATION INTERESTS: In order to address these technology development areas, NASA seeks industry collaboration on system-level capabilities in the following areas:  Integrated Adaptive Air and Ground Automation Concepts and Technologies: Traffic flow management, separation and spacing assurance, collaborative decision-making, shared situational awareness, wake and other hazard definition, efficient and safe wake spacing, runway incursion prevention, closely spaced parallel approaches, arrivals and departures balancing, dynamic terminal and airportal configurations, surface traffic optimization, and integrated regional airportal accessibility and design. Airportal Modeling and Simulation: Tools development, multi-agent modeling, advanced concept modeling, safety and failure analysis, and fast-time simulation. System Analysis and Integration: Airportal requirements definition; integration and architecture; system engineering and analysis.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide access to data on health care practitioner prescribing practices including, but not limited to, patient demographics and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting.  FDA requires access to such data to obtain national estimates or counts.

The overall data characteristics provided shall include:  the number of health care practitioners (e.g., physicians, physician’s assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists), visits, and patients; characterization of individual health care practitioners in terms of number, specialty, practice setting, age, gender, geographic region and U.S. Census region.  Additionally, potential offerors shall provide a characterization of the practice setting of health care practitioners in terms of type of facility (e.g., surgi-centers, staff model HMOs, clinics), geographic region and U.S. Census region (desired, but not required).  Where possible, potential offerors shall provide a comparison to national figures.

The data resource shall be accessible via a secure Internet or network-based method.  Potential offerors shall provide the following:  a method of access for examining visit-level prescribing data for products linked to clinical or medical data on indication shall be specified in detail; a method of access for examining data on visits for specified diseases or medical conditions, and associated treatments, if any; the ability to capture all drugs prescribed to treat the same diagnosis as well as all drugs mentioned during the visit regardless of diagnosis; interface documentation (e.g., white paper, training manual) the ability to receive e-mail confirmation when reports are complete, if applicable; a method and frequency for updating interface; a method of simultaneous, multi-user access; a past history of scheduled and unscheduled downtime of data; and the number and nature of limits to access, including numbers of users, numbers and types of data elements.

Technical Requirements and Capabilities
A.	The patient-level and/or visit-level data shall be a currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant product that shall provide immediate automated access with the capability of providing characterization of health care practitioner prescribing practices including but not limited to patient demographics, and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting.
B.	The data shall be a currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant product that shall provide immediate automated access with the capability of providing both current and historical national-level prescribing practice information. 
C.	Access to the data shall be immediate, unlimited, direct, desktop and in real-time.  Access shall include all upgrades, enhancements, and modifications to software and data. 
D.	Access shall be via secure Internet or network-based methods and shall be in a multi-user environment. The network-based methods shall not necessitate any additions to the FDA communications infrastructure.  FDA shall not support modem-based or dial-up access.  Additionally, FDA shall not support or maintain potential offerors’s equipment or personnel on premises.
E.	Potential offerors shall provide documentation addressing the stability of their business contracts or agreements with their data suppliers over the course of this proposed contract with the FDA.
F.	In the event of changes to the potential offerors’ business contracts or agreements with their data suppliers, FDA shall be notified within 5 business days of the potential offerors becoming aware of such changes, detailing the impact of these changes on data quality, data quantity, and overall data characteristics.
G.	Access shall be through an interface and this interface shall be user-friendly, transparent and flexible enough to meet the FDA’s needs.  Minimally, the interface shall provide both predefined (e.g., canned) and custom reports.
H.	FDA requires the ability to make national estimates of visit-based and/or patient-based outpatient health care practitioner prescribing practices using a mutually agreed upon projection or other appropriate methodologies, which shall be valid, reliable, and robust with regard to prescribing practices specifically, and the methods fully disclosed.  If such methodology has not been developed, a commitment in the form of a detailed development plan, strategic outline and timeline to collaborate with FDA investigators to develop and implement a mutually acceptable method for making national estimates within 6 months shall be provided as part of the written technical proposal.  
I.	Full disclosure of data collection and projection methodology and a complete, up-to-date data dictionary shall be required as part of the technical proposal to allow FDA staff to appropriately evaluate and interpret the data and its source.  All proprietary information provided as part of the technical proposal shall be kept confidential.  
J.	The FDA shall have the ability to archive and analyze historical data in a timely manner. 
K.	The FDA shall have the ability to download  (or obtain in a timely manner using other means) and analyze patient level data (desired but not required).  FDA’s preference is that unrestricted access to  datasets shall be available on demand and without intervention by the Potential offerors.
L.	All data shall be HIPAA-compliant.  No patient, practitioner, or health plan-specific identifiers will be required by FDA.  It shall be solely the potential offerors’ responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.
M.	As part of its regulatory activities, FDA will, at times, require disclosure of scientific and technical articles, study results, presentations, public health advisories, and similar works involving summarized data to entities outside the Agency including the general public.  Any proposed disclosure policy shall include a provision that with the expiration of the contract, the potential offeror shall continue processing clearance requests on data that was obtained during the contract period.  This provision accounts for the time involved in the evaluation of a drug safety issue, i.e. data extraction, analyses, and formulation of a regulatory position. Any proposed disclosure policy documentation shall be provided with the submission of the potential offerors proposal and will require FDA legal review and approval upon award of contract.
N.	A proposed process shall be provided for allowing FDA to share project specific summarized or raw data with third parties for collaborative research projects of public health importance that are initiated by and for the benefit of FDA.  This process shall allow FDA to share data in a timely manner.  Any third party non-disclosure documentation shall be provided with the submission of the Potential offerors's proposal and will require FDA legal review and approval upon award of contract 
O.	Post-award training of FDA staff and written documentation related to using the data shall be required.  Training for users of the data, as well as training for FDA personnel who will support use of the data (e.g., technical users) shall also be required.  Potential offerors shall provide course outlines for all levels of training and the number of sessions offered, including at least one annual training session offered on site at FDA and options for additional “on-demand” sessions either in person or via web-based methods.
P.	Ongoing technical, analytical, and clinical support shall be required throughout the length of the contract.
Q.	Short-term trial subscription access to the currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant data, via secure Internet or network-based methods, shall be provided to a maximum of four FDA researchers from the Project Advisory Group (PAG) for evaluation of product performance, at no cost to the FDA.  FDA evaluators shall have access to use the tool for a minimum of 30 days to conduct drug-, condition- or demographic-specific queries to demonstrate the completeness, efficiency and ease of using the product.  During this short-term trial access period, the FDA shall only use the data for the purposes of evaluation of the data.  FDA shall not use the data, nor any analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.  The Potential offerors shall provide a fully executed Trial Subscription Agreement (Attachment 1) with the submission of the Potential offerors's technical proposal.  
R.	FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages no later than November 10, 2005 to one of the following addresses:  Via U.S. Mail: Food and Drug Administration, OAGS/DSCI/HFA-500 Attn: Katharine Minker, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

Event details are planned as follows:  When: February 9, 2006 from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM.  Where:  at the Sheraton Miami Mart Hotel, Miami, Florida.  The purpose of this initial Industry Day meeting is to provide the FMCSA an opportunity to communicate to industry its objectives and expectation for the Motor Carrier Efficiency Study; and enlist industry input on this Congressionally directed study.  Specifically, the FMCSA seeks to obtain information relative to supply chain management and wireless technology capabilities to improve the safety and productivity of motor carrier freight transportation including intermodal operations, cross-border movements, and points of freight interchange.  The Motor Carrier Efficiency Study, as specified in the Section 5503 of  the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU)  transportation authorization legislation, will address the following areas; identify inefficiencies in the transportation of freight; evaluate the safety, productivity, and increased cost savings that may be achieved through the use of wireless technologies to address the inefficiencies in the transportation of freight; and, conduct field tests demonstrating how wireless technologies will improve inefficiencies.  

In conjunction with the study criteria, the following program element will have to be considered: fuel monitoring and management systems, radio frequency identification technology, electronic manifest systems, cargo theft prevention and roadside inspection systems.  The specific task of the requirement include the following: conduct a study of freight inefficiencies; develop a concept of operations requirements and test plan; develop a system design document; conduct field operational test; support the data collection for the independent evaluation; conduct data collection and analysis; and, provide input to annual report to Congress.  There will be an independent evaluation and analysis of the wireless technologies data and field operation test. This study also requires a final report which will summarize the freight study, technology demonstration findings, experiences and lessons learned during the four year program duration. Pre-registration for the Industry Day is required.  For reservations, email the following information to Sec5503MeetingRegistration@fmcsa.dot.gov: name, company, telephone and fax numbers, and email address no later than January 20, 2006.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number RFQ-06-120 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-06.  The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 541620 and the size standard is 6mil.  This procurement is being issued as 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  

The Bureau of the Public Debt has a requirement for In-door Air Quality Testing.  We are requesting a quote for an option year contract consisting of a base year and two (2) option years.  Award will be based upon technically compliant low price.  The following Statement of Work describes the required tasks that the contractor must perform.

STATEMENT OF WORK
IN-DOOR AIR QUALITY TEST

SCOPE:

The Contractor shall conduct in-door air quality testing for airflow, temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and ozone. The test shall be performed with industry standard in-door air quality testing equipment (to include airflow measuring devices to properly fit HVAC air output and return vents that are 2 feet by 2 feet, and 4 feet by 8 inches). The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, and supplies required to conduct a yearly in-door air quality testing.

The contractor shall also assess the overall operation of the HVAC systems of the occupied building and provide summaries of these assessments. Testing shall be completed within one week of the start date. The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) shall be notified two weeks prior to the anticipated start date. It is anticipated that for the first year testing will be conducted during the winter, with subsequent years to be determined by the COTR and contractor in order to provide an assessment of air quality during other periods of the year.

Tests shall be conducted in the space occupied by Public Debt in the following buildings:

·	200 Third Street Building, Parkersburg, WV- 284,209 sq. ft. on 
six (6) floors including basement.

·	320 Avery Street Building, Parkersburg, WV- 187,425 sq. ft. on
five (5) floors including basement.

·	Second and Avery Street, Hintgen Building, Parkersburg, WV- 32,855 sq. ft. on one (1) floor. 

·	149 – 19th Street Warehouse, Parkersburg, WV– 36,837 sq. ft. 
on one (1) floor.

·	457 Lost Pavement, CAPS Warehouse, Parkersburg, WV-
 35,000 sq. ft. on one (1) floor.

In addition to the above testing, the following two additional tests shall be completed and results included in the final reports for the appropriate buildings:

1.	Gravimetric analysis test done in the shedder room (19th Street Warehouse) to include 3 particulate samples to assure that the OSHA permissible exposure level of 15 mg/m3 for total pariculate is met.

2.	Acetic acid (or peracetic acid) analysis testing on ground floor (approx. 12,180 square feet) at the 200 Third Street facility in a microfilm processing and storage area, to assure that the OSHA permissible exposure limit of 10 ppm is met.

PURPOSE:

The Bureau of the Public Debt wishes to ensure the in-door air quality is appropriate in facilities occupied by Bureau employees.

The Contractor will provide a summary report and testing for each building to include summaries and testing results for each floor of the 200 Third and 320 Avery Street Buildings. The report shall also contain the appropriate and tested levels of each factor measured, broken down by area/room number and any observations/recommendations to improve air quality. Additionally, the report should provide recommendations regarding the overall operation of the HVAC systems. The final results of the test shall be provided to Public Debt within two weeks of completing the testing.

The testing shall be performed between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The COTR, in advance of work performance, will approve any work performed outside these timeframes. The work will be carried out in such a manner as to cause no interruption with the normal execution of government business.

The Contractor will ensure that employees who perform the work of this contract have the necessary training and experience to effectively perform in-door air quality testing.

SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT:

 Contractor, sub-contractor, and support personnel will be subject to the current security clearance requirements of the Government, as determined by the Government.
The level of clearance required will be determined based on the degree of access, or potential access, to sensitive computerized records and on other risk factors.  
In order to be granted a security clearance, Contractor employees shall pass a security screening which consists of various background checks, including local police and FBI fingerprint checks. 

Information necessary to affect the security screening shall be furnished to the Government on Standard Form 85P.  In most instances, these forms must be furnished in advance of the date work begins or access is required.  Fingerprinting required for screenings or clearances should be provided to the Government at the Government’s expense.  If Contractor employees have undergone recent security screening and been granted clearances to work on Government installations, proof of those screenings or clearances should be provided to the Government and may, at the Government’s discretion, form a basis for granting clearance for work under this contract.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR NEWS CLIPPING SERVICE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to ANSWER QUESTIONS SUBMITTED. QUESTION 1 - Your SOW requires the contractor to, "Post the daily summary on an Internet accessible by NASA personnel across the entire agency."  We interpret this to mean that the contractor should provide the Internet location for posting on our web server, rather than on a NASA server.	Is this interpretation correct?   ANSWER 1 - YES, THE CONTRACTOR PROVIDES A SECURE INTERNET SITE WHERE DAILY CLIPPINGS CAN BE FOUND AND PAST BRIEFINGS SEARCHED. QUESTION 2 - With regard to the inclusion of Washington (DC) schedules in the daily summary, does NASA desire to see all congressional hearings, White House Press Conferences, and other events, or only those dealing with topics relevant to NASA? ANSWER 2 - IT'S GOOD TO SEE A CROSS-SECTION OF DC EVENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND NASA. QUESTION 3 - Does NASA have a preferred format for Past Performance information submitted with this solicitation, and does the Contracting Officer desire verifications from past clients be submitted by the response date? ANSWER 3 - NOTE: I CAN'T ANSWER THIS ONE.  IF THERE'S A PREFERRED FORMAT, I'M NOT AWARE OF ONE. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on DECEMBER 20, 2005.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE OF PARTNERSHIPS

Through this Request for Information (RFI), the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP - hereafter also referred to as “sponsor”) seeks one or more partners (hereafter referred to as “partners”) to assist in developing and delivering seminars, conferences, and trade shows (in conjunction with conference proceedings) or portions thereof – at no cost to the Government sponsor, GSA/OGP.  The ultimate objective of these partnerships is to provide high-quality events (e.g., seminars and conferences) that meet the sponsor’s educational and emerging as well as ongoing policy management needs - as well as enhance the effectiveness of and opportunities for communications between the Federal government and the business communities with which it interacts.  

OGP currently has at least one such partnership, and does not reimburse the  partner for any services rendered or expenses incurred.  In keeping with this scenario, the partners identified through this RFI will not be reimbursed by OGP for any services rendered or expenses incurred in conjunction with this RFI.  It is anticipated that the primary source of funding for the partner services and expenses will be afforded through the fees which each partner collects in conjunction with the events that this RFI covers.

Partner services and expenses may include - but are not limited to - event production and delivery, and related items and activities (e.g., session presenters, lodging, meals, meeting and/or exhibit space, audiovisual support, Internet access, signage, special networking events for participants).  The cost of such services and expenses may be recouped through revenues collected through - but not limited to - attendee registration, industry showcase sponsorships, and collaborative opportunities with other partners.

This no-cost (to the Government sponsor) funding model serves the interests of both parties.  The Government sponsor retains control of the event’s message and content, while the partner retains control of their revenues.  As with all the events and associated activities which this RFI covers – including the extent of the revenues collected – the Government sponsor is ultimately responsible for go/no-go decisions.  The no-cost mechanism specific to each individual event will be mutually agreed upon by the Government sponsor and the partner in writing at the onset of that event’s planning.
