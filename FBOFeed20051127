The Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Pacific/Domestic Dependent Elementary Secondary Schools-Guam (DoDDS-Pacific/DDESS-Guam), Procurement Division, Okinawa, Japan, is seeking information on an automated global positioning vehicle locator system to monitor and track school vehicles throughout South Korea.  The approximate number of vehicles is sixty-five.  The approximate number of base stations that will be tracking the location of the vehicles is seven.   Only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products available to the general public on the open market are desired.  The vehicle locator system must be:  (1) portable (preferable hand held); (2) maintenance free; (3) have a duress alarm that is capable of notifying authorities of an emergency; (4) on demand, provide the near real time location of the vehicle in seconds and be accurate to within 15 meters; (5) user friendly that would require a one-time training session in order to operate; and (6) software that is user friendly and in English.  Possible additional features would consist of voice communications between base stations, authorities, and vehicle operator, and proximity technology (capability to scan, track, and report proximity cards (base passes) imbedded with alphanumeric numbers).  All interested vendors are invited to submit their products along with the vendor’s knowledge and experience working with global positioning systems to include experience in South Korea.  Vendors shall include telecommunication requirements of their systems/products.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIALLY QUALIFIED SOURCES.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  AFTER REVIEW OF THE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS, AND IF THE GOVERNMENT STILL PLANS TO PROCEED WITH THE ACQUISITION, A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WEBSITE.    Interested vendors should submit responses to DPPD@pac.DODEA.edu.  Responses must be received no later than close of business on 22 December 2005.
