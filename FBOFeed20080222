<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to modify, on a sole source basis, Contract HQ0006-01-C-0001 with The Boeing Company, to include concept development for a follow-on exo-atmospheric kill vehicle (EKV), the Complementary Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (CEKV). The CEKV is a multi-phased acquisition supporting both the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) and Sea-Based Midcourse Defense (SMD) programs. The CEKV will use the latest technology to provide improved Counter-Counter measure performance that: exploits all available information; incorporates new Active and Passive sensors technologies; introduces new fusion and discrimination algorithms; and balances load between on-board and off-board sensors and processors.  The effort necessary to satisfy the CEKV concept development is highly specialized and tightly interwoven with the on-going GMD system development efforts being provided by Boeing.  No other source can meet this requirement to provide the planned CEKV concept development effort without the intimate knowledge of, and subsequent ability to integrate the CEKV into the GMD system under this contract.  See note 22.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP toner cartridges.  The use of a brand name description is essential to INR's requirements, for all INR networks and printing capabilities , thereby precluding consideration fo the products of another company.  INR/EX/IS has identified the HP toner cartridges as a key component of INR's printing capabilities. Equipment listed in the PR is required to provide printing from the network printers on the existing INR systems.  The HP toner cartridges are the only toner cartridges taht reporduce the colors correctly and will not damage the printers. The 41 USC 253 (c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet INR's printing requirements as a key component of INR's systems.<BR><BR>

 Description/Specification/Work Statement

 	Background and Need:

Reducing occupational exposure to lead represents a singular opportunity for the construction safety and health community to demonstrate a health impact.  It is one of only a few health hazards with an existing comprehensive OSHA standard for construction.  Lead in construction is also subject to existing and new EPA requirements, and the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program provides a means to evaluate intervention effectiveness that is lacking for other less well known hazards. This pilot project aims to develop or build upon an existing intervention to reduce the high risk of lead exposure for construction workers involved in renovation, remediation, repainting, or demolition of residential or steel structures where lead based paint is present. The intervention should be designed or adapted to be a model which can be feasibly used by parties (e.g., companies, unions, state programs) in other locations to reduce lead exposures among construction workers. The intervention may be developed at the company, local, regional or state level. The project will award a contract to a qualified state program or other entity to design, implement and evaluate the model intervention. Background data from the ABLES Program from 2003-2004 show that painting and paperhanging (NAICS 238320) is the industry with the second greatest number of workers with peak BLLs of 25 ?g/dL or greater and that lead paint removal (NAICS 562910, remediation services) is the industry with the eighth greatest number of workers. In addition to the high prevalence of lead exposures, the painting, renovation and remediation industries are dominated by small businesses, with the average contractor employing approximately five workers.  Lack of resources and awareness for safety and health issues is a common issue for small businesses. Therefore, there is a need in these industries for lead exposure prevention strategies which are affordable, widely publicized and accessible, and easy to implement.


  	Project Objective:  

The overall objective of this pilot project is to reduce occupational lead exposures during renovation, remediation, repainting, and/or demolition activities where lead exposure exists by implementing an affordable and feasible intervention model.   Ideally, progress towards the pilot project?s overall objective will be measured by the decline in the rate of BLLs of 25 mcg/dL or greater among the targeted workers and substantial reductions in air lead exposures.  However, it is possible that one measure, a combination of measures, or other indicators, which may or may not require field sampling, can be used to demonstrate intervention effectiveness.  The specific aims are to:

1)	Develop and implement a lead exposure prevention strategy for use during renovation, remediation, repainting, and/or demolition activities where lead exposure exists which can serve as a model for occupational health and safety programs nationally.  Preferences will be given to interventions with innovative approaches, application of existing knowledge to new approaches and/or application to small businesses.
2)	Evaluate the effectiveness of the prevention strategy, particularly with high-risk lead exposed occupations and jobs.
3)	Develop information products that are targeted and relevant to the construction industry which provide information on the resources required, potential problems, and details a procedure for implementing the model prevention strategy for other establishments and/or organizations.


 	Scope of Work:   

Independently, and not as an agent of the government, the Contractor will furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, equipment and travel required to provide technical and logistical support to develop a model intervention to reduce the high risk of lead exposure for construction workers involved in renovation, remediation, repainting, or demolition of residential or steel structures where lead based paint is present, including the specific tasks below.


   Technical Requirements: 

The Contractor will perform the following tasks. We are estimating 2 phases to this project.  Phase 1 will consist of the initial start-up of the project, including, protocol development, field preparation, and the beginning of the field intervention.  Phase 1 will be completed 12 months from the award of the contract.  Phase 2 will consist of the completion of the field intervention and data collection, data analyses, evaluation of intervention effectiveness, and final reports.  Phase 2 will be completed 24 months from the award of the contract.  Monthly progress reports will be required during both phases.

TASKS 1-6

Phase 1  

Task 1  Protocol: 

The Contractor will provide to the Technical Monitor draft and final protocols describing in detail: (1) the methods of the intervention, including the proposed activities, data collection methods, and anticipated analyses,  (2) the target population of the intervention, and (3) the schedule of the intervention activities, including the number and type of intervention activities anticipated.  The protocol should clearly state the goals of the intervention and the anticipated outcomes of the intervention.  The Technical Monitor will review the draft protocol and provide comments and recommendations within 30 calendar days after receipt of the draft protocol.  The Contractor shall incorporate the Technical Monitor?s comments and submit the final protocol within 45 calendar days after receipt of the comments.

The contractor shall submit and obtain an approval of its institution?s internal review board, if needed, based upon proposed human subjects activities.  The Technical Monitor will determine whether an additional review by NIOSH?s internal review board would be necessary.

	Task 2 Field preparation:

The Contractor shall identify field sites and contact facility owners or management representative(s) to secure cooperation for conduct of the study at the required number of locations.  A written agreement from the representatives of the field sites shall be provided to NIOSH.  The field intervention may consist of field training, and/or changes in engineering controls, equipment substitution, paint removal method, or other methods determined by the Contractor.  The field sites for conducting the intervention may consist of a large jobsite, a collection of jobsites in a geographical area, or a single union.

Task 3  Conduct and complete field intervention:
      
Conduct the field intervention as determined by  the Contractor, with the concurrence of the Project Officer/Technical Monitor to reduce occupational lead exposures during lead renovation, remediation, repainting, and/or demolition activities by implementing an affordable and feasible intervention model.   Ideally, progress towards the pilot project?s overall objective may be measured by the decline in the rate of BLLs of 25 mcg/dL along with substantial reductions in air lead exposures.  However, it is possible that one measure, a combination of measures, or other indicators, which may or may not require field sampling, can be used to demonstrate intervention effectiveness.  

NIOSH expects the field intervention to be local to the contractor. The Contractor will provide for all necessary logistical support for all participants for field investigations.  

Phase 2

Task 4  Data analyses and evaluation of intervention effectiveness:

The Contractor will perform a quantitative evaluation of the intervention?s effectiveness in consultation with the Technical Monitor.  The data collected by the Contractor concerning the intervention and the intervention?s effectiveness will be submitted to NIOSH and will become the property of the government. The authors of publications deriving from this project may include the Technical Monitor as well as Contractors depending on who fulfills the requirements for authorship of scientific publications.

The Contractor shall be responsible for all data entry, cleaning, and data quality control following completion of work at each field site.  All data collected shall be made available as a computer readable file in SAS format or other acceptable electronic format as determined by the Technical Monitor.

Task 5  Final reports: 

The Contractor will provide a draft and final report: (1) describing the intervention in detail including, if applicable, information regarding technical specifications of controls used, rates and frequency of applications, and communication/training techniques, (2) evaluating the effects of the intervention in quantitative measures and, (3) details a procedure for other establishments and/or organizations in the construction industry to implement the intervention methodology, including information on the resources required, technical specifications of applicable controls or methods used (determined in consultation with the Technical Monitor), and potential problems and limitations that may occur to the Technical Monitor in accordance with Section F.  The Technical Monitor will review the draft report and provide comments and recommendations within 30 calendar days after receipt of the draft report.  The Contractor shall incorporate the Government?s comments and submit the final report no later than 365 calendar days after Phase 2 (Year 2) begins.
  

  Reporting Schedule:

The Contractor shall provide the following reports in accordance with the delivery schedule.   


1.	Progress Reports 

The Contractor shall provide brief written monthly progress reports describing progress completed by the contractor, barriers/issues to be resolved, and any key changes in staff or protocol during the reporting period.  

2.	Intervention Protocol

	The Contractor shall provide, first a draft protocol and then a, final protocol which describes in detail: (1) the methods of the intervention, including the proposed activities, data collection methods, and anticipated analyses,  (2) the target population of the intervention, and (3) the schedule of the intervention activities, including the number and type of intervention activities anticipated.  The protocol should clearly state the goals of the intervention and the anticipated outcomes of the intervention.

3.  Agreement from Field Site Representatives

The Contractor shall provide a written agreement from representatives of the field sites granting permission to the Contractor to conduct an intervention study at their site(s).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-07-C-0030 to Advanced Acoustic Concepts, Inc. (AAC).   Under contract N61331-07-C-0030, AAC is developing an Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) contact recognition training system using the same technology developed for the SNIUTT project.  This effort builds directly on technologies, algorithms, and software developed by AAC in developing highly sophisticated embedded anti-submarine warfare sonar training systems under the Surface Navy Integrated Undersea Tactical Technology (SNIUTT) project. AAC was the originator of and developed the initial concept of SNIUTT. This modification provides for continued development of additional AN/AQS-20A sonar skills training that will include updating nine graded lessons for Organic Post Mission Analysis and improved refresher/scenario training based on the SNIUTT technologies. As the originator of the SNIUTT concept and the d!  eveloper of the initial trainers under the project, AAC is the only source with the prerequisite experience, knowledge, and expertise required to successfully perform this requirement.  Unrecoverable duplicative costs and unacceptable schedule delays would result if award were made to any source other than AAC.

<DESC>The Specialty Center Acquisitions NAVFC intends to negotiate a bridge contract, on a sole source basis, to the incumbent contractor, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), CA, under the authority of U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Computer Sciences Corporation will continue to provide Integrated Logistics support (ILS) that includes but is not limited to acquisition of Commercial Off-The-Shelf Technical Manuals, development of Allowance Parts Lists, development of Allowance Equipage Lists, development of Technical Documents such as User Logistics Support Plans, technical Support on-site at NFELC; and  providing logistics assistance and review of ILS documentation as part of the overall logistics support package for equipment procured for NECC units deployed in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), including the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles, and required for policy and process development as part of the Navy Expedit!  ionary Combat Enterprise (NECE) Cross-Functional-Team (CFT 3) working groups. Absence of proper ILS support for deployed equipment makes proper use, maintenance and repairs of CESE significantly more difficult and time-consuming, and may contribute to the loss of the CESE well short of its useful life.  As a result, any delay in providing this ILS support can delay the deployment of this vital equipment to Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) and the Naval Construction Force (NCF/Seabees) field units in combat areas. To remove barriers from competition in the future, we anticipate soliciting ILS support services on a competitive basis; and we anticipate making the award of a competitive follow-on contract no later than nine months from the award of this bridge contract, 1 March 2008. Consequently the bridge contract will be a Not to Exceed (NTE) nine (9) month, Time and Materials contract in the estimated ceiling amount of $5,000,000. This contract is intended to bridge!   the period between the end of the existing contract which expires on  28 February 2008 and a new competitive award to be in place within nine (9) months or sooner. This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations. No solicitation document exists. No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Div. Newport intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Rotating Precision Mechanisms, Northridge, CA for the refurbishment and life cycle support of the PG-10512 and PG-1053 rotators, in particular, refurbishment of the azimuth section and then life cycle support of the rotators. The above mentioned rotators will be supplied as GFE. On-site support will involve travel to various Shipboard Electronic Systems Evaluation Facility (SESEF) locations. This procurement will result in a one-year contact with four one-year options. The basis for the sole source is that RPM is the OEM of the current rotators and the necessary drawings and data are proprietary to that firm.  

The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract maximum order amount on the Acquisition, Logistics, Management and Business Operations Support (ALMBOS) contract supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Awarded in December 2001, this is a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Award Term contract with an anticipated period of performance through April 2010 for acquiring intellectual capital support in the areas of system acquisition and development. This contract also provides for a wide array of critical support such as Senior Military Planners, Plans Analysts, Intel Managers, Sr Psychological Operations Process Analysts, and Technology Experts supporting USSOCOM headquarters, components, Theater Special Operations Commands and the Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps) that provide direct support to Special Operations Forces.  To continue ALMBOS critical support, it is necessary to increase the maximum order amount of one of the multiple-award contracts from $300M to $400M.  This action is due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to the expansion of USSOCOM?s operational tempo as it prosecutes the Global War On Terror.  One or more competitive procurements are anticipated as future follow-ons to the contract. The contractor is Jacob?s Technology Incorporated; contract USZA22-02-D-0014. See Note Number 22

<ARCHDATE>04022008
<CONTACT>Curtis Parker Contract Specialist 303-398-5986
<DESC>The VA Health Administration Center (HAC) is seeking information from potential sources capable of meeting the following requirements:   1.  Title of Project:  Chief Business Office (CBO) - Payer Relations Program Management Office (PMO).   2.  Description of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables.  VA has limited personnel with the expertise and background in public and private health care insurance programs and financing, particularly with respect to managed care operations, to perform the work on the scale needed to positively influence the Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) collections.  The Contractor shall provide experienced staff to support establishing an effective payer relations program to complement the execution and implementation of payer agreements.  The contractor will develop strategies for use in establishing and maintaining payer relationships, develop the tools and training materials for use by field staff and provide mentoring and guidance to additional staff as they are brought on board.  Chief Business Office (CBO) National Payer Relations Office (NPRO) embarked on an ambitious project to develop regional and national agreements with Third Party Payers (TPPs).  The agreements were intended to require the TPPs to pay VA as they would pay hospitals in the private sector.  For the most part, these agreements were a new way of doing business for the VA and for the local medical centers and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISNs).  The development of the agreements proved successful and over 70 regional and national agreements developed by the CBO are now in place.  While an agreement identified what would be paid to the VA, the billing and payment processes to be followed by the VA and the TPP were not always as clear.  As several of the agreements have been in place now for more than a year, it has become apparent that the "how" with respect to working with TPPs to ensure that both sides adhere to the agreement, that billing and payment protocols are followed, and that proper communication exists between the VA and the TPP to ensure a successful relationship is lacking in the payer agreement process.  Establishing a PMO within the CBO NPRO, with support in the field, would provide the foundation to begin developing guidance, training and strategies to develop the relationships with the TPPs to ensure that the agreements are operationalized to their fullest capacity and revenue is maximized based on the agreement.  3. Description of Tasks and Associated Deliverables:  The contractor shall provide the specific deliverables described below.  Task 1:  The contractor shall provide a detailed project management plan and briefing for the VHA project team, which presents the contractor's plan for completing the work.  The contractor's plan shall be responsive to the SOW and describe, in further detail, the approach to be used for each aspect of the work.  At a minimum, the project management plan shall include the risk, quality and technical management approach, detailed schedule, cost requirements, and proposed personnel.  The contractor shall keep the project management plan up to date throughout the period of performance.  Deliverable 1  A detailed project management plan and briefing.  Task 2:  The Contractor shall provide experienced  staff to provide support with respect to establishing an effective payer relations program to complement the execution and implementation of payer agreements.    The Contractor shall:  Participate in and manage project team meetings and discussions and use their technical expertise to assist CBO in the identifying and resolving the business process changes.  Support and facilitate Payer Relations implementation strategy meetings with project representatives to identify implementation needs.  Deliverable 2	The Contractor shall prepare and maintain an Issues and Resolution List describing the technical and business process challenges of the payer relations project.  Task 3.  Make contact with each regional TPP and document pertinent notification and claim processing requirements.  Develop material such as checklists, tools, and/or templates of responsibilities that must be completed/conducted by VA staff/services to in order to comply with the utilization review, billing and payment processing protocols for each payer.  Deliverable 3.1  The Contractor shall provide a summary report document of  benefits and associated reimbursement rates; utilization review, billing and payment protocols, and other payer specific requirements/conditions for the top ten regional TPPs .  Deliverable 3.2  The Contractor shall develop a standardized reference template to record the summary information and instruct facility/VISN employees how to complete the same information for other regional TPPs. Deliverable 3.3 The Contractor shall develop materials/tools that outline facility and VISN responsibilities to implement and maintain payer agreement protocols of each of the regional TPP.  Task 4.  The Contractor shall develop and implement an education plan to train VA PMO staff in negotiation strategies and tactics for developing and maintaining TPP relationships.  Deliverable 4.  The Contractor shall develop and implement an education plan with the following components: evaluating the operational components of reimbursement contracts, establishing effective relationships with payers, validating contractual payments for accuracy, negotiation skills and techniques, roles and responsibilities of facility and VISN staff for the payer relations program and strategies for dealing with non-compliant payers.  Task 5.  The Contractor shall develop strategies for addressing TPPs that are not in compliance.  Deliverable 5.  The Contractor shall develop a written plan documenting strategies for addressing TPPs that are not in compliance. These strategies shall include standard operating procedures for addressing non-compliance.  4.  Place of Performance:  The Contractor shall support this effort at the Department of Veterans Affairs, 1722 I Street, NW Washington, DC 20006, or at approved Contractor facilities as directed by the COTR and mutually agreed upon.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>59--Juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers.

<RESPDATE>053008
<ARCHDATE>07292008
<CONTACT>Raymond Greenheck, (503)808-4616
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers for evaluating  behavior and survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Power System (FCRPS).   Receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  S elf-contained autonomous receivers that detect, decode, and store decoded messages are typically deployed in areas within the Columbia River basin where a power source is not readily available and cable runs not feasible for a variety of reasons.  Cabled r eceivers detect, decode, and store decoded messages, time of arrival, and message waveforms as received on up to four hydrophones at large hydro-electric dams within the FCRPS.  Numbers of clusters form arrays that are time synchronized using time obtained  from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers.  Cabled receivers are used for estimating route and time of passage including 2D and 3D position estimates for tagged fish.  Portable receivers detect, decode, store, and display transmitted signals for in l aboratory transmitter testing and for displaying and entering transmitter codes at the time of tagging.  A mobile receiver consisting of a single 4 hydrophone cluster deployed from a single boat has been used to provide 2D and 3D position estimates on acti vely migrating tagged fish.   In 2008, the USACE intends to award a multi-year (1 year with 4 option years) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the manufacturing of the above receiver types.  In addition to manufacturing this c ontract will include line items for the repair and refurbishment of existing and future JSATS receivers; development of a graphical user interface for communication, retrieval of detection data, receiver diagnostic and acceptance testing checks for each re ceiver type.  All functional specifications for the JSATS are government owned and will be provided in the solicitation package.  Where applicable, the design specifications and drawings for existing JSATS receivers will be provided.  Hydrophone assemblies  designed specifically for JSATS receivers will be provided by the government.  This procurement action shall be conducted in two phases, an evaluation phase and a production phase.  In order to be eligible for award, and as part of the evaluation criteria , the offeror must demonstrate that their JSATS receiver meets the functional and design specifications provided in the solicitation.  The USACE will use lowest price, technically acceptable protocols for selection of up to 3 qualified firms.  These firms will be awarded contracts to enter into the evaluation phase (Phase I) of this action.  The evaluation phase shall consist of the preparation of a fully functional prototype receiver(s) that will be evaluated for performance by a USACE contractor.  Followi ng acceptance testing of prototype receivers the USACE will use Tradeoff/Best Value protocols to select a single company to enter into the production phase (Phase II) of the contract.  Evaluation and rating factors will be included in the solicitation when  issued.  The solicitation (RFQ) outlining receiver specifications is expected to be posted on or about 11 April 2008 and the tentative quote due date is 30 May 2008.  The administrative/contracting point of contract is Ray Greenheck at (503) 808-4616.

<DESC>The due date for receipt of proposals for Solicitation No. 08SP603800 has been changed.  The proposals are now due by the close of business on March 18, 2008. The attached document contains the Past Performance Questionnaire that is required to be submitted with the proposal.   ****************************************************************************************************************************************** Original Announcement The Bureau of Reclamation announces its intention to negotiate Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the procurement of professional surveying services consisting of leveling, construction, geodetic, boundary, topographic, route, hydrographic, control, and cadastral surveys, Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) land base grid creation and analysis,  and the use of GPS and laser scanner technologies for projects within the Great Plains Region.  These services are to be provided on a firm, fixed-price task order basis in the states of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  The contracts will be negotiated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 36, as implemented by Departmental and Agency regulations and directives. The performance period will be for one year beginning on the date of contract award, with four pre-priced optional years.  The options may be exercised solely at the discretion of the Government without further competition.  The cumulative orders over the life of the contract may not exceed $1,000,000.  Principal items of professional surveying services are as follows: 1.	Perform services under individual fixed-price task orders in any of the above referenced disciplines in any of the specified states.   2.	There will be a maximum of two contracts awarded as a result of these negotiations.  3.	The maximum order limitation for any task order placed under this contract will be $100,000, with cumulative orders over the life of the contract(s) not to exceed $1,000,000.   4.	The minimum order guarantee per contract, per year will be $3,000.   Competent firms suitably staffed to perform the required services are invited to submit four copies of a current Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications.  In addition to the Standard Form 330, interested companies shall submit a minimum of three (3) Past Performance Questionnaires from previous federal projects.  The SF-330 and Past Performance Questionnaires must be received in this office no later than 2:00 PM on February 26, 2008.   The proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:   1.	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Include your firm's Registered Professional Surveyors' experience in similar surveys for the states in which the work is to be performed.  2.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required.  List years of experience in similar surveys for the key personnel that will be involved on projects if awarded the contract.  3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Identify your firm's equipment, personnel availability, and management and quality control procedures used to ensure reasonable deadlines are met and quality deliverables are produced.  4.	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. The Government intends to award up to two contracts to provide professional surveying services to meet the survey requirements of the entire Great Plains Region.  Therefore, each firm needs to be able to provide professional surveying services for all nine states within the Great Plains Region.  If one firm is not able to provide these services and technologies for the entire region, they would need to subcontract with other firms so that they are able to meet the surveying requirements of the entire region.  Accordingly, any proposed subcontractor(s) and their SF-330's shall be included in the proposal at the time they are due.   Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, the Government will initiate negotiations with the highest-rated firms.  If the Government and the firms are able to reach agreement on fair and reasonable pricing, a contract award will be made.  If not, then the Government will terminate negotiations and then initiate negotiations with the next highest rated firm.  Award of the IDIQ contract for professional surveying does not in and of itself guarantee the contractor(s) all survey work within the Great Plains Region.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right and authority to procure survey work through full and competition in response to the specific business needs as determined by the Great Plain's Chief of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Fabricate and deliver 6 weathered steel kiosks. 

Modifacation to change ship to address:  
Black Hills National Forest
1019 N. 5th
Custer, SD  57730


and

Requests for Clarification :
 1. Please define ?WTO GPA? as found in 52.212-3, (f) Buy American Act Certificate, (4) (iii) 
also, this par [ (iii) ] appears to allow for a waiver of Buy American Act  restrictions.  Is this a correct understanding?
 Did you add FAR 52.225-1 in the solicitation? What is your intent? 
FYI  All items required to construct these units are commonly available "Made in USA"  

2. Is the design provided in the Sol. a USFS design, or has the FS incorporated a known manufacturer?s design into the Solicitation? Has the Forest Service procured any of these Kiosks since the design was produced?  Do you have  catalogue information on this design from a known manufacturer?  Does the FS view this Sol as a sole source Procurement? 
The quick answer, No.   The "Design" as shown on the drawings represents the government's general and/or minimum requirements. Specific designs or features beyond the few specified requirements(such as the triangular shape and general size of the kiosk, the display panel support columns, or required dimensions) are the responsibility of the manufacturer.

3. Are funds available for this Solicitation? Is this Procurement now funded? Yes

4. The  Sol documents in several areas address design or specified  components as  ?Minimum?; does this terminology allow for the Mfg/supplier/offeror to effect substitutions of higher quality and serviceability?
Minimum Dimensions: The finished component shall have a dimension no less then that indicated on the drawings.
Minimum Standard Specification: All materials supplied must meet the referenced standards and/or specifications. Suppliers are free to provide materials which exceed however, the material must be certified to meet the referenced standard or specification.

5. Are Quotations required to be delivered to the  Black Hills National Forest, 1019 N. 5th Ave., Custer, SD 57730, or to Rocky Mtn Region at the Denver Fed Center Simms street address?   
 Black Hills National Forest

6. Is electronic transfer of the Offeror?s Quotation acceptable?  Or, does  the FS Facility at Black Hills National Forest, 1019 N. 5th Ave., Custer, SD 57730  customarily  receive Next Day FedX service by 10:30 AM?
   I have no problem accepting an electronic quote but the drawings may be proprietary.

7. Can you provide a catalogue Cut for the DISPLAY PANELS, or in the alternative a provide an acceptable Manufacturer or Supplier of the Panel itself? 
The display panels will be purchased under a separate contract which has not yet been awarded. Flat, unframed Digital High Pressure Laminate panels are a common item and information is available from numerous sources. The panels purchased for the kiosks will be compatible with the rear mounting layout as shown on the drawings. The government encourages proposals with innovative mounting systems included.

8. Under EVALUATION OF QUOTES the second paragraph states that ?Quotations should include drawings .....[et al] ...?  Is the intent of this to have Offerors supply actual Drawings [et al] which are clearly proprietary, as a part of the Quotation, or is the intent to have Offerors cover the costs for such materials and efforts in their Quotation?
Offers should include drawings, photographs, and/or illustrations which clearly show the general appearance of the finished kiosk and that the various requirements, as shown on the drawings, are met by their proposal. The offer should include sufficient information to most advantageously represent the proposed item(s). The government is not obligated to request further information if it is unclear whether the proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation.  


Column loading data is required only after award of the contract.

Roof panels colored both sides, though not common, are available. These are nor a requirement for biding but are desired by the government and inclusion in a offer will enhance the evaluation.
Uncoated roof panels are not acceptable due to the "rust ring" created on the concrete pad.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification 8 is to post questions and answers. The deadline for responding to this Solicitation and for submitting sample rifles remains as February 29, 2008. 

Question: How long does USSS plan on keeping the weapons during first part of the evaluation?
Answer: USSS anticipates six weeks to be adequate for PHASE I test verification.

Question: Re the clarification: On or before 5 PM EST Monday, February 25, each vendor submitting sample rifles shall send an email message containing the tracking number of that shipment and vendor name for a point of contact. So we generate a tracking number on Monday the 25th and ship the rifles on the 29th?
Answer: USSS requires the tracking number on Monday, February 25 but the rifles need not be shipped until Friday, February 29. 

Question: Can we hand deliver the weapons instead of shipping them (with coordination)? 
Answer: No, per USSS security policy, packages may not be hand delivered.

Question: A tracking number is needed on Monday for your office, however, we will not have a tracking number if the rifles are to be shipped on Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.... Can we send an email on Monday stating we are sending (or delivering) rifles on a given date within the due dates then follow up with a tracking number once shipped? 
Answer: USSS' understanding is that a tracking number may be generated before a shipment is picked up from a vendor location. If it is not possible to generate a tracking number, then a vendor submitting sample rifles shall send an email message containing the ship date of that shipment, shipping method and vendor name for a point of contact

Question: Are the rifles due at your location (USSS) on Feb 29 or must they be shipped from our location with the last day being Feb 29 for shipping?
Answer: Ship rifles on or before 5 PM Friday, February 29. A late shipment of the rifles would be after Friday.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air Programs (OAP), Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) anticipates awarding a single Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity, Time-and-Materials contract with a one-year base and four one-year option periods. This procurement will be conducted as a full-and-open competition under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15: Contracting by Negotiation. The formal solicitation and other related information and items will be posted at this website on or about March 10, 2008. The total labor hours estimated for this effort is approximately 678,000 hours for the base and all options. The minimum amount of labor hours for each year is approximately 4,700. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal. Copies of the solicitation will be available on this site. Paper copies of the solicitation will not be provided. An RFI /Sources sought was previously posted PR-HQ-08-10055, on EPA's website and FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested parties to regularly monitor EPA's website for updates to this procurement. Telephone inquiries will not be taken.  The objective of this requirement is support of the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET). CASTNET is a long-term environmental monitoring network that measures changes in ambient air quality and assesses atmospheric deposition over broad geographic regions of the U.S.  Operating since 1987, CASTNET has evolved into a robust regional monitoring program which currently consists of 84 monitoring stations nationwide.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) operates a majority of the CASTNET monitoring stations.  In cooperation with the EPA, the National Park Service (NPS) currently operates 25 stations.  The primary monitoring objectives of CASTNET are to: Provide atmospheric data on atmospheric deposition, rural ground level ozone and other forms of atmospheric pollution; Monitor the status and trends in regional air quality and atmospheric deposition; Assess and report on geographic patterns and long-term, temporal trends in ambient air pollution and atmospheric deposition; Improve our understanding of PM and ozone formation; Validate and improve atmospheric models; Provide data for health-based research and epidemiology studies; Assess the effectiveness of EPA?s emission reduction programs and Support science and ecosystem studies. CASTNET, a long-term regional monitoring program, is critical for characterizing trends in deposition levels and identifying relationships among emissions, atmospheric loadings, ecological effects and human health.  The EPA under several different mandates as well as other government agencies and the scientific community rely on the data and information from CASTNET, used in conjunction with information from other national monitoring networks (e.g., the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) and Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE)), to evaluate the effectiveness of air pollution control strategies for regional areas and assess chemical changes in the atmosphere.   CASTNET tracks real-world environmental results over time and space as emission reductions take place.  Since atmospheric changes occur very slowly and trends are often obscured by the wide variability of measurements and climate, numerous years of continuous and consistent data are required to overcome this variability. Please review the draft Statement of Work available on the EPA website (www.epa.gov/oam) for more information regarding this requirement. The formal solicitation, amendments, procurement updates and other related information will be posted on this website as they become available.   Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the EPA website for updates concerning this procurement. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Telephone requests or inquires will not be taken.

<DESC>Modification 03.

Modification 03 is issued to provide additional clarification through questions and answers.

QUESTION 6. Is there any document size limitation for this submission?

ANSWER 6. No size limitations for responses have been specified.


QUESTION 7. What is the expected size of the envisioned the COMSATCOM contract.  What portio do you anticipate will be a small business set-aside?

ANSWER 7. At this point many options are being considered, and this information is not available at this time.


QUESTION 8. In reviewing your document there is no specific mention of any particular ground segment modem.  What do you see the role of the JIPM modem as being in the context of the envisioned COMSATCOM contract?

ANSWER 8. There is not one standard ground segment modem employed within DoD today.  JIPM is open standards based and capable of operation on commercial satellites.  It is likely that JIPM's role will increase with time, however, a number of other commercial modems are expected to remain in use.


QUESTION 9. When do you expect the COMSATCOM contract to commence? Specifically, in light of DISA currently examining its Commercial SATCOM provisioning process and improving it through the application of 6 sigma, is it likely that the COMSATCOM contract will be issued before the current DSTSG contract expires? How do the DISN-DGS and DISN-DTS-P recompete figure in it?

ANSWER 9. At this point many options are being considered, and this information is not available at this time.


QUESTION 10. Is this RFI meant to address Bandwidth Only or Bandwidth and Hardware?  If Bandwidth and Hardware, what percentage of the overall value of the resulting Contract does DISA expect each category to represent?

ANSWER 10. The RFI is meant to address bandwidth as well as associated services and hardware.  It is premature to provide any guidance with respect to the projected mix of business.
 

QUESTION 11. Paragraph 3.1.2.7: When addressing SLA's with respect to Situational Awareness, is this referring to entire end-to-end metrics, network metrics, satellite metrics, transponder metrics, or some other metric? 

ANSWER 11. DISA is trying to better understand what types of SLA's are typically employed in the commercial marketplace; this includes any and all types of service-related metrics.

QUESTION 12. Can Federal Express deliver packages to both addresses?  (Please note, this is not an issue for DITCO.)  They usually ask for a street address (vice a mailing address) and sometimes have difficulty entering DOD facilities.  In the same vein, is it possible for one of our team to drop off the backup copy at DISA in the Washington area?   

ANSWER 12. Both addresses are capable of receiving FedEx deliveries.  The preferred method of delivery is prescribed in the RFI.  It may be difficult to access the DISA D.C. or Scott AFB IL facilities due to security issues.  Additionally, the Government team members cannot guarantee to be available to collect the CDs directly from respondents when delivered.

All else remains the same.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the natural gas distribution (NAICS 221210) and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Little Rock Air Force Base (AFB), Arkansas. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.     The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the natural gas and wastewater utility systems at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.     Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.     Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.     Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.     Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm EST on Thursday, March 13, 2008.   Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:     (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).     The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.     As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.   Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.     

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

<DESC>Submission of Capability Statements<BR><BR>This is a follow-on sources sought announcement to the one published on 12 December 2008.  The U.S. Army Environmental Command (USAEC) and the Fort Bragg Directorate of Contracting (FBDOC), Army Contracting Agency-Southern Region will continue to accept capability statements from small businesses in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541620 ($6.5M size standard) through 3 April 2008 (see the FebBizOps Sources Sought dated 18 Dec ember 2008).  Small businesses interested in supporting one of the 4 environmental enterprise areas of Environmental Compliance, Cultural Resources, Natural Resources, and Management/Professional Services can find information on this requirement and the in formation brief at the Industry Conference held on 30-31 January 2008 at http://aec.army.mil/usaec/business/index.html.  This web site will continue to be used to release future draft documents for comment to industry.  The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish separate multiple award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract suites (all set-aside for small business) consisting of a basic ordering period of one (1) year and four 1-year optional ordering periods for each enterprise a rea.  Task orders will be competed strictly within the context of each enterprise area multiple award ID/IQ contract.  The estimated program ceiling (over 5 years) for each enterprise area is as follows:  Environmental Compliance - $230M, Cultural Resource s - $45M, Natural Resources - $105M, and Management/Professional Services - $190M.  The estimated program ceiling reflects the total value of all actions to be conducted under that multiple award enterprise ID/IQ contract suite.  The conceptual acquisition  strategy includes an Organizational Conflict of Interest restriction on the Management/Professional Services enterprise contract.  This means that contractors that compete on that enterprise area will be precluded competing as prime contractors in the oth er areas and vice versa.  <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.  The Government will not award a contract based on the submission of capability statements.  This is an opportunity for small businesses interested in serving as prime  contractors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they could meet the requirements specified in each of the enterprise areas.  The Government will review the capability statements and inform submitters on whether they are considered to be viable competitors for this acquisition.  Submitters in the identified NAICS code that are deemed viable will be identified to industry on the web site listed above unless they inform the Government of a desire to opt out.  The capability statements are  also being used to support and finalize the acquisition strategy.  <BR><BR>Capability statements shall be limited to no more than eight (8) pages and must be submitted for each separate enterprise area. No more than two (2) pages should be used to address  the Contracting Topics and no more than six (6) pages for each Draft PWS and Requirements Related topics.   All questions are listed below.

<RESPDATE>032108
<ARCHDATE>02212009
<CONTACT>Deborah Marcus Contract Specialist 7022938514 demarcus@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes only.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for the operation of tour ticket sales and management of parking operations.  At present, Reclamation has two separate contracts to provide these services, however; Reclamation is considering combining the services into a single contract. Reclamation manages all of the engineering, maintenance, and public activities that directly involve Hoover Dam.  Hoover Dam is perhaps the most historically important dam structure within the United States.  It sits across the Colorado River (Nevada/Arizona boundary) and forms Lake Mead.  The dam which was built during the depression and completed in 1935 provides power generation, downstream flood protection, and water for agricultural and human consumption. Over 1,000,000 people per year make a specific effort to visit Hoover Dam either on their way through or as a specific side trip.  Reclamation operates a large visitor center and also provides a multi-story parking structure, both on the Nevada side of the dam.  Reclamation provides exhibits related to the construction of the dam and conducts tours inside the plant and/or dam.  There are retail outlets, run by the State of Nevada under the authority of the Randolph Shepard Act, providing souvenirs, food, and beverages to the public. A new bypass with a bridge across the Colorado River is currently being constructed approximately ý mile below the dam and when it is completed in 2 or 3 years, it will provide for the through traffic and change the current traffic and congestion crossing the dam. Visitor services are conducted everyday, except 2 days, throughout the year, with spring and summer receiving the highest visitation.  Tours conducted in the interior portions of the dam will continue to be conducted by Federal Reclamation staff. In fiscal year 2007, the parking and ticketing activities generated approximately, $8,235,000 in sales. The parking structure serviced approximately 12,500 commercial vehicles and 345,000 privately owned vehicles. There were approximately, 4,660,000 vehicles that crossed over the dam during that time frame.  In addition, approximately 867,000 tourists bought tickets to the Visitor Center either by purchasing Visitor Center Admission Only tickets or one of the Tour Ticket Options.  Ticket Revenue grossed approximately $8,235,000. Overall management and administration would be expected to assure that all operations run efficiently and provide good value and service to the public by one company.  The contractor would be expected to enhance the historic Hoover Dam experience while maintaining the dignity of the area.  The contractor shall perform the work described as follows:  (1)	The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to manage and operate the Hoover Dam Parking Garage, as well as overflow and remote parking lots seven days a week, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas days. The Contractor is expected to provide tickets to visitors using the parking lots while they are being managed. a.	Contractor will accept and account for collected parking fees. b.	Contractor will provide the financial and managerial controls to carry out all of the tasks related to Parking operations. c.	Contractor's Manager and alternate(s) must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English, and possess good customer relation skills. (2)	The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to manage and operate the Ticketing Operation at Hoover Dam, to include on site ticket sales and the booking of reservations seven days a week, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas days.  a.	Contractor will accept and account for collected Visitor Center admission and tour fees.  Contractor must possess a ticketing/financial system which is able to account for and segregate the various types of revenue collected as well as to track upgrades, changes, and refunds for the various types of tickets sold. b.	Contractor will provide the financial and managerial controls to carry out all of the tasks related to Ticketing operations. c.	Contractor's Manager and alternate(s) must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English, and possess good customer relation skills.  d.	The scope of work also includes delivering pre-sold tour tickets to commercial carriers and members of the public, such as school groups; providing information to members of the public; and accepting and remitting other revenues collected by Government officials. Reclamation anticipates awarding a new contract prior to December 1, 2008.  The proposed contract will be firm-fixed price with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The acquisition will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561599 - All Other Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services, with a small business size standard of $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region is seeking responsible sources having the capabilities to perform the work.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capabilities of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted. Capability statements are to be submitted not later than March 21, 2008. The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's experience and capability to perform the principal components of the work listed above.  Packages should include the following information:   (1) Provide business name, address, business size, and type (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.  (2) Demonstrate the firm's experience by providing a list of projects completed where the work involved the operation and maintenance of ticketing and/or parking garage management (or similar assignments) that included selling tickets to the general public, accounting for the funds received, and managing parking structure grounds, such as a garage.

Additionally, for each project listed, provide the following: dollar value of the job, the project name, project location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed.

<DESC>This market survey is being conducted by the General Services Administration (GSA) to seek minority contractors who are interested in submitting a Request for Qualifications for the Repair and Alterations (R&A) of the C. Clifton Young Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, 300 Booth Street, Reno, Nevada,  Design/Build Project.   The project would ideally be set aside for a women-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or 8(a) small businesses.  The number of responses received from interested minority contractors shall determine whether  this requirement  can be set aside.

The C. Clifton Young Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse is a five-story building that was built in 1965.  To date no major alteration of any kind has been undertaken during its service life.  However due to continuous maintenance and selective equipment upgrades, the building is currently in acceptable operating condition.  The anchor tenant in the building is the United States Bankruptcy Court (USBC) and the remaining federal tenant agencies primarily provide support.  

The design-build method of contracting will be utilized for this project.  The selected design-build contractor must be a viable corporate entity having familiarity and knowledge with federal court construction.  The contractors' past performanceand experiences on similar past/present projects must be verifiable.  It is essential that the contractor be able to competently budget, schedule, and provide quality control.  The design-build contractor will be evaluated objectively on a competitive basis, relying on the background and ability of the contractor from the information provided.  A quantitative evaluation process will not be used to select the contractor.

The proposed renovation work includes asbestos abatement; demolition and removal work; new roofing; building accessibility upgrades; fire-safety upgrades; new fire sprinkler system; plumbing upgrades; electrical upgrades; ADA code compliance; air-flow study and HVAC upgrades; site improvement; dedicated water supply installation; building water service improvements; and repair of the building curtain wall.  The primary project goal is to avoid building system failures and improve the overall reliability and operability of the building for approximately the next fifteen years.  No architectural modernization is anticipated.  The building will be occupied and fully operational during construction.  Tenant agencies will move around within the building to accommodate construction.

Interested contractors must submit a Letter of Interest and a Resume displaying their firm's qualifications and past performance on similar projects in order to participate in the Design/Build project.  These must both be sent via e-mail to the Contracting Specialist, Christopher Lee, at christopher.lee@gsa.gov by no later than 4:30 P.M. PST on Wednesday JANUARY 16, 2008.

Each craft contains a port and starboard machinery system.  Each machinery system consists of two (2) gas turbine engines with one single reduction right angle drive gearbox for each engine (total of four (4) gas turbine engines and four (4) single reduction right angle drive gearboxes per craft), as well as shafting sections, flexible couplings, and parallel axis single reduction gear drives that transmit power to the lift and propulsion systems.  Each gas turbine engine delivers 4,000-5,000 SHP @15,400-16,100 RPM.  The right angle drive gearbox must reduce the engine output shaft speed by a factor of 2.76, such that the maximum gearbox output drive shaft speed does not exceed 5,833 RPM.  On each side of the craft, the forward most right angle gearbox must be connected to a manually operated disconnect clutch.  Gearbox designs must be able to handle a maximum continuous torque (from the gas turbine engine) of 1,565 lbs ft.  All gearbox designs must incorporate an overrunnin!  g clutch to allow for continued operation of the lift and propulsion systems in the event of an engine shutdown.  The total wet weight of each right angle gearbox must not exceed 340 lbs.  Potential gearbox designs must not exceed the following dimensional constraints: length (parallel to craft centerline including gearbox drive shaft) = 27 in, width (athwartship) = 20 in, and height = 22 in.  All gearbox designs must be able to operate with MIL-L-23699 (synthetic) oil.  Each gearbox must incorporate a debris monitoring device (chip detector) to detect and electronically transmit wear metal information to the operator.  Gearbox designs must conform to MIL-STD 271F Change Notice 1 (non-destructive inspection) and MIL-STD 167-1A (vibration).  In addition, all gearbox designs must be certified in accordance with ANSI/AGMA 6032-A94 and ANSI/AGMA ISO 1328 (accuracy grade 2 to 3) for high speed marine gears, and the gearboxes must have a designed MTBO of 6,000 hours.

Product Capabilities
Examination Gloves are worn by medical personnel in healthcare settings, where the procedures being conducted may result in an increased exposure to blood or body fluids, with a potential risk of transfer of pathogens. Pathogens can be transferred through contact between patients and medical staff, resulting in bloodborne infections in patients or bloodborne infections in medical personnel. Both patients and the medical personnel need to be protected from this risk, which can be reduced by implementing protective hand barriers, i.e., exam gloves. Gloves must accomplish this and be form-fitting, durable, tear-resistant, and provide adequate tactile sense and dexterity to handle instruments and supplies used in these procedures.
Product Description
If a solicitation is issued quotes will be sought for brand name (Safeskin Nitrile exam gloves) or equal products.  Nitrile examination gloves are constructed of Nitrile polymers that displays rubber-like characteristics, but have no natural rubber or rubber latex components, to reduce the potential of sensitivity to natural rubber latex proteins. Gloves are designed to resist puncturing, tearing and abrasion, and maintain durability during normal use, to provide a dependable barrier from potential contamination.  Gloves must be soft, supple and flexible, while providing a snug, comfortable fit which conforms to the contour of the hand, and allows adequate tactile sense and dexterity to handle instruments and supplies used in medical procedures.  Glove may be textured to enhance wet and dry grip.  Gloves must be non-sterile, ambidextrous, powder-free, single-use and have a beaded cuff.  Gloves may be of an appropriate color to make them readily identifiable, and must be boxed and packaged in a manner to protect them from contamination and allow ease of dispensing.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis.  The purpose of the sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of possible small business qualified sources relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for "Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services" code number 541690.  The small business size standard for 541690 is $6.5M in annual receipts (Annual receipts of a concern means the annual average gross revenue for the last three fiscal years). Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to make appropriate determinations about potential sources and to determine the possibility of small business set-asides.

PROJECT BACKGROUND

Wind energy is the fastest growing source of energy in the United States.  As this important energy source continues to grow, evaluating its impact on the operation of regional electrical systems becomes increasingly important.  Evaluating wind energy?s interaction with the utility grid allows for a better understanding of how to manage the wind resource during planning and actual day to day operations.  Quantifying the actual impact of wind energy on specific regional electrical systems provides information that is also used in transmission planning.

Regional mandates that require public utilities to include renewable energy as a portion of their generation portfolios are being adopted by many states and could be adopted on a national level.  New transmission will be required for much of the future wind power that will be installed in the United States. It is imperative to plan for this transmission because it takes longer to build new transmission than it does to build wind plants. Analysis of future wind power penetration onto the electrical grid scenarios using state of the art production cost models, transmission power flow and power simulation models, and related methodologies is an important step in the wind energy integration and transmission planning process.  

The Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study (EWITS) will coincide with transmission analyses being conducted by several regional reliability councils including the Pennsylvania Jersey Maryland (PJM), Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reliability councils.  MISO is leading an effort to model future transmission scenarios for much of the Eastern United States, and this work will coincide closely with its transmission planning analysis.

As part of this study, NREL will convene a Technical Review Committee (TRC) that will include representatives from regional electric reliability councils, the Utility Wind Integration Group, utilities, and the wind industry, as well as study subcontractors and transmission planners. The TRC will meet quarterly (more often if needed) to review study progress, comment on study inputs and assumptions, help with collecting data (if appropriate) and review the draft report.  In addition, NREL will convene a stakeholder group that will include interested utilities, public utility commissions (PUCs), non-government organizations (NGOs), transmission planning groups, and renewable energy developers/industry. NREL will organize three or four stakeholder meetings?a kick-off meeting, and meetings to review the scenarios and mesoscale data and methodologies, interim results, and the final report. The stakeholder and TRC processes are considered critical to gaining buy-in from relevant parties.

The Eastern Mesoscale Study, a precursor to EWITS, will result in the identification of more than 500 gigawatts (GW) of potential future wind plant sites for the Eastern United States, and its hourly time series data will be used as an input to EWITS. EWITS will focus on the integration of wind power into the eastern wind integration area footprint, as well as transmission planning for the entire Eastern Interconnect, a wide region covering much of the eastern half of the United States.  The EWITS will be similar in scope to the current Western Wind Integration Study.

OBJECTIVE
The goal of EWITS is to help stakeholders, including regional utilities and transmission operators, to understand the costs and operating impacts of significant amounts of wind power on their grids and to help them in future transmission planning.  

SCOPE OF WORK

The work will include seven main tasks.
1. 	Conduct a preliminary analysis to develop scenarios that will examine high levels of wind penetration and answer specific stakeholder issues.
2. 	Model a baseline assessment for the wind integration study area footprint without new wind power. 
3. 	Conduct a detailed transmission planning analysis for the entire Eastern Interconnect for the 20 percent and 30 percent wind energy penetration scenarios. 
4.	 Model two high renewable energy scenarios based on a 20 percent and 30 percent wind energy penetration in the Eastern Interconnect analyzing wind integration within the wind integration study area footprint. 
5.	Model two variations based on the 20 percent and/or 30 percent wind energy penetration scenarios analyzing wind integration within the wind integration study area footprint to answer specific stakeholder issues. 
6.	Conduct an effective load carrying capacity (ELCC) and a loss of load probability (LOLP) analysis on four high penetration wind scenarios within the wind integration study area footprint.
7.	Prepare draft and final reports.

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business (small business types only) pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 541690 and must demonstrate qualifications for the following capabilities:

1.	Demonstrated capability with electric power system operational simulation analysis and software.  Strongly prefer extensive experience with ProMod and ProSim to ensure compatibility with Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) processes and datasets. 
2.	Demonstrated capability in analysis of variable, weather driven resources (wind or solar) and their impacts on electric power grid transmission and generation operations.  Strongly prefer demonstrated capability through publically available and peer reviewed renewable energy grid integration projects in North American or European grid applications. 
3.	Demonstrated capability to perform grid operational analysis with multiple stakeholder and utility involvement. Strongly prefer past experience with an exeternal, public peer review process. 
4.	Strong communications skills, demonstrated by past written and oral presentations, on power systems operational issues for a variety of technical and policy/interest group audiences.  Involvement in wind power forums such as the Utility Wind Integration Group and Trade Group conferences considered a plus. 
5.	Past experience with utility analysis in study footprint of MISO, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), PJM, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system operators preferred. 
6.		Strongly prefer knowledge of wind power variability statistics and data sources.

<DESC>On behalf of the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on small businesses capable of providing contract services for a new initiative entitled: High-throughput Collection of Gene Expression Data in Developing Rhesus Macaque Brain.  Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.

This contract will require high throughput collection of gene expression data, and development of a digital brain atlas and associated informatics tools for the analysis of gene expression in specific regions of developing Rhesus macaque brain. More specifically this contract would utilize high throughput, automated histological processing of samples from the developing Rhesus macaque brain, including sectioning, histological staining, and in situ hybridization, resulting in the generation of high resolution gene expression data related to cytoarchitecture which will be represented in a publicly-available digital brain atlas with associated informatics tools, to facilitate data searches and analyses by other investigators.

Tissues for analysis under this contract will be obtained via a separate contract (to be established), with a facility that has access to well-defined colonies of rhesus macaques, raised in naturalistic settings, where the lineage and hierarchical status of each animal is characterized in detail. This other facility will prepare and transfer the tissues to this contract facility for histological processing and digitization as described above. This contractor will be required to work effectively and closely with the animal facility contractor.

As the lead institute for this Blueprint project, NIMH is seeking to pursue a systematic approach to elucidate gene expression during normal brain development, an identified research area of need with great significance for human health and disease. The recent sequencing of the genome of the Rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, as well as its broad application as a research model, suggest that this nonhuman primate species would provide the optimal translational bridge between existing gene expression atlases in other species, including mouse, and future efforts in human.

NIMH's overall goal for this contract is to develop a publicly available data resource to stimulate research in gene expression during normal brain development. It is anticipated that this resource in general will significantly advance knowledge of gene expression in developing primate brain, and provide a template for future studies in developing human brain. It is also anticipated that there will be some form of continued support of this publicly available digital atlas, database, and associated informatics tools, following contract completion.

To successfully accomplish the goals of this contract, capable small businesses must demonstrate expertise in: 1) neurobiology; 2) both automated and high throughput histological processing, including in situ hybridization; and 3) development of digital atlases of gene expression, associated informatics tools, and web-based dissemination of data.

The contract will require a validated HTP methodology regarding: probe design, sensitivity, variability, reproducibility and quality control. Therefore, the HTP technique/procedure must be: 1) a reliable validation of gene expression at the level of cellular resolution within specific structures across developmental stages; and 2) scalable, such that additional genes could be included for analysis in specific brain regions if so desired.

Any small business that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the above work. Capability Statements should clearly state/describe: 1) the offerors experience and qualifications to perform this work; 2) your business size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (Note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541712, 500 employees); 3) your the management structure, history of your organization (for example number of years in business and DUNS #); and 4) any other resources available to perform this work (e.g. scientific equipment, laboratory facilities, etc.).

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO RECEIPT NOTICE WILL BE SENT TO THE SUBMITTER OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT AND NO EVALUATION WILL BE PROVIDED OF ANY RESPECTIVE CAPABILITY STATEMENT.

<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Tobacco Merchants Association (TMA) for on-line live access to industry information concerning economic, legislative, regulatory, trademark, brand and statistical data, market by market and company by company. The Government intends to award for a base period and two (2) option years.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has regularly accessed the TMA website for the past several years, in order to obtain tobacco information vital to its mission.  Available data bases provide statistical information, current legislation and regulatory trends, details of development of new products, company changes, and import/export data, all necessary for TTB analyses and compliance issues.  As no other product provides the aggregate of information needed by TTB personnel, a sole source to Tobacco Merchants Association is intended for this order.  No other known source provides the complete updated industry information. 
No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than five days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  Vendor shall provide company information, along with socio-economic status. If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to TMA.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

<DESC>Amendment 4 - questions previously omitted

Additional Questions:

1)	The current data files coming into FCA are in widely varying formats.  
?	Does the FCA have the statutory authority to dictate a common data format to its data supplying agencies?  Yes, but we do not plan to dictate a common data format for this project.  See also the answer to technical question 25.
2)	Will the contractor be providing the data supplying agencies guidance and/or programming assistance in converting their existing data feeds from current methods to the new XML method?  No.  See also the answer to technical question 29.
3)	Does FCA anticipate utilizing a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Extract-Transform-and-Load (ETL) tool such as Informatica or Oracle Warehouse Builder to perform the XML data receipt and database loading, or is a custom coded solution anticipated?
?	Is there such a tool already purchased within FCA and/or is there budget to procure such COTS tools?  No.  See also the answers to technical questions 9 and 46.
4)	The ?Data Collection and Storage? section states that a ?relational database design? is required, yet in other places the system is referred to as a ?data warehouse.?  [The typical database design for data warehouse reporting solutions is vastly different from a relational/transactional design.]
?	Which type of database design solution is anticipated here: a relational/transactional or a dimensional/reporting type database design?  See answer to technical question 25.  The current design is a relational database.  FCA wants the contractor to determine the best future database design.
5)	Reference is made to the need to remove Social Security Numbers and other sensitive data from the incoming feeds.  Will an independent Certification & Accreditation (C&A) process be required before the system can be opened to the internet?  Will the contractor be required to conduct and/or support this C&A process? What are the security requirements associated with deploying this system?  FCA is responsible for the security requirements of this system.
?	Will the contractor be responsible for conducting NIST or DoD level database security implementations to ensure the safety of data being handled within the system?  No.
6)	What does ?cost reimbursement? mean in terms of contract types?  Cost reimbursement in the RFQ means that, for task 6, an hourly rate will be used for services not to exceed a certain dollar amount identified in each task order.
7)	What is the level of Background check that will be required of contractors of FCA?  
a)	Will the simple submission of an SF-85p be sufficient, or will additional background checks such as credit checks, NCIC checks and full background investigations led by Security investigators be required?  
b)	Will these background checks be mandatory to be completed and accepted before work can commence on the project 
[problematic with the government?s current massive backlog of background investigations].  
c)	Can interim clearances be obtained while any full investigations are underway?
See answer to Contract/Proposal Question 3. NACIs will be required of contractors.  SF-85s are sufficient.  Interim clearances can be obtained


The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) has an immediate need for services from a qualified person(s) who is knowledgeable of and experienced in relational database management design and development, as well as data loading and mining operations.  The Contractor will assist FCA in developing a database to accumulate and store the loan portfolio data submitted by FArm Credit System institutions to the FCA.  The database will enhance the data interrogation capabilities of the FCA's examination and regulation and policy development staff by consolidating System data into a single database with comparable data fields.  The data tables will facilitate macro analysis of oversight of the System.  


Interested parties should contact Reevest@fca.gov for a complete Statement of Work.  

Questions will be received through November 30, 2007, at 2:00 PM EST.  An amendment will be posted answering questions December 4, 2007.

Proposals should be sent to Reevest@FCA.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST, Wednesday, December 12, 2007.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

The FCA is a nonappropriated fund activity not subject to GAO's bid protest provisions.  Any claim for relief filed by an offeror shall be adjudicated by the FCA Contracting Officer.  If the parties cannot reach an agreement mutually satisfactory after diligently pursuing a solution through discussions and negotiations, the FCA Contracting Officer shall make a final decision.  The FCA Contracting Officer's decision shall prevail unless the offeror submits an appeal to the FCA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Stephen G. Smith.  The decision of the CFO shall be final and binding on the parties.

n or whether a new column will be added to the SQL Server table.
43.	Can you provide the details of the current mapping that has been identified so far as described in the task 4?   See Question 39 above.

Task 5 ? Data Views

44.	Can you specify the approximate number of views need to be created for task 5?  12 views or less.
45.	Do you require that the views created in task 5, be accessible via a web browser?  If not, how do you envision that users/offices view the data?  FCA users do not require a web browser to access the views.  They will use MS Office tools to query the data.
46.	Please advise what reporting tool FCA plans to use.  Will it simply be custom views created in Oracle/SQL Query or is there a different COTS product that will be utilized?  FCA will query the tables as well as the custom views.
47.	How many standard views are being requested under this fixed price portion of the contract?  12 views or less.  Can these be determined before the data model is finalized? Are there some existing today that can be shared before submission?  One of the evaluation criteria is "Understanding of the desired data warehouse and related views." Is there a description of the desired views available?  No.
48.	Project task #5 requires the contractor to "develop a collection of standard data views based on user requirements."
?	Do user requirements already exist? No.
?	If not, does the requirement gathering effort need to be accounted for in the proposal cost?  No.
?	If requirements do exist, is there an approximate number of known views that need to be created?  12 views or less.
?	If requirements do exist, what are the views that need to be created?  Details will be provided once the contract is awarded.
?	Is there a standard format/tool/technology that FCA uses for data views?  No.
49.	In Task 5 - Will the end users for the central database be only the "Offices" (OE, ORP and OMS)?  Only FCA staff will access the views.
50.	In Task 5 - Does each Office have a list of the data and concept of how they want to see the data displayed in the final product?  If so, can they give more details about what type of information they would like to see in their individual reports, or would FCA prefer to wait until the contract has been awarded to address the particulars of the reports?  The contract does not call for the development of reporting tools.
51.	In Task 5 ? Each office (OE, ORP and OMS) would like to see segregated data views.  Do they require entirely different screens to view the data or just an ability to see the data differently?  Does each office require a web-based interface that is accessible from various locations, or will access to the database be restricted to use at OE? Or is a different type of access required?  FCA will provide more detailed specifications on the views after the contract is awarded.
52.	In Task 5 - If each "Office" (OE, ORP and OMS) needs different data views, would these screens or views be accessible only by the office requesting them, or should the screens be available to all three Offices (i.e., should OE have access to the customized screens requested by ORP?).  The views will be available to all FCA staff with access to the database.

<DESC>Amendment 3 - questions/answers
26.	Is it expected that the current delivery method will suffice, or should a standard delivery method be included as part of the proposed effort?  FCA expects that contractor will develop an application that will automatically load the received datasets into SQL Server and that any errors will be logged and sent to appropriate FCA staff for their action.
27.	What is the preferred method for handling errors in uploaded data?  Do we have to develop any workflow process to handle data validation errors? If so, can you describe the process that needs to be developed?  FCA expects that the contractor will develop an application that will automatically load the datasets into SQL Server and that any errors will be logged and sent to appropriate FCA staff for their action. 
28.	What kind of technology infrastructure exists today for the different agencies to upload the files?  Is it .NET based or java based?  Does the agency have any preference to which technology should be used for building the web interface to upload the data?  The SOW does not request that a web interface be developed to upload the data.  This application should be built using Microsoft Visual Studio. 
29.	The SOW states that data files are in various formats (Access, Excel, and delimited text); however, there is a later statement in the SOW that states "the contractor will automate the process that takes the submitted XML files from the FCA's web site and loads them into the target database."  I am confused as to whether the data files are in raw formats (Access, Excel, text delimited) or if the files are already in a standard XML format.  FCA currently receives files in Access, Excel and comma-delimited format.  The institutions may choose to submit the files in XML in the future.
30.	Can you please clarify the format of the data files?
?	If the files are in raw format, is it required to first turn the raw format into XML, and then load the XML file into the database?  No.
?	Is there a reason that raw formatted files cannot be directly loaded into the database?  No.
31.	The FCA will continue to accept new data elements. Is there a change control policy in place for modifying the XML schema?  No, FCA accepts any format.  Are there any constraints on the type of software for building the user interface?  FCA is not requesting that a user interface to the institutions be built.  FCA wants an application to be developed that will automate the loading the files received from the institutions.  This application should be built using Microsoft Visual Studio.
32.	Under the project background section there is a desire to continue to accept new data elements from institutions when they want to provide more information to FCA while under the Scope section there is a requirement to develop an xml schema to replace the current ad-hoc method of data submission. Is there a change control policy in place for modifying the xml schema? Can there be a freeze on the XML schema while development is taking place? No, FCA will continue to accept new data elements during the duration of this contract.
33.	In the introduction paragraph under SCOPE, it says ?The database structures will be populated with data using XML and also using the current methods described above.?  Does FCA want to continue to be able to receive data transfers from the district offices or other providers in MS Access, MS Excel and text files?  Yes.  Does FCA want the contractor?s DBA to manage ongoing loading of such data? No.
34.	In the introduction paragraph under SCOPE  - Is there a specific reason that FCA prefers XML-format?  Does FCA plan to use this data for other purposes, or do they simply favor XML for other reasons?  An XML format can affect performance on large uploads and requires larger storage space than other formats.  XML is vendor neutral and provides maximum flexibility to the institutions in the generation of their data sets.
35.	In Task 2 - Does FCA want to make the upload user-interface available to all of the 95 offices, or just the 5 district offices?  FCA has developed a method for the institutions to submit the datasets on FCA?s web site.  As Task 2 is defined in the SOW: The Contractor will automate the process that takes the submitted files and loads them into the target database.  The Contractor will also automate the process of identifying new data fields that are submitted by the institutions.  Additionally, the Contractor will work with FCA to develop checks between this new data system and FCA's Call Report System (CRS) to ensure the data in this new data system are reasonable before the data are made available to FCA's users.
36.	In Task 2 ? ?the Contractor will work with FCA to develop checks between this new data system and FCA's Call Report System.?   Does each upload to the central db at OE need to be checked against the CRS each time or is the check against the CRS a one-time check to verify the data from the new solution is coming in correctly?  Each upload needs to be error checked and validated.
37.	In Task 2 ? What would FCA like to check in relation to the Call Report System (CRS) and will the CRS continue to operate after the implementation of the new system?  Can we get a description of what the CRS is and how the data is verified currently?  The total book volume received in the datasets for an institution is compared to the total loan volume for the institution in CRS. This is done with a simple query of CRS and the two values should be within 10% of each other.  FCA may want to add several other simple validations.
38.	In Task 2 ?Where/When is the CRS currently run (in the main database, through another program?)?  It would be helpful to get the specifications on how this system runs and what it does to check the data so that we can write a program that will be compatible.  See answer to question 37.

Tasks 3 & 4 - Data Collection/Storage/Mapping

39.	Data Collection, Mapping, Views ? Does FCA have an estimate of the amount of data?  For example, the number of records overall?  The number of records uploaded monthly?  

AgFirst District data set is provided in a zipped MS Access database for each institution.  The total district data is approximately 150MB zipped and includes over 150,000 data rows.

The Texas District provides data for its 20 affiliated associations.  The submission includes active and inactive loans as well as informational records on gross participation credits.  A typical monthly submission from this district is about 3Gs and includes around 70,000 data rows.

The Agribank District provides two databases. Total size is approximately 600MB and includes around 355,000 data rows.

The Wichita submission is approximately 20MB and includes almost 50,000 data rows. 

There are approximately 23 other institutions that do not use one of the above service providers.  We refer to these as the Independents.  
 

40.	In Task 3 - Is the focus of the data to monitor banks and banking activities, or to monitor the performance of the loan portfolio in relation to timely payments and performance?  Or both?  FCA wants to measure credit quality and mission performance.  However, Task 3 is about data collection and storage.
41.	In Task 3 - Does FCA need any reports that would calculate functions relative to mortgage repayment schedules or amortizations?   No.
42.	In Task 4 ? FCA has outlined a requirement to automate the mapping of new data sets: ?The data maps, related look-up tables and scripts will be automated to the maximum extent possible?. What is the expectation for this requirement since new data fields can be added by any of the 95 contributing offices without giving FCA prior warning?   FCA would like the data load system that the contractor will develop to alert selected staff when new data elements are received from the institutions.  FCA will then determine whether the new data elements fit an existing columnal and binding on the parties.

9.	Is there any pending or new legislation relative to FCA or rural lending that would impact what should be included in this solution?  No.

Technical Questions ? General

1.	What is the type of database in use? ( Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, MySQL etc.)  The work completed to date on this project is in MS Access.  However, the server database that will be used for this project is Microsoft SQL Server.
2.	What is the operating system being used?  Microsoft Windows 2003.
3.	What is the version of Access DB?  FCA accepts any version of MS Access from the institutions.
4.	When will the FCA decide which database management system to use? Can this decision be made before bids are submitted?    FCA has selected Microsoft SQL Server 2005.
5.	Can we use SQL Server 2005 to consolidate the data from other sources? Yes, FCA expects that the contractor will consolidate the disparate data into a central SQL Server database for easy access by FCA staff.
6.	Please provide the version of Microsoft SQL Server that FCA currently owns.  Microsoft SQL Server 2005.
7.	Please advise what Oracle products you currently own and plan to utilize outside of the standard DBMS (if any such products exist). We do not plan to use our Oracle 10 database for this project.
8.	In the introduction paragraph under SCOPE - Will this solution run on a new server or a currently installed server.  The database will run on an existing server.  If it will be a currently installed server, can we get the specifications on the machine that will host the new application prior to its installation?  FCA?s server is appropriately provisioned.  FCA is using Microsoft SQL Server 2005 running on Windows 2003.
9.	Are there any restrictions on other technologies used apart from Oracle/SQL Server?  For example: Could we use a desktop based application built in Microsoft's .Net for tasks like loading and monitoring of dataloads and rules configuration?  FCA would like programming to be done using any of the following tools: MS Office, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Actuate Reports.  FCA will own the code produced by the contractors.
10.	In the database management what portion of the work involves development?  FCA defined the work to be performed in the SOW.
11.	What level and kind of documentation is expected?  A workflow diagram and complete description of how the developed solutions work.  FCA also expects that a data dictionary will be developed for each table, view and column.
12.	Is there a preferred project planning tool?  FCA does not have a preferred project planning tool.  
13.	Can we substitute other database design, management and administration experience in the place of loan portfolios?  No.

15.	Could we get the table structure of any existing Oracle/SQL Server databases? No, there are no existing Oracle/SQL Server databases that hold these databases.
16.	At what point in time is the agency willing to share the structures and schema of the Microsoft Access databases, including the tables, queries, reports, etc, in order for preliminary design work to be undertaken by vendors?  FCA will share the details on the database once the contract is awarded.
17.	What are the hours of required support?  (e.g. 9-5, 24/7, etc).  Support will only be provided for Task 6 which FCA may optionally choose to invoke on an hourly rate.  For this task the contractor will actually perform the data load on a periodic basis.
18.	Is there any need to develop a front end web application for reporting purposes, once the data is loaded into a new database, assuming it is MS SQL Server 2005?  The contract does not call for the development of reporting tools.
19.	How many end users currently use the existing data? Approximately 100 users. And how many systems does the proposed new database serve?  Tables and views will be created in an existing SQL Server installation.  FCA will develop its own reports that query the data in the new tables and/or views.
20.	Can we assume that there is no additional work needed to support the legacy process other than automatically upload the files to the database?  Yes.
21.	Is FCA open to using BizTalk Server 2006 integrating external FCAs, so that we can continue to accept the submissions from external agencies and keep populating a proposed SQL server 2005 database?  No.


Task 2 - Data Upload

22.	What is the frequency and the size/transactions per file of the data files coming in? We understand that they vary; we are looking for peak load, the largest files and the most number of files in a given day/week/month/quarter.  The AgFirst, Texas District and Wichita databases are received monthly.  The plan is for the remaining datasets to be submitted quarterly.  See Question 39 below for the size.
23.	Can the MS Access database be provided with the data removed?  Can the current schema be provided prior to proposal submission? Would it be possible to provide the current schema definitions for the files uploaded by e

It is acceptable to either provide a total fixed cost for Tasks 1-5, or provide a break out of the hourly rates according to the type of work/skill set required.  However, if you provide hourly rates for the various tasks, please also provide a total fixed cost for Tasks 1-5.  For task 6, only an hourly rate is required.
10.	Is it a fixed price contract?  As detailed in the SOW under the heading ?Contract Type and Term? this is a fixed-price contract for Tasks 1-5.  Task 6 will be provided at a fixed hourly rate and will be completed under specific task orders as issued by FCA.
11.	The SOW states that this is Fixed Price Contract for Project Tasks 1 to 5 and for Project Task 6 is on Fixed Hourly rate.  We assume that we provide fixed price for the Project Task 1 to 5 and we provide Fixed hourly rates for the Possible Job Positions required for executing Task 6 in our price Proposal. Kindly clarify if our assumption is correct.  Yes, this is correct.
12.	What is the anticipated level of effort in terms of man hours for each task? Do you have an estimate of how many FTE, this effort may require?  We do not have a predetermined estimate of man hours for each task, this should be determined by the contractor and included in your proposal.
13.	The SOW states that the "FCA has an immediate need for services from a qualified person...".  The SOW also indicates that "experience and ability of key personnel are important factors...".  The first statement strongly indicates that FCA is looking for a single, qualified individual while the technical factors indicate multiple personnel are expected. Is the scope of tasks 1-5 limited to a single person? Is the scope of task 6 limited to a single person?  Does FCA anticipate finding one person qualified enough to perform all the lifecycle database system tasks specified in the SOW?  We do not have a requirement on the number of persons to complete the job.  The contractor may use different personnel to complete the various tasks as long as the project is supervised by a single project manager.
14.	Is this a full time opportunity or part time?  The contract is based on the tasks to be completed under the timeframes defined in ?Contract Type and Term.?  The level of employment can be determined by the contractor as long as the timeframes for completion of the tasks are met.
15.	Does FCA envision a single person, or a team? Is this a one or two person requirement?  We do not have a requirement on the number of persons to complete the job.
16.	Is there a government estimated level of work in terms of hours? No.
17.	What is the expected number of hours of support required for task 6? We do not have a predetermined number of hours for the support discussed in Task 6.
18.	Does the infrastructure already exist (i.e. is hardware & software GFE)?  Or should the cost of hardware and software be included as part of the proposal cost?  Yes, the infrastructure already exists and; therefore, hardware and software should NOT be included as part of the proposal cost.
19.	Is it safe to assume that all the development licenses for the tools to develop the proposed effort will be provided by FCA? Yes.
20.	Do we need to submit representative resumes of our personnel in our response? Does the person need to have any industry level certifications?  Yes, the contractor should provide resumes for all employees expected to perform work on the SOW.  The resumes should include the employee?s relevant industry level certifications or relevant experience to the tasks defined in the SOW.  The resumes should also provide documentation on the type of background checks performed.
21.	The RFP states ?payment upon completion of the first 5 Project Tasks?.  Does this imply that payment may be invoiced after each individual task is completed OR after all five are completed? Can partial payments be made at some agreed upon milestones when the project plan is developed?  FCA is amenable to partial payments as we deem appropriate.  This option will be discussed once the contract is awarded.


The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) has an immediate need for services from a qualified person(s) who is knowledgeable of and experienced in relational database management design and development, as well as data loading and mining operations.  The Contractor will assist FCA in developing a database to accumulate and store the loan portfolio data submitted by FArm Credit System institutions to the FCA.  The database will enhance the data interrogation capabilities of the FCA's examination and regulation and policy development staff by consolidating System data into a single database with comparable data fields.  The data tables will facilitate macro analysis of oversight of the System.  


Interested parties should contact Reevest@fca.gov for a complete Statement of Work.  

Questions will be received through November 30, 2007, at 2:00 PM EST.  An amendment will be posted answering questions December 4, 2007.

Proposals should be sent to Reevest@FCA.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST, Wednesday, December 12, 2007.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

The FCA is a nonappropriated fund activity not subject to GAO's bid protest provisions.  Any claim for relief filed by an offeror shall be adjudicated by the FCA Contracting Officer.  If the parties cannot reach an agreement mutually satisfactory after diligently pursuing a solution through discussions and negotiations, the FCA Contracting Officer shall make a final decision.  The FCA Contracting Officer's decision shall prevail unless the offeror submits an appeal to the FCA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Stephen G. Smith.  The decision of the CFO shall be fiach association?  May we please have an example of the formats and data in the current Access, Excel and delimited text files? Are examples available of the data to be uploaded?  FCA is currently receiving the loan datasets in about 30 different formats.  This situation is not expected to change.  See also question 25.
24.	Can you tell me the total number of XML files that this project will involve and how many database files will need to be created?  So, is this 1-1 database mapping or 1 to multiple?  See question 25.
25.	What is the current process of uploading the files by various agencies?  Email, upload from a web site, FTP, etc? How do external agencies submit data to FCA, using a front end web application or via FTP?  The primary mode of data submission is via CD.  The districts prepare the data extracts and burn then to a CD.  The CD is received in the geographic field offices and the contents are manually copied to the McLean server.  The exception to this process is the institutions which do not utilize a bank and their service providers.   For these institutions the data is transmitted via the FCA E-portal and then copied to the McLean server. 

FCA is currently receiving the loan datasets in about 30 different formats.  This situation is not expected to change.  The majority of the data is received from one of four district banks (see question 39).  There are three institutions that provide unique data extracts.  The remaining institutions provide a limited data extract of approximately 70 elements.  These remaining institutions are not identical but do follow an agreed to format with minimal variation.  

Data from the district banks is received periodically (monthly or quarterly) via CD.  The other institutional data is received via the FCA E-portal.  The raw data is copied to a server for storage.  The data for each institution is individually batch processed when needed.  While the SOW must be able to work with our current protocol for data transmission and format (as discussed previously), the protocol may evolve toward more e-portal transmissions.  Nevertheless, loading of data will remain a batched process for the foreseeable future.

Currently the data processing is a very labor intensive and manual process.  FCA personnel must link the raw data file to an MS Access file which runs a series of queries to translate the submitted data format and fields to my standard data set.  We also add the Institution identifier and data keys at this point.  Aberrations in the received data is identified through query failures and resolved.  There is a unique set of queries for each of the submitted format.  The result is a data set consisting of 500 data element in 5 tables.  The total book value for a processed institution is compared to the CRS reported loan volume for validation.  Note, we process each data file (ie institution) individually and must repeat the process for each data submission.  

A key component of this project is to automate the protocol for processing of the data.  FCA expects that the contractor will develop an application that will automatically load the datasets into SQL Server and that any errors will be logged and sent to appropriate FCA staff for their action. The output will be a consolidated data set at recurring points in time (quarterly).   After the data is loaded into the tables, views will be created in an existing SQL Server installation.  FCA will develop its own reports that query the data in the new tables and/or views.


The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) has an immediate need for services from a qualified person(s) who is knowledgeable of and experienced in relational database management design and development, as well as data loading and mining operations.  The Contractor will assist FCA in developing a database to accumulate and store the loan portfolio data submitted by FArm Credit System institutions to the FCA.  The database will enhance the data interrogation capabilities of the FCA's examination and regulation and policy development staff by consolidating System data into a single database with comparable data fields.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625445 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This is a unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS is 332999.  

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.
