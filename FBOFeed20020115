<DESC>NA See note 22.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is contemplating an addition to an existing contract with SAIC for specialized analysis to evaluate the vulnerability of critical federal governing centers and critical infrastructure sites.  It is anticipa ted the contractor will employ state of the art Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural dynamics (CSD) methodologies. Pre-processing of both the structural data and the fluid dynamics environment will be performed using a graphic pr e-processor that also specifies all grid generator and fluid/structure solver boundary conditions and element size definition for both the CFD and the CSD.  The flow solver will be a 3-D adaptive, unstructured, edge-based hydro solver based on the finite-e lement method flux-corrected transport concept.  The structural dynamics solver will be an unstructured, explicit finite element code.   Results of the analysis will enable the contractor to recommend protective-preventative measures.

Variance Estimation Procedures for the 
National Compensation Survey (NCS)and the Employment Cost Index (ECI)

Description of Work

Services are needed to give BLS the ability to provide satisfactory variance estimates for the NCS and ECI.  Research will be carried out to develop and assess the properties of new techniques tailor-made for these surveys. 

Supporting Statement

I.	Introduction

Until recently the ECI was a broad national survey.  It is now in transition to being based on a sub-sample of the NCS, so that it is now PSU based.  Within industrial strata, there are on average less than one establishment per stratum, even when strata are merged to contain two PSUs.  This creates serious complications for variance estimation.  In particular in forming variance strata, the choice of units (establishments) from distinct PSUs is not independent, as generally assumed for standard variance estimation procedures.  Thus there is a need for a variance estimation methodology that can be shown to accommodate this fact.

II.	Objectives
The objective of the project is to complete development of variance estimation procedures that take into account recent changes in the sample design for NCS and ECI, the theory that justifies them, and empirical work that shows their feasibility and effectiveness.

III.	Description of Project
The project will retain the services of Professor Suojin Wang of Texas A&M University, the contractor, to collaborate with OSMR and OCWC-SMD in carrying out research into variance estimation under the conditions of the NCS sample design, with special regard to the special problems of the ECI sample design.

IV.	Scope of Work
The services rendered will consist of research by Professor Wang into variance estimation methodology, which allows for imputation of data, with special attention to methods of imputation that have been suggested by the OCWC Imputation Team.  Additionally, attention will be paid to the ECI, which under recent changes in sample design poses unusual complications for

<DESC>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to award a sole source modification to Contract No. NRC-33-01-175 with FileNET Corporation, to acquire additional professional services to provide software support for the FileNET document management software suite used by the NRC for the Agency-Wide Document Access and Management System (ADAMS).  ADAMS is a customized document management system, with a FileNET integrated document management (IDM) foundation.  It is comprised of a distributed IDM document services system with two WAN nodes.  The software support is required to implement specific upgrades/migration to the current versions of the software and to implement operational configuration changes to improve operational efficiency, stability, and reliability.  The period of performance for the contract will be extended by an additional 24 months to span 4 years.  This support can only be provided by FileNET due to the proprietary nature of the software source code, logic, diagrams/manuals, and schematics.  Interruption in these services would impact the NRC's ability to use ADAMS to retrieve Agency records vital to regulatory decision making and would restrict public access to Agency documents.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>NA Request for Information The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is considering awarding Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for nuclear technology research and development.  Specific areas for research and development include electromagnetic protection and  lethality and system design & assessment.  We anticipate the award of three contracts, two of which will be set aside for small business participation, using thorough competition.  The estimated program value is approximately $50M/year.  We are currently soliciting input from industry to help refine our acquisition strategy.  We are particularly interested in industries view toward the feasibility of the project, core skills, risks, and Small Business participation.  A detailed statement of objectives and  additional information can be found at http://tdic.dtra.mil/. The major change between this announcement and the previous announcement of 24 October 2001 is the deletion of most nuclear phenomenology objectives and tasks.  This effort now consists of two major R&D areas:  Electromagnetic Protection and Lethality and Design and Assessment Technology.  The previous requirements document has been modified, deleting the nuclear phenomenology paragraph 3.3.  A new core skills paragraph, 3.0, has been added, and the specific objectives paragraph has been changed from 3.0 to  paragraph 4.0.  Paragraph 4.1, Electromagnetic Protection and Lethality, is identical to the former paragraph 3.1, Electromagnetics, except that a new subparagraph 4.1.5, High Power Electromagnetic Weapons Lethality Assessment/Analysis Tools Development, has been added.  Design and Assessment Technology remains unchanged.   We welcome comments and concerns regarding this proposed acquisition. All recommendations, comments, and questions must be submitted through email or the web site. This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitu te a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  This synopsis is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The Government will not pay for information received  as a result of this announcement.  To gain access to the web page potential offerors, who have not already done so, must register and obtain a password.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Dr. Mary-Jeanne Adler, Head of the Hydrological Database and Methodology Department, National Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Water Management, Department of Hydrological Database and Meteorology, Sos, Bucharest-Poiesti , Nr. 97, Sector 1, Bucharest, Romania, Tel: + 40-1230-90-32, Fax: + 40-1230-31-43, Email: adler@meteo.inmh.ro .

DESWAT Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on hydrological forecasting models needed to implement a viable nationwide emergency management program in Romania.

Over the past several years, Romania has been ravaged by recurring floods that have caused dozens of fatalities and millions of dollars worth of economic damage.  The Government of Romania (GOR) has reported that economic losses due to flooding amount to over $18 million per year.  In response, GOR has proposed the Destructive Waters (DESWAT) project, which aims to minimize the socioeconomic impact of extreme meteorological events and accidental pollution spills.  The project will also facilitate international and regional cooperation through the exchange of hydrometeorological information.  DESWAT will develop an interactive weather processing system to ingest and analyze a massive volume of data from various sources (weather station sensors, radars, satellites).  The system will quickly interpret this data (running large-scale river forecast models) and generate forecast products.  These forecasts will be delivered to the public and external interfaces as required by the GOR.  

The DESWAT project will use resources and technology being acquired as part of the Romanian National Integrated Meteorological System (SIMIN project).  This is a project of the Romanian National Institute of Hydrology and is being carried out by Lockheed Martin.  The SIMIN project will provide real-time capabilities to detect, monitor and forecast hydrometeorological conditions in Romania.  

The river flood forecasting models investigated for the DESWAT project will have the capability and robustness of the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) FLDWAV river flood routing models.  The DESWAT river flood forecasting models will feature interactive capability to produce rapid issuance and updates of river forecasts. 

The objective of this feasibility study is to assess several hydrological forecasting models needed to implement a viable emergency management program in Romania.  This program will include a weather interactive processing system for ingesting and analyzing a massive volume of data from station sensors, radars, satellites, and other sources to quickly interpret this data; running large-scale river forecast models; and generating and distributing forecast products to the public and external interfaces as required by the Romanian Ministry of Waters and Environmental Protection.  The feasibility study will also assess the financial and economic feasibility of the DESWAT project.
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $371,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September, 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $18.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. J. Emmett Ward, Brookeville, Maryland, to provide expert technical services to the NIH Business and Research Support System (NBRSS) Project.  These services are related specifically to technical and related administration issues and activities on the NBRSS project.  NIH recently completed a comprehensive management and systems analysis to define the requirements for a new administrative computing system and evaluated potential systems to satisfy these requirements.  This analysis has determined that the NIH must replace its current system with an off-the-shelf software product. As part of this implementation, NIH has engaged the services of numerous functional specialists to help design and configure the software to suit NIH needs.  NIH is seeking the assistance from an individual with a detailed understanding of NIH technical and administrative systems, particularly with the Administrative Data Base (ADB).  NIH requires the detailed technical services to support the NBRSS project for a period of 2 years and 6 months.  Specifically, the contractor shall support the NBRSS Project Manager in the following areas: Participating in the final system design for each functional area including: 1) Helping to establish migration, implementation, and test plans for the NBRSS. 2) Participating in the development of training plans. 3) Participating in the testing, documentation and deployment of the NBRSS system.  4) Providing assistance in the design and configuration of the system, including workflow and deployment activities. 5) Performing policy and issue analyses for the NBRSS Project on a myriad of topics as assigned by the Project Manager.  Following these analyses, the contractor prepares draft policy documents/memoranda/reports/presentations for NBRSS review.

Mr. Ward has provided technical services to the National Institutes of Health for over 30 years as a Government employee.  Mr. Ward's previous experience as a technical expert with NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) uniquely qualifies him as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary technical services.  This requirement represents a continuation of the services he is currently providing to the NBRSS project.  He therefore will require no orientation to NIH technical and related administrative issues. He has an extensive knowledge of NIH technical and administrative systems, particularly with the Administrative Data Base (ADB).

Mr. Ward has vast technical knowledge of the type required by the NBRSS project.  NIH has determined that Mr. Ward is the only source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience that can successfully complete the requirements listed above.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Competitive Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NIH.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable  Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this or

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

Box 400, Columbia, MD 21045:  technical and engineering services to support CEC Battle Group Interoperability and CEP IV & tasking.  The Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) is a system of hardware and software that allows the sharing of radar data of air targets among ships and by other aircraft and land-based systems.  Radar data is transmitted via a line-of-sight Data Distribution System (DDS).  Each ship uses similar data processing algorithms resident in the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP), resulting in each ship having essentially the same display of track information on aircraft and missiles.  The result of this combined processed radar track data is an engagement quality track that can be engaged by the optimum system.   The contractor shall focus on data analysis tasks in the areas of CEC equipped battle group interoperability analysis and CEP IV&V testing.  Data analysis tasks shall include but not be limited to analysis of CEP. AEGIS C&D and C2P data.  Specific items considered may be dictated by requests from deployed battle groups.

The estimated solicitation issue date is 31 January 2002.  The award is anticipated by 31 March 2002.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area, therefore the synopsis/solicitation with any applicable amend ments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil.supply.  Hard copies will not be provided.  Vendors should regularly access the NSWCDD website to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments.   Miranda, Inc. possesses intimate knowledge of interoperability issues and experience in developing specialized interoperability analysis tools.

This contributes to Miranda, Inc. being the only contractor that has the necessary skills and experience in Tactical Digital Information Link to accomplish the contract taskings.       Interested parties other than Miranda, Inc. must be able to demonstrate, in writing, their capability to provide the requested services.   NUMBERED NOTE 22 APPLIES

<DESC>The Information Technology Omnibus Procurement (ITOP) Program Office operates as a fee for service business practice within the Department of Transportation, Transportation Administrative Service Center (TASC).  The ITOP Program Office provides IT consulting and contracting to a wide variety of government entities.   The ITOP program was initiated to streamline government procurements of Information Technology (IT) services.  Currently, the program administers two multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, ITOP and ITOP II, which are Government-wide Agency Contracts (GWACs) worth a total value of $11 Billion.  The ITOP Program Office is seeking to identify sources that will provide expert acquisition support for the ITOP Program.  These sources cannot be ITOP Prime Contractors.  

Through the use of ITOP, customers will have a flexible means of meeting IT needs quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively.   ITOP was designed to provide our customers with highly skilled, responsible contractors (large, small, and 8(a)) who possess a wide variety of expertise.  It is ITOP's goal, with industry partners, to continue to provide innovative solutions to meet information technology requirements that are advantageous to our clients in all government entities.  

The federal acquisition community (including both the information technology/CIO community and the procurement community) has been subject to significant reform initiatives over the past several years.  These reform measures ? such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), as well as the more recent Presidential and OMB directives to increase the use of performance-based contracting techniques have significantly changed the federal government?s approach to acquiring goods and services. 

Many federal agencies are having difficulties fully understanding and implementing these reform measures and streamlining practices and procedures.  There is a shortage of experience and expertise in effectively implementing acquisition reform measures. 

Finally, acquisition organizations across government are beset with a dwindling resource pool, both in terms of reduced funding (in many instances), reduced in-house expertise, and reduced staffing, both in technical and contractual support of the acquisition process.  This problem is exacerbated by the recent inclusion of inherently governmental functions on the FAIR Act inventory requiring Agencies to seek alternatives to existing acquisition management functions currently accomplished by in-house staff.  The legislative requirements, regulatory initiatives and dwindling resource pool all combine to require acquisition organizations to take innovative and aggressive steps to plan, control, and manage acquisitions.  This not only includes innovative ways to manage existing contracts, but also innovative ways to acquire new or additional resources.  Thus, there is a broad need for expert acquisition support services and products.  Therefore, ITOP seeks to establish a broad suite of expert acquisition support capability that would provide such capability to any government agency in an efficient, cost effective manner.  The expert acquisition support services requested are other than the TASC Procurement Support Service Solicitation number DTTS59-01-R-00444.  Contractors may access the aforementioned solicitation under http://www.fedbizopps.gov.    The ITOP Program Office is seeking expert solutions to current Government contractual actions.  Furthermore, the ITOP Program Office is seeking highly skilled acquisition experts that can provide total professional acquisition solutions to enhance the quality of the ITOP Program.

Therefore, and in accordance with the FAR 15.202 advisory multi-step process, ITOP seeks statements of qualifications from firms who provide a broad suite of expert acquisition support services.  Award of

<DESC>Based on comments received concerning testing procedures for recovering erased audio from 1/4 inch analog magnetic recording tape the testing procedures will be modified to more accurately represent the original Nixon White House recordings. There will be two test tapes. Both test tapes will be recorded on an original White House Sony audio recorder then erased on an original White House UHER audio recorder as determined by the May 31, 1974 report to Judge Sirica by the Advisory Panel on White House Tapes. Test tape one will be on 1.0 mil 1/4-inch analog tape stock recorded at 7.5 IPS. This will be of best quality as possible. Test tape two will be an audio excerpt from the DAT Preservation copy of Tape 342 at the level of the original recording. This tape will be recorded at 15/16 IPS on original White House .5 mil 1/4-inch audiotape stock.  All vendors that have submitted techical capability statements do not have to submit any additional information.  Any vendors which have not submitted technical capability statements and wish to do so because of the changes outlined above may do so until 4:30 PM EST January 25, 2002

<DESC>SOLICITATION FOR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER (CM) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2101, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO26000.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about June 20, 2001.  Estimated Cost Range:  $750,000 maximum.  Time for completion:  365 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  Project involves:  for building construction projects having a construction cost less than $10,000,000 located in the City of St. Louis, the State of Missouri east of Columbia and the State of Iowa east of Newton.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, develop management plan, schedule, budget, studies); (2) Design Phases Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting redlined as-built drawings to CAD drawings): and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,000,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded in the initial period (1-year) will be $5,000 per firm/joint venture and a minimum of $5,000 per firm/joint venture for each of the exercised option periods.  The maximum amount payable under each contract shall not exceed $1,000,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractor's performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year periods.  The successful CM contractor, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A-E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the "best value concept" in selecting a CM.  The "best value concept" is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a June 20, 2001.  Proposals shall be received in this office on or about July 24, 2001.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Pers

<DESC>SUBJECT: R--DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION SUPPORT FOR THE US PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

INTRODUCTION:  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research to identify organizations that have the technical capabilities to perform document classification for the USPTO. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged. There is no solicitation available at this time nor is there any guarantee or promise of a solicitation in the future. Any information provided to USPTO as a result of this announcement shall focus on the capability to provide scientific and technical services, as defined below.  Strong relationships with industry is a top priority of USPTO, and USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all industry entities that choose to provide information in accordance with this announcement.

BACKGROUND: Currently, patent applications receive a security screening and are classified during initial processing according to US standards (reflected in the US Patent Classification [USPC] Handbook) and/or international standards (reflected in the International Patent Classification [IPC] Handbook).  Patent applications are loosely grouped within one of three disciplines: Chemical, Electrical, or Mechanical.  Each application is assigned an initial or routing classification sufficient to ensure its direction to the appropriate Tech Center and Art Unit for purposes of examination.  This initial classification consists of a class and, when necessary, a subclass indicative of the appropriate Art Unit.  Following its receipt in the Tech Center, each application determined to be eligible for pre-grant publication (PGPub) is assigned Mandatory and Discretionary Classifications (both US and IPC) and a representative figure (based on the application's claims) is selected for use in the PGPub publication cycle.  All classification information is entered into the Patent Application Locating and Monitoring system (PALM).

The USPTO is considering acquiring contract services to perform security screening, initial and PGPub classification, and designation of a representative figure for patent applications. Determining the appropriate classification(s) for an application requires knowledge and understanding of the U.S. and International Patent Classification Systems as well as technical knowledge sufficient to understand and analyze the technical patent application.  U.S. classifications are assigned by class/subclass; international classifications are assigned to the subgroup level.

USPTO is also seeking industry opinions concerning performance-based contracting measurements.  Specifically, USPTO would like to gather opinions as to what measurements a contractor might feel would be applicable for a potential contract for services described in this announcement.  Additionally, USPTO is seeking industry opinion as to what would be a fair and accurate methodology for assessing past performance for a potential solicitation regarding these services.  

SCOPE:  Any potential contractor would provide services to determine an initial (routing) classification for each application and enter this data into PALM. If required, security screening of an application must be completed prior to assigning an initial classification.  Assignment of PGPub classification(s) and indication of the drawing figure that is most descriptive of the claimed subject matter must also be completed and entered into PALM.  The assignment of initial and PGPub classifications may be consolidated into one step in the initial p

<DESC>The USDA, Rural Utilities Service, is conducting a market survey to determine whether there are additional sources to provide services for 90-150 circuit riders to operate a rural water technical assistance program in the 48 continental United States with the possibility of adding Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii at a later date.   Each circuit rider will be a full-time person with extensive experience in operating, maintaining, and managing rural water systems serving rural areas or cities/towns with a population of 10,000 or less.   Each circuit rider shall, at a minimum, possess multi-year experience in the actual operation and/or management of a public water system, and have an understanding of rural and small water system problems and how they may be resolved.  They shall provide technical assistance in the following major areas: operations; treatment; management; and compliance.  Technical assistance shall include on-site advice on water usage problems, establishing sound management and operating procedures, advising new systems on construction and water quality issues, and providing assistance on meeting Federal Safe Drinking Water Act standards.  The primary objective of the program is for the circuit rider to work alongside the rural water system officials and operators to show them how to solve their own problems.  Each circuit rider must be able to travel freely within his/her jurisdiction. The rural water circuit rider technical assistance program will provide two to three full-time personnel for each state except for Connecticut and Rhode Island which are served by two circuit riders, and Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire, which are served by two circuit riders.   If Puerto Rico, Alaska, or Hawaii are added, they will have one circuit rider.  The Contractor shall provide office space for each circuit rider in their jurisdiction.  This office space shall also serve as a central contact point for water systems eligible for program assistance.  In specific areas where a circuit rider may work multiple states, one office shall meet this requirement.  The Contractor shall provide automated data processing (ADP) and internet equipment in each office for documenting performance and funds expended, and for transferring files to the Contractor?s headquarters office for the circuit rider Program Manager and staff.  Circuit riders will be provided annually at least 70 hours of training by the Contractor to promote continuing education and the effectiveness of this contract. The Government may also exercise the option to complete optional work should the contract have sufficient funding available.  Interested parties should submit a statement of interest and capabilities, including brochures and descriptive literature on services now being performed that closely fit the above services.  The Government will review all submitted statements of capabilities to determine market availability of the required services.  At this time, a proposal is not required; therefore your response will not be considered an offer. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of any submission to this market survey to contract services.   Interested parties should submit a response to this market survey no later than February 5, 2002.   All correspondence should be addressed to Deborah Fletcher, USDA, Rural Development, Procurement Management Division 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, Mail Stop 0741, Washington, DC 20250-0741

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity (VaCA), on behalf of The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the Joint Intelligence Virtual Architecture (JIVA) program is seeking white papers for a highly integrated Knowledge Discovery (KD) toolkit.  This is a sources sought announcement. JIVA is a congressionally mandated program within the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP) and is the primary DOD intelligence community?s program for infusion of commercial information technology in support of intelligence analysis and production processes.  Because the desired suite of KD tools does not presently exist as an integrated set, development of the KD toolkit will likely be a technical and functional integration of emerging state of the art components with each other and within the JIVA Enterprise architectural framework.  White papers are being sought from both Industry and Government sources, and should specify a complete end-to-end solution that satisfies the top-level requirements identified below.  

The immediate goal is to identify candidate KD tools to evaluate as part of a JIVA lab-based concept exploration effort during the summer of 2002, with accreditation and deployment on the operational JIVA Enterprise in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2003.  

The KD toolkit is required to support immediate on-going DoD Intelligence Counter Terrorism efforts.  However, its use will likely extend beyond Counter Terrorism to the general military intelligence analyst population and the JIVA enterprise.  Traditional intelligence problems, such as assessing the military forces, capabilities, and intentions of foreign nations, generally involve analyzing data within both structured and unstructured databases and known hierarchies.  However, the asymmetric threat problem, specifically the terrorism threat, involves assimilating a great deal of data from the CIA, NSA, DoS, FBI and INS; Intelligence Community real time message feeds and mail systems; and open source HTML/XML and free text.  In addition, the Counter Terrorism analyst must often think outside the box in terms of established rational Western Standards of analysis and thus the ability to conduct what-if drills is paramount.  A central concept involves establishing relationships between data points and testing operational assumptions.  Nevertheless, because of the volume and inconsistency of raw data, it is imperative that proven analytical methodologies be applied and that advanced information technology tools are employed.

This KD toolkit is envisioned to provide the Counter Terrorism analyst with an end to end solution that can: (1) Create refined complex queries (searches) to manually identify/extract entities/relationships or the intelligent agents to find them automatically from the JIVA Virtual Knowledge Base (VKB), and potentially other compartmented data sources/repositories used by the CT community.  The evolving VKB contains all types of unclassified and classified multi-media, unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.  VKB will provide seamless access to intelligence counter terrorism data bases and other databases such as MIDB, MEPED, EWIR, and focus on global data access.  It will be important for the tools to filter out unnecessary data, process incoming data in near real time, apply analyst defined taxonomies, and store data in an ODBC/JDBC compliant database.  Analysts will need to be able to query sources using both natural language and key words.  This component is called the Advanced Data Mining component; (2) Visually recognize significant patterns, relationships, and timelines in those returned results.  It will be important for the analyst to exploit the data for further discovery.  This component is called the Data Visualization component; (3) Create and test hypotheses through a question and answer interface that can resolve ambiguities and enable the analyst to build and test what if scenarios.  This component is called the Question and

<SUBJECT>A -- OPTIMIZED ARRAY FOR SPACE-BACKGROUND INFRARED SIMULATION (OASIS)
<DESC>INTRODUCTION: This is a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA). The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNG) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development of advanced resistive array infrared scene projection integrated circuits (ICs) optimized for cryogenic operation and integration of those ICs into cryogenic infrared scene Projector Emitter Module's (Cryo-PEMs). Proposals in response to this PRDA must be received no later than 1:00 P.M. CST on 4 March 2002, addressed to Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Contracting Division, Bldg. 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn.: Ms Dona Dowdy-Merchant (AFRL/MNK). Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (May 2001)". Responders must reference the following number (MNK-PRDA-02-0004). Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement. Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement. Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published. The Government reserves the right to amend the due date to allow for subsequent submission-of-proposal dates. If a proposal is selected to satisfy the PRDA objectives as a result of the first submission, subsequent opportunities for proposal submission will not be available.  B-- REQUIREMENTS:  (1) Technical Description: Through research and development programs such as the Wideband Infrared Scene Projector (WISP) and the Multi-Spectral Scene Projector (MSSP) programs, resistive array infrared scene projector technology has demonstrated such desirable qualities as broad spectral emission, flickerless images, high frame rates, and large dynamic ranges.  Although resistor array infrared scene projector technology has greatly matured under the WISP and MSSP programs there are areas in which additional development is required to meet the needs of the hardware-in-the-loop test and evaluation community.  One of these facilities, the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator (KHILS) at Eglin, is designed to support various current and future Missile Defense Agency (MDA) guided interceptor hardware development programs. This closed-loop simulator facility evaluates advanced state-of-the-art seeker and control system performance under varying mission scenarios. The resistive array infrared projection technology also has direct application in the evaluation of air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, and surface-to-surface guided weapons and submunitions, which use infrared seekers.  Because of the rapid evolution of sensor and signal processor technologies, it is imperative that related simulation technologies keep pace with the advances in guided interceptor technology.  (2) Technical Goals:  The overall objective of this program is to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in resistive array infrared scene projection technology. Goals in descending order of importance (most to least): (a) Optimize the emitter material, on-chip analog electronics and other design features to increased radiometric output under cryogenic/vacuum environmental conditions, (b) High framing rates (200 frames per second), (c) High spatial resolution (512x512 and 1024x1024), (d) Minimization of scene droop, (e) Snapshot array updates, (f) Flexible array and package design for array operation at ambient through cryogenic temperatures, (g) Maximization of array fabrication yield, (h) Programmable frame windowing (addressing reduced portion of array), and (i) Programmable multiplexing of the number of control lines (user can trade between data rate and cost of drive electronics).  The offerors may include additional areas for trade in the first phase of the program.  This three-phased program of which two phases are optional is

FedFleetT2002 is a training opportunity designed to give agency personnel essential information for the management of the entire Federal motor vehicle fleet.  It is also designed to give agency personnel the opportunity to view and learn more about the latest in vehicle technology. On display at that information fair will be an exhibit on the 'fleet management system of the future'.  The exhibit will use the fleet management life cycle, that is, vehicles needs determination, acquisition, accountability & maintenance, and disposal as the framework and will demonstrate how each part of the fleet management life cycle might be done in the year 2010.  We are now looking for nonproprietary information about current products (software and hardware) and products under development that could be used in the vehicle fleet management system of the future (2010).  We may later seek to have some of these products displayed as part of a FedFleet2002 exhibit on the fleet management system of the future. Your written comments, suggestions, and ideas regarding this initiative are invited.  As indicated in FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  Please submit your information and ideas to R. Stewart Randall at GSA at stewart.randall@gsa.gov and or fax to telephone  (202) 501-1777.
