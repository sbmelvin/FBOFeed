<DESC><p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates posting a solicitation for proposals for a five (5) year (base period with four extension options) performance based cost plus award fee contract for the maintenance and fielding of the Patient Safety Organization Privacy Protection Center (PSO PPC) which will include collecting, processing, and analyzing patient safety data collected from Patient Safety Organizations; technical assistance with development and implementation of the AHRQ Common Formats; and coordination and conducting a PSO Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>AHRQ was designated by the Secretary to implement and administer the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act), and its regulations (the Patient Safety Rule) authorized the creation of Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), which collect, aggregate, and analyze confidential and privileged information regarding the quality and safety of healthcare. The goals of the Patient Safety Act are to encourage the expansion of voluntary, provider-driven initiatives to improve the quality and safety of health care; to promote rapid learning about the underlying causes of risks and harms in the delivery of health care; and, to share those findings widely, thus, speeding the pace of improvement. The Patient Safety Act also authorizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to facilitate the development of a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD), to which PSOs can voluntarily contribute non-identifiable patient safety event information. The NPSD will receive and report on non-identifiable, aggregated patient safety event information which will be included in AHRQ's annual National Healthcare Quality Report and National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHQR and NHDR). AHRQ understood the complexity of ensuring that information submitted to the NPSD was non-identifiable and the costs associated with adherence to the confidentiality provisions of the Patient Safety Rule. Therefore, AHRQ established the PSO Privacy Protection Center (PSOPPC) to assist PSOs and others with meeting the requirement that patient safety event information be made non-identifiable prior to sending to the NPSD. The PSOPPC will receive patient safety information in a standardized format (AHRQ Common Formats) and render it non-identifiable before transmitting it safely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>The Patient Safety Rule requires PSOs, to the extent practical and appropriate, to collect patient safety event data from providers in a standardized manner. AHRQ's common definitions, data elements, and reporting formats are known as Common Formats. The PSOPPC only accepts data represented as AHRQ's Common Formats. The PSO also delivers technical assistance to PSOs on the use of AHRQ's Common Formats.</p>
<p>The Common Formats include event descriptions, specifications for patient safety aggregate reports, delineation of data elements to be collected for different types of events, and technical specifications for electronic data collection and reporting. The technical specifications promote standardization of collected patient safety event information by stipulating rules for data collection and submission. The PSOPPC maintains the Common Formats and the technical specifications. The Common Formats and the associated technical specifications are available on the PSOPPC Web Site (www.psoppc.org).</p>
<p>The main requirement of this contract is to provide guidance to PSOs with using the Common Formats and rendering patient safety event information non-identifiable. The PSOPPC&nbsp;shall work&nbsp;with PSOs to receive patient safety and quality data and to render patient safety work product non-identifiable and compliant with requirements of the Patient Safety Rule (Section 3.212), then transferring the data securely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>Specific objectives of this contract are to:</p>
<p>1 Maintain PSOPPC operations<br />2 Develop and maintain PSO PPC website and databases for receipt, analysis, and development of non-identifiable data, archive, storage, and access to data by PSOs<br />3 Receive information on patient safety events from PSOs <br />4 Apply protocols for rendering patient safety events non-identifiable<br />5 Transfer non-identifiable information of patient safety events to the NPSD<br />6 Provide technical assistance to PSOs, including training<br />7 Coordinate and conduct the PSO Annual Meeting, AHRQ Common Formats Software Developer's Meeting and PSO Quarterly Conference Calls</p>
<p><br />The PSO PPC should be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as development of large scale analytic databases for patient safety and healthcare quality data; experience with development of standardized definitions, data elements and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting; and statistical analysis expertise in non-identification methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Regional Office intends to award an operation and maintenance (O&M) services purchase order to the Stutsman County Park Board for Jamestown Dam and Reservoir located near Jamestown, North Dakota in Stutsman County. The required services include the following tasks:
1.  General Dam Site Surveillance Inspections2.  Gate Changes3.  Vegetation Mowing4.  Miscellaneous Maintenance Activities5.  Noxious Weed Control
While Reclamation maintains the ultimate responsibility for the operation and maintenance of Jamestown Dam, the administration of the reservoir's recreation management programs has been delegated to the Stutsman County Park Board.  Therefore, Reclamation has found the Stutsman County Park Board to be the only source with local knowledge and experience necessary to successfully complete the required O&M services on an as-needed basis.
This procurement is being conducted pursuant to Part 12 and Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Since Reclamation believes that only one responsible source can fully provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared and approved by the Great Plains Regional Office Chief of Contracting.
The Government intends to award this requirement on or around March 21, 2012.  Vendors that recognize they can fully provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  In order to allow for sufficient Government consideration and potential quote evaluation, vendors shall submit their written Letter of Interest no later than March 13, 2012.  Responses received after March 13, 2012 may not be considered by the Government.
Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Bureau of Reclamation - GP-5000; 316 North 26th Street; Billings, Montana 59101, or faxed to 406-247-7798, Attn:  Christine Mundt, or e-mailed to cmundt@usbr.gov.  All responses should include the vendor's Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Vendors shall additionally identify themselves as either a "small business" or an "other than small business" under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561730.  The applicable Small Business Size Standard is $7.0 million.
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.
CCR:  Effective October 1, 2003, (FAR 4.1102) any contractor interested in doing business with the federal government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract or agreement.  Contractors may register at http://www.ccr.gov.

<p>Section K-(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications, https://orca.bpn.gov/. Delete: - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help. Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive, Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 , Tel. 703-872-8600 Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>All Offerors must acknowledgment all amendments if any. Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Ability to Meet Specification(s), Abiltity to meet delivery lead times, Past Performance, Enviromental and price. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. The solicitation will be available on Fedbizops at www.eps.gov on or about March 2, 2012. No copies of the solicitation will be mailed. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<p>Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment - TPE16-30</p>
<p>Agency: The National Transit Institute</p>
<p>Date for receipt of proposals: Friday, March 30, 2012</p>
<p>The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals from qualified professionals to facilitate its existing Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment course. In addition, NTI may request proposers to edit/update the existing course materials.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to present the Federal Transit Administration's procedures and methods for predicting and assessing noise and vibration impacts from proposed mass transit projects. The training modules in this three-day course closely follow the procedures contained in FTA's guidance on the subject (Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment, May 2006). The course gives an overview of the environmental review process and how noise and vibration assessment fits into FTA's planning and project development processes. Fundamentals of noise and vibration are discussed along with the specific metrics and impact criteria that are used in noise and vibration assessments. Different levels of analysis for noise and vibration are presented, along with considerations in choosing the appropriate level of analysis depending on the type of project and the stage of project development. The emphasis is on predicting impacts from operation of new transit systems; however, construction impacts are also covered. The course covers all the typical transit modes as well as multi-modal highway/transit projects. Various measures to mitigate excessive levels of transit noise and vibration are also discussed. A number of class exercises and case studies are brought in to reinforce the concepts, procedures, and practices introduced in the course. Ample time is allocated toward the end of the session to discuss attendees' questions and issues related to specific projects.</p>
<p>A copy of the complete Request for Proposal #1917 can be obtained at http://procure.rutgers.edu under the category "Active Bids".</p>
<p>The login: RFP1917 (case and space sensitive)<br />Password: BavQgKMJ (case and space sensitive)</p>
<p>Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small business, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned businesses. These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.<br /><br />
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC), 15 Centennial Drive, Peabody, MA  01960 for a STACIS iX 2-tier Active Vibration Isolation System.</p>
<p>The NINDS Synaptic Physiology Section studies the biophysics of synaptic transmission and the mechanisms by which neurons integrate synaptic information.  NINDS will examine synaptic inputs at the subcellular level, specifically in retinal amacrine cells.  These cells have been shown to process information locally, in small microcircuits distant from their soma.  Consequently, electrophysiological recordings from the soma are not sufficient for studying the behavior of these phenomena.  To explore signaling in these microcircuits, located along fine dendritic processes, it is critically important to combine high-resolution two-photon imaging and advanced electrophysiology techniques under conditions of maximal mechanical stability.  The acquisition of the TMC Stacis Active vibration isolation system will be critical for constructing an imaging/electrophysiology system that is free of mechanical vibrations.</p>
<p>Mechanical stability is paramount in physiological experiments, and the apparatus is mounding on a large vibration table.  The intrinsic vibration characteristics of Building 35 at NIH introduce significant difficulties with regard to achieving a vibration free environment required for the experiments. The TMC Stacis iX laser table base system will enhance NINDS's ability to perform these sensitive physiology and imaging experiments by dramatically reducing mechanical vibrations that can blur optical images.</p>
<p>The following characteristics apply to the required item:</p>
<p>(1) One (1) STACIS iX Laser Table Base Active Vibration Isolation System (TMC Model No. 25-38007-07) with Patented piezo-electric vibration isolation, digital controller, LCD user interface, with 2nd tier of passive isolation for optimized performance at 0.6-250 Hz, 4-8 dB isolation at 1 Hz, 10-20 dB isolation at 2 Hz, 25-40 dB isolation @ 4-100 Hz.</p>
<p>The STACIS Vibration Isolation system is a patented product sold and manufactured worldwide solely by TMC.  The STACIS iX Laser system incorporates patented Maxdamp passive and active isolators with patented STACIS technology and piezoelectric extended actuators.  This combination provides the most advanced vibration isolation system for extreme environments.  These environments are found in bldg 35 and this isolation is needed for laser imaging.  The STACIS system is the only commercially available vibration isolation system utilizing piezoelectric transducers to directly attenuate floor vibration resulting in a one of a kind actively controlled design.  <br />Program has the existing TMC clean top optical table and is in need of the STACIS iX Laser system to install under the table.  The TMC clean top optical table will only operate with the TMC STACIS iX Laser system.</p>
<p><br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., March 2, 2012 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2443476 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This Request for Quotations (RFQ) is for excavation, data recovery, and documentation of archeological site 45WH255 on Ross Lake during reservoir drawdown, approximately mid-April through late June 2012.  Archeological site 45WH255 is listed as a contributing property to the Upper Skagit River Valley Archeological District. It is located on a flat glacial terrace at ca. 1565 ft elevation and is described as a large, open, pre-contact period lithic scatter provisionally dated between 500 and 200 years old, based on two charcoal radiocarbon dates.  The site appears to have functioned as a short-term base camp or task-specific site. Contributing importantly to site significance are at least two (possibly three) circular fire-modified rock features that appear to have been used for heating, possibly for cooking food.  Annual exposure of the site to the erosive effects of reservoir shoreline processes may have altered site conditions since original field testing between 1988 and 1990.  The site is located relatively high in the reservoir and is partially protected from wave and wind erosion.  No pre-contact period human burials, gravesites, ceremonial features, or sacred objects have been recorded or reported in the project area in previous investigations.
The contractor shall employ standard methods for surface mapping of artifacts, site mapping, excavation of shovel or test probes, excavation of stratigraphy trenches and pits, and full-scale excavation using 1x1 and 2x2 m square excavation units, as needed to perform data recovery.   The contractor shall employ standard laboratory and analytic techniques to describe, identify, and classify archeological collections, as well as prepare an inventory of all artifacts recovered from excavation units, to include their provenience, class or artifact category, age assessment, and context (in situ or disturbed).  The contractor shall prepare a report describing laboratory methods, field methods, and their results, along with archeological interpretations of the data that address issues and objectives of the research design.  These requirements are described fully in the Statement of Work attached to the RFQ (solicitation).
LOCATION:  The project area is located within the drawdown zone at the southern end of Ross Lake near Ten Mile Island, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by the National Park Service.  It is comprised of the exposed and devegetated reservoir bottom lands ("drawdown zone"), where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air for a short time each year.  Directions to the site will be provided in the RFQ, but be advised there is no direct road or trail access to this site.  Information about Ross Lake may be found at http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/boating-and-fishing.htm
SITE VISIT:  Offerors are encouraged to participate in a site visit on Thursday, March 15, 2012.  The purpose of the visit will be to familiarize offerors with the site and the somewhat complicated logistics of getting there.  If you plan to attend, register by e-mail to the COR (bob_mierendorf@nps.gov) by 4:30 pm Monday, March 12.   The site visit will begin at the NPS Curation Building, 7245 Ranger Station Road, Marblemount WA, at 10:00 a.m. and will end there in the mid-afternoon.  Bring a lunch and dress appropriately for a variety of weather conditions.  
SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement reserved and set-aside for small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 541720 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million.  The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately March 1, 2012, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  Offers are due at 4:30 pm on April 2, 2012, or as noted on the final amendment.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services at the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, S.A.R. Local guard services are required to: prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; prevent destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. The Consulate requires a secure environment to conduct its mission. Duties will include, but are not be limited to, restricting entry of unauthorized personnel, the operation of walk-through and hand-held metal detectors, and the operation of electronic and hydraulic barriers. <br /><br />
<p>Each Contractor will be asked to provide fully burdened hourly rates for all labor categories (e.g., Guard, Senior Guard, and Supervisor). The fully burdened hourly rates for Standard Services as well as Additional or Emergency Services shall include all wages (local labor law compliance if applicable and any premiums relating to overtime, holidays, or night shifts), overhead, fringe benefits, severance costs, general and administrative expenses and profit for each category of labor.</p>
<p>Contractor performance will be monitored through a Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan. For specific deficiencies in performance, the U.S. Government may deduct the estimated cost for the Government to provide the service in the absence of a contract employee or the additional administrative time incurred by the Government in correcting the performance deficiency.<br />For certain deficiencies such as an unmanned position, the negative incentive for not meeting the Performance Standard is a deduction in the billing amount at the Government's estimate cost for providing the required service not to exceed the length of the guard shift.</p>
<p>Some of the major tasks required of the Contractor are Entry Control (i.e., Office Building Entry Control, Official Residential Entry Control, Vehicle Entry and Access Control), Inspections, Use of Explosive and/or X-Ray Inspection Equipment, Patrols, Escort Services, Completion of Logs and Records, Operation of Closed Circuit Televisions, Use of a Guard Electronic Monitoring System, Operation of a Radio Network, and Implementation of a Contingency Plan capable of dealing with strikes and labor unrest should either occur.</p>
<p>The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services. The Government plans to award one contract. The anticipated period of performance is for one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. Additionally, all guards shall successfully complete an approved training program of instruction before being allowed to perform guard services. The basic training program shall consist of 80 hours of training and this requirement does not apply to guards who have previously successfully completed the training.</p>
<p>Guard/key personnel positions require a minimum Level 1 English language proficiency, which requires the ability to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics. Certain positions require up to a Level 3 proficiency in English.<br /><br />The Government plans to issue the solicitation 15 days after the issuance of this synopsis, on the FedBizOpps site through addition to this synopsis. No paper copies will be mailed. All announcements and amendments made to this solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps; to receive updates, click the link for "Watch This Opportunity."<br /><br />The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days and then the solicitation will be released and will remain open for sixty (60) days. The Question and Answer period begins when the solicitation is released and will end approximately four (4) weeks prior to the close of the solicitation. Proposals must be received by close of the sixty (60) day solicitation period; award will be made approximately sixty (60) days after proposal submission. All dates are subject to change; Offerors will be notified by amendment to the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>A site visit at the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, S.A.R., is tentatively scheduled for twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens; a firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Hong Kong. Due to space limitations, only two representatives from each firm will be allowed to attend the site visit. Do not contact Consulate officials or personnel regarding any element of the solicitation, including the site visit. All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. No questions concerning this requirement will be answered until the solicitation is posted.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) on or about 30 March 2012, to the Institute for the Future. The period of performance will be approximately April 1, 2012 through 30 September 2012. <br />The prospective contractor shall provide support in re-purposing the Massive Multiplayer Online War Game Leveraging the Internet (MMOWGLI) to be conducted between April 1, 2012 and May 30, 2012. The vendor shall provide support in the areas of pre-game planning, scenario development and production, pre-game player engagement and outreach, in-game facilitation and, post-game support.<br /><br />ONR intends to award this requirement as a sole source to the Institute for the Future (IFTF) since prior conduct of a formal open industry-wide competition and subsequent evaluation of proposals has indicated that there are no other sources with the ability to successfully provide the required services. Further, whereas based upon its participation in the initial MMOWGLI, conducted during GFY10 -11, IFTF has developed unique qualifications that would create a duplication of effort, and thus create significant additional costs, if awarded to another vendor.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611 with the size standard of $7 million in average annual receipts. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation and technical capabilities, which, if received within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by ONR. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research (ONR), Code - ONR BD254, 875 North Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203-1995.

<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. In addition, any offered space must be ready for occupancy no later than September 1, 2013</p>

Description of work to be performed includes design work for the preparation of 100% complete working drawings, specifications, and cost estimates as required to renovate and expand existing space in Building 2 on the VA Medical Center campus, Salisbury, NC.  The renovations shall be designed with coordination with all VA staff input for various program areas that have impact in this building.   VA space criteria shall be used as a guide with standards implemented into the plans.   Work to also include all associated site work, landscaping, road work and other related work as required integrating the renovated space and new structure completely into the campus.

The objective of this project is to renovate space currently occupied by Surgical Service administrative offices and create a new 8 bed combined Medical & Surgical Intensive Care Unit on the 4th floor of Building 2.   Building 2 is 1950's construction and the newly renovated space is planned to create improved patient flow with the adjacent Surgery Operatories and PACU.  Additionally, the project will create separate preoperative preparation and holding areas to facilitate the proper prepping of patients' pre-surgical intervention as well as space for the surgical service admin offices.  The space currently occupied by the ICU on the Third Floor of Building 2 will be used to create support spaces for the inpatient Medical-Surgical unit.  The project will renovate approximately 22,061 SF of existing space on the third and fourth floors of Building 2.  The project will also construct a new building addition of approximately 2,000 SF on the back side of Building 2 to support the expansion of the existing SPD department which is vastly undersized and will need to be expanded to handle the additional bed and service capacity expansions.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing AFGLSC/401 SCMS or its successor organization(s). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet.
<p>The scope of AFGLSC's enterprise-wide responsibilities includes analyzing, operating, maintaining, and enhancing COLT, PDL, RBL, support equip. systems, ASM, RMS, EXPRESS, and HVM. Because of the highly technical nature of the above mentioned systems, AFGLSC needs contractor support to provide the specialized analytical skills necessary to operate, maintain, and enhance COLT and integrate it into the AFGLSC's enterprise-level processes. The Air Force installations where service will be provided may require contractor personnel to travel to these locations.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates the period of performance will be approximately 1 year, beginning in CY12. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time.

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR CAPABILITY STATEMENT FOR THIS REQUEST <br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Statement of Work</strong></span></p>
<p>TITLE: Rapid Assessment of forward and reverse cold chain systems for polio eradication and AFP surveillance</p>
<p><br />I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Since 1991, CDC has provided substantial financial and technical support for polio eradication and measles elimination, and is one of the founding partners of the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI). In 2010, CDC invested $153 million in global immunization. Given this significant financial commitment to immunization programs worldwide, protecting vaccine during storage and transport is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>A critical element of any immunization program is its cold chain system (a web of storage and transport links). As vaccines are sensitive to extremes of both heat and cold, they must be maintained within strict temperature parameters to retain their efficacy. As vaccines and diluents pass through a transport chain from manufacturer to end-user, there are storage needs at each step, involving appropriate temperature, humidity and light parameters; thus, preservation of cold chain requires energy to create and maintain temperature as well as thermally-efficient packaging to protect and transport the vaccine.</p>
<p>The CDC and WHO, along with experts from the pharmaceutical industry and public health organizations, have established guidelines for the storage and handling of vaccines specific to field conditions . Cold chain systems can fail as a function of human error, logistical breakdowns, or equipment misuse or underperformance. These failures result in costly vaccine loss, and if undetected, the administration of compromised vaccine.</p>
<p>Temperature stability is also a critical consideration for the transport of laboratory specimens, medicines, blood, reagents, and diagnostic test kits used in public health and medicine, because freeze-thaw cycles and heat exposure can affect the viability of many temperature-sensitive products. For diseases such as polio, where case confirmation is dependent upon viral isolation in fecal specimens, a well-functioning reverse cold chain system is critical. Breaks in reverse cold chain-- the temperature-sensitive transport chain from the field back to a laboratory setting--can lead to missed cases, inaccurate surveillance and continued transmission of disease. In the case of polio, which is slated for eradication, controlled temperature is imperative for case confirmation.<br /><br />The effort to eradicate polioviruses from Nigeria is at a critical crossroads. There is now a time-limited opportunity to improve the quality of activities sufficiently to interrupt the final chains of wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus circulation before the accumulation of susceptible children results in major new outbreaks that would undermine the strong prospects for imminent success.</p>
<p>This activity will comprise two key activities:</p>
<p>1) A rapid assessment of the forward cold chain system used to transport and store polio and "routine" vaccines ;<br />2) A rapid assessment of the reverse cold chain system used for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance;</p>
<p>This activity would be carried out in collaboration with technical staff from NPHCDA, World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and CDC, who will provide additional logistical and field support to the activity.</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE</p>
<p>1. To provide technical support in the conduct of a program evaluation of the forward vaccine cold chain for its precision and effectiveness in maintaining target temperatures for polio and other routine antigens in select states and LGAs.</p>
<p>2. To provide technical support in the conduct of a program evaluation of the reverse cold chain used for AFP surveillance in support of polio eradication activities. The assessment will also include analysis of specimen receipt and handling metrics at the national reference lab in Ibadan.<br />III . SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The vendor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below.</p>
<p>III. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>Phase I Forward Cold Chain</p>
<p>1. Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) to measure vaccine temperature during storage and transport phases of the cold chain<br />2. Design and develop data collection instruments <br />a. Vendor will design data collection instruments for tracking of temperature monitoring equipment <br />b. Vendor will design procedures to assess and/or document packing processes that impact cargo integrity<br />c. Vendor will evaluate other process barriers impacting cold chain system effectiveness.<br />3. Design and develop management information system to facilitate the collection, organization, management and analysis of study data. The system must have the capacity to manage relational data and provide appropriate analysis-ready data files as required by study investigators.<br />4. Vendor will conduct pre-testing data collection forms, and data collection processes in the field.<br />5. Vendor will develop written and visual training materials for local participants and supervisors; this includes relevant PowerPoint educational materials, printed handouts for training sessions, and practical exercises to assess comprehension of training materials.<br />6. Vendor will facilitate training workshops for data collectors as required, including co-instruction<br />7. Vendor will facilitate post-evaluation de-briefing/trainings for participants and other principles.<br />8. Vendor will liaise with local staff to implement the activity, including CDC-associated, NPHCDA, WHO and UNICEF staff.<br />9. Vendor will be responsible for procuring a training site, including requisite meals for trainings.<br />10. Vendor will be responsible for procuring translators, security and drivers as necessary.<br />Phase II Reverse Cold Chain</p>
<p>There are three discrete metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of a reverse cold chain system for stool specimens:</p>
<p>&#61600; The percent of specimens arriving at national laboratory within &lt;3 days of being sent &ge;80%; <br />&#61600; Proportion of specimens with a turnaround time of 28 days between receipt and reporting of results &ge;80%; and <br />&#61600; Proportion of stool specimens arrive at laboratory in good condition &ge;80%. "Good condition" operationalized on arrival as: <br />(1) there are frozen icepacks (or other refrigerant) or a temperature indicator (showing &lt;8 &deg;C) in the container<br />(2) the specimen volume is adequate (&gt;5 g)<br />(3) there is no evidence of leakage or desiccation, and <br />(4) appropriate documentation (laboratory request/reporting form) is completed.<br />This activity will focus on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of these metrics. <br />1. Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) to measure specimen temperature from collection in field from AFP case, through delivery at appropriate reference lab<br />2. Design and develop data collection instruments <br />a. Vendor will to design data collection instruments for tracking of temperature monitoring equipment <br />b.

<p>Response Due Date: April 2, 2012</p>
<p>E-mail: <br />Correspond directly with Contract Specialist Kristopher Lemaster at KLemaster@cdc.gov. <br />Questions submitted by a method other than electronic mail will not be accepted or acknowledged.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your e-mail response has "XYZZY-2012-RFI-NHANES" in the subject line. <br />Any responses received after the specified deadline date and time will not be accepted or acknowledged.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />Background: <br />The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for<br />the Nation. NHANES is a congressionally mandated research project to determine the health and nutritional status of people living in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. Well known products of the NHANES survey include the pediatric growth charts and the obesity statistic.</p>
<p>The NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in randomly selected counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year. Data is collected in household interviews and in federally owned mobile examination centers (MECs). Data is collected in two-year cycles.</p>
<p>The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related<br />questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, physiological measurements and laboratory tests from a blood draw and urine collection.</p>
<p>Findings from this survey will be used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and<br />risk factors for diseases. Information will be used to assess nutritional status and its association<br />with health promotion and disease prevention. NHANES findings are also the basis for national standards for such measurements as height, weight, and blood pressure. Data from this survey will be used in epidemiological studies and health sciences research, which help develop sound public health policy, direct and design health programs and services, and expand the health knowledge for the Nation.</p>
<p>More information can be found on the NHANES web site: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm as well as the NCHS web site: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The office of the Deputy Chief Information Officer for Operations, in conjunction with the Video Program Office (VPO), is currently evaluating various technologies and solutions to best determine the future of Video Teleconferencing (VTC ) in the Department of State. The current VPO infrastructure consists of a Cisco/Tandberg Multi-point Control Unit (MCU), also referred to as a bridge, and Cisco/Tandberg Video Communications Servers (VCS). These are managed by the Cisco Telepresence Management Suite (TMS). Individual conference rooms and desktop units (end-points) make up the user-end of the infrastructure. This infrastructure allows for point-to-point and multi-point conferencing within the Department of State's private network, as well as conferencing to outside entities (i.e. other agencies, educational, and medical institutions, etc.) using the public Internet and ISDN. However, the existing infrastructure does not address mobile and desktop functionality; these will need to be addressed either with additional Cisco/Tandberg hardware/software, or by augmenting the existing infrastructure with 3rd party hardware/software. Information Security will be paramount and will need to be addressed throughout the project.<br /><br />See Request for Information (Attached)

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">The USAID Mission for Kosovo (USAID/Kosovo), located in Pristina, manages one of the most important and complex assistance programs in the region. &nbsp;In line with USG and Kosovo priorities, USAID/Kosovo's five-year strategic plan envisages Kosovo as an effective state, with a viable economy and an inclusive democracy on the path to European integration.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">Given the enormous and varied needs in Kosovo, USAID's programs focus on: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">The private sector as the engine of growth, and on civil society as the means for enhanced government accountability. USAID assistance until recently was focused on support for the basic building blocks of an independent Kosovo. For Kosovo to move forward, it needs to establish a clear economic base for development and to consolidate democratic achievements. Consequently, USAID assistance is supporting the private sector, which is best-positioned to determine Kosovo's comparative advantages and best able to increase incomes and jobs. With basic government functions operating with a degree of effectiveness, it is important to ensure that there is a vibrant civil society that is capable of holding the government accountable and demanding rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">Increased focus on assistance at the municipal level. Kosovo's central government institutions have achieved remarkable progress in a short period of time. While threats to these gains still remain, the focus now should be on building the capabilities of local government. Kosovo is implementing an ambitious decentralization program with substantial devolution of authorities and responsibilities to municipalities. Most municipalities are not prepared to deliver essential services and require strategic, cohesive assistance. It is also important to establish income and jobs base at the municipal level. These issues are even more urgent in the newly established municipalities and those with predominantly minority populations. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">At the center, focus is shifting from establishing institutions to making them functional. Central government institutions still require support to varying degrees of involvement. Over the next five years, the task will be to consolidate and build on successes at the center, and begin to scale back support to those ministries and agencies that are capable of successfully fulfilling their mandate without full-time donor assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">Support for youth and education is a major new area. Youth-oriented programs play a central role in USAID's portfolio. Youth and education interventions are cross-cutting and based on a strong partnership with the GoK and other stakeholders. <br /><br />The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders. <br /><br />A key element of USAID's approach is strong synergies throughout the portfolio to maximize impact - such as the coordination between programs to improve the business environment; to institute better contract enforcement and alternative dispute resolution methods in the rule of law sector; and to offer integrated economic growth and governance support programs in municipalities. &nbsp;<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">Kosovo is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a GDP per capita of around $3,000 with income levels close to two-thirds of other countries in the Western Balkans. Poverty remains widespread but has been declining - according to the latest available data (from 2009), 34 percent of the population is living below the national poverty line, and an estimated 12&nbsp;percentage extremely poor. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">Kosovo's economic growth has been steady since the end of the conflict in June 1999, attributable in part to large public investments in post-conflict reconstruction as well as an increase in private consumption and investment. Over the past few years Kosovo's economy has shown significant progress in transitioning to a market-based system and maintaining macroeconomic stability, but it is still dependent on the international community and the diaspora for financial and technical assistance. Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity. A limited and unreliable electricity supply due to technical and financial problems is a major impediment to economic development, but Kosovo has received technical assistance to help improve accounting and controls. Privatization of the distribution and supply divisions of Kosovo Energy Corporation is also planned. The official currency of Kosovo is the Euro. Kosovo's tie to the Euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo has one of the most open economies in the region, and continues to work with the international community on measures to improve </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">the business environment and attract foreign investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">The global economic crisis has had a significant impact on the European economy, including the countries comprising the Balkans. &nbsp;Due to the nature of Kosovo's small economy, the resilience of the diaspora remittances, and the fiscal stimulus provided by the public budget's capital spending, Kosovo managed to minimize the impact of the global crisis, with GDP growth exceeding 5% in 2011. The growth in public revenue exceeded 18% in 2011, surpassing the growth in the economy by boosting taxpayer compliance. The Government of Kosovo has prepared its 2012 budget in compliance with IMF recommendations, in anticipation of resumption of their Standby Agreement (SBA). &nbsp;The Government has so far resisted the pressures from powerful interest groups, maintaining reasonable fiscal discipline and financial stability, although long neglected infrastructure, education, and health care will continue to place enormous burden on public resources.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black">USAID has been the key donor in establishing economic institutions and systems in Kosovo. The key institutions, laws, and regulations are generally in place, as is a sound fiscal and financial system. Among the institutions supported by USAID technical assistance were the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK), the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK), the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), the Kosovo Pension Savings Trust (KPST), Kosovo Electric Company (Korporata Elektroenergjetike e Kosov&euml;s - KEK), Energy Regulatory Office (ERO), Kosovo Veterinary and Food Agency (KVFA), Kosovo Forest Agency (KFA) and others. Much progress has been made in building their capacity. Several, such as the CBK, the KPST, and the privatization agency, now function at a level of proficiency that does not require ongoing donor support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as identified in FAR 15.201(c)(7). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issues at this time, and this notice shall be not be considered as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting information (only) from national training vendors that provide real estate financial skills training, both in-class and online. This inquiry is being issued solely for planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a statement of work (SOW) or a commitment to issue a SOW in the future.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong></span>GSA's Public Buildings Service, Office of Organizational Resources, is interested in providing national training in order to increase the base knowledge of fundamental real estate principles within our existing workforce and provide the opportunity for our employees to interact and learn alongside private sector real estate professionals.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REQUIREMENT<br /></strong></span>An off-the-shelf real estate investment and finance course for approximately 1,000 PBS employees. <br />GSA anticipates the course curriculum will cover, but is not limited to:</p>

<p>&bull;Learn to take charge of real estate investments in order to maximize the value of a property.</p>
<p>&bull;Learn the income capitalization approach and cover property taxation costs and strategies to offset these costs.</p>
<p>&bull;Skills to conduct discounted cash flow analyses and calculate net present value and internal rate of return.</p>

<p>2. Where will the in-class (REFS) training take place (geographic areas)? Please list all cities, not just limited to the major cities provided.</p>
<p>3. How long is the in-class (REFS) training?</p>
<p>4. How many weeks does it take to complete the on-line (REFS) training? How many times a year is it offered?</p>
<p>5. Of your currently scheduled, public (REFS) course offerings, what percentage of each course, in-class and online, is filled with private sector real estate professionals? (i.e. 15%, 80%, 100% and registration is closed). Please provide for all scheduled courses.</p>
<p>6. How many private sector real estate professionals, on average, attend the (REFS) training each year, in class and online?</p>
<p>7. Are you on the GSA schedule?</p>
<p>8. What previous experience have you had working with the Government, if any, on a national training contract? Please provide a brief synopsis of all previous experience.</p>
<p>9. What is the price of an individual to attend (REFS) training, on-line and in-class?</p>
<p>10. Do you offer a government discount? Do you offer group discounts?</p>
<p><br />Our proposal for how to accomplish:</p>
<p>GSA purchases 1,000 "seats" (classroom spots). We will split the seats over all successful bidders (3-4 vendors). The purchase upfront of 1,000 seats will guarantee us 1,000 vouchers that are good to use through 2013. We can register our employees as the classes become available. The successful bidders would need to guarantee that enough public courses are offered over the length of the contract to accommodate the amount of vouchers allocated to them.</p>
<p>11. Can the market support this approach? Why or why not?</p>
<p>12. And if not, how would your company recommend the government accomplish our need to train 1000 employees on real estate financial skills, over the course of 1-2 years, utilizing publicly scheduled course offerings, in order for our employees to learn alongside and interact with the private sector?</p>
<p>Please provide your recommended approach and include the core curriculum/syllabus of the anticipated course offering.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Research, Development and Acquisition Center (SORDAC), on behalf of the warfighter, seeks information from industry for a Medium Range Precision Strike System (MRPSS).The weapons system should provide the capability for precision engagements by U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) users against enemy forces. The entire system is to be portable on a light, commercially available truck. Thus the entire system must weigh no more than 900 pounds and not exceed a dimension of 76"X86"X200" including all cables, power sources, fire control and any other required accessories.<br /><br />The system is required to be used both day and night, in all weather conditions in order to engage enemy personnel in the open, light structures, and vehicles. The enemy vehicles could be stationary or moving commercial SUVs, pick-ups, or sedans. The system, at a minimum, should include a Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) and Semi-Active Laser (SAL) terminal homing guidance system. <br /><br />It is desirable to have additional guidance modes such as, but not limited to, millimeter wave radar, synthetic aperture radar, imaging infrared or Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). It is highly desirable for the system to be capable of static or moving employment (from friendly vehicles on the move).

Technical Evaluation
A subjective evaluation of the offeror's technical proposal - descriptive literature and performance specifications will be performed. The descriptive literature and performance specifications will be evaluated to determine whether the offered products meet the minimum technical requirements. Offers that have submitted sufficient evidence that the offered products met the minimum technical requirements will be evaluated for possible award. Offers that fail to submit sufficient evidence that the offered products met the minimum technical requirements will receive no further consideration. Not meeting any aspect of the minimum technical requirement will cause rejection of the offer for that line item. The Government may consider all aspects of the product, including but not limited to the evaluation factors listed below.  The VA's intent is to evaluate each patient lift with the associated slings. 
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are listed in descending order of importance with performance and ease of use equal in value.  The non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than Price. 

Overall Factors: Technical - Past Performance - Socioeconomic Consideration


Evaluation Factors  

	Quality:  Including but not limited to materials utilization, fabrication quality, and mechanisms for required adjustability. Battery Life - Provide documentation regarding number of lifts per battery charge for electric lifts (product literature/documentation from their battery supplier/manufacturer/battery life on company letterhead).

	Performance: Including but not limited to stability, maneuverability and durability.

	Ease of Use: Including but not limited to ergonomic design as related to operation/adjustment/maintenance of all features in varied environments of intended use. 

	Warranty: The extent to which the provided warranty exceeds the minimum requirement required (one-year coverage of parts, labor and all associated costs.)

Safety

      The technical panel will subjectively evaluate all features and functions of the offered Patient Lift & Slings for safety.  This will not be a rated factor e.g. Patient Lift & Slings will not be judged as "safer" than a different Lift & Sling. Rather this is a threshold factor and failure to meet this factor will result in the offer being rejected and not further evaluated.  At any time during the evaluation if the panel finds any feature or aspect of the Lift & Slings to represent a safety hazard for our Veteran population then the Lift & Slings will be rejected.

Delivery Requirements:   
Delivery shall be made to any VAMC within the United States and Puerto Rico upon issuance of a delivery order.  Delivery shall be in accordance with the following time frames:  Regular delivery shall be made within fourteen (14) days after receipt of a delivery/purchase order, expedited delivery shall be within three (3) days, and emergency delivery shall be within twenty four (24) hours.  The Government agrees to pay the difference between normal and expedited freight for expedited and emergency delivery.  Any additional delivery requirements shall be specified on the individual VAMC delivery order.

Background:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) previously procured 2000 perpetual eGain KnowledgeAgent licenses and 150,000 web portal sessions per month in March 2011.  To expand the user base to more VA facilities, it was determined that additional licenses and web portal session per month are needed.  eGain KnowledgeAgent is currently installed and in production at VA's Austin Information Technology Center in support of the Veterans Relationship Management (VRM) Program Enterprise Knowledge Management (KM) Solution.  KnowledgeAgent provides easy access to VA knowledge designated for external use while internal users have easy access to internal VA knowledge appropriate to their authenticated identity and role.  Current users are able to propose content that will be vetted to be later accessed and used as knowledge.  KnowledgeAgent empowers users with the capability to perform searches on the KM content.  Internal users have the capability to generate reports and manage KM operations. 
Requested Information:
VA is seeking qualified vendors capable of meeting VA's requirement for 667 additional concurrent eGain KnowledgeAgent software or equal licenses and 350,000 portal sessions; software maintenance and technical support; functionality training services for both Administrative and User; and consulting service to assist with on boarding new user groups and assisting with problem resolution.  If equal brand name software is proposed, the solution must integrate with VA's KM solution and all existing interfaces currently working with the eGain KnowledgeAgent brand name software and meeting the requirements listed below. VA is also seeking information related to the hosting of these eGain licenses in a outsourced or cloud environment. Such environment would support disaster recovery, helpdesk support and the provisioning of a small development environment for future enhancement proof of concepts activities.  This environment should be able to support 24 x 7 assistance.


Required Software shall include the following features: 
1.	Search methods
"	Keyword and intent-based search 
"	Natural language search 
"	Topic tree browsing 
"	Guided help, powered by patented Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) 
"	Content federation: Federated search across web site, contact center, enterprise, community and social content 
"	All access methods behind single search box
2.	Search navigation 
"	Relevance-ranked presentation of search results 
"	Keyword matching to metadata for concept or intent-based search, rather than plain keyword search 
"	Best practice guided help for process-centric searches, optimized for contact center agents and customer experience 
"	Ability to hop across search methods to find the answer (for instance, from topic-tree browsing to guided help)
The period of performance is anticipated to be a 12-month base period from time of contract award with two (2) twelve (12) month options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.   
The Government is open to considering teaming and prime/subcontractor relationships for this effort.  If interested, please submit a Capabilities Statement, limited to ten (10) pages for your company, your teammates and or subcontractors and also denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541519.

Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-01-383-7799	<br />Name:		Roller Mop, Industrial Steel, 12" Head<br />Description:	12" steel roller mop with replaceable/refillable snap-on cellulose mop head. Features an ergonomic, high-handle mounted lever that operates the head rollers and enables mess-free wringing; snap-on cellulose head and finished steel handle designed to withstand heavy industrial usage. UoI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-01-383-7927<br />Name:		Refill, Sponge Head<br />Description:	12" yellow cellulose sponge mop head with black metal bracket designed for the industrial steel mop. Designed to absorb liquids fast and rinse quickly and easily. Durable black metal bracket facilitates for heavy commercial and industrial usage. Refill is used on mop 7920-01-383-7799. UoI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-01-383-7799	<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p>NSN:		7920-01-383-7927<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 12, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: A new technique developed by NASA enables the preparation of metal/composite hybridlaminates, also known as fiber metal laminates (FML), by depositing metal directly ontofabric using a plasma deposition process. FMLs provide a useful combination of structuraland functional properties for both aerospace and non-aerospace applications. Currently,FMLs are prepared in a compression process utilizing a press or autoclave with metalliclayers (foils) sandwiched between layers of glass or graphite prepreg (preimpregnatedfibers with a matrix resin). The NASA process deposits the metal on the fiber via plasmadeposition. Theporosity of the coated fabric allows for resin infusion.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Atmospheric Systems Corporation (ASC) of Santa Clarita, California for the purchase of a Sonic Detection &amp; Ranging (SoDar) Instrument under other than full and open competition.<br />&nbsp;<br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The ASC SoDar instrument will be used in conjunction with an existing ASC SoDar system already purchased by NIST. NIST requires an identical SoDar as to the one currently at NIST; so that it will allow identical collection of data under all operating conditions. Deviations away from the ASC SoDar would cause analysis compatibility issues and would result in significant duplication of cost to NIST in man-hours. Atmospheric Systems Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system. As a result, Atmospheric Systems Corporation is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334519, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 9, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 AND FAR SUBPART 5.705.
<p>Contract Number SB1341-11-CN-0011 was awarded to Wiklund Research and Design of Concord, MA, on February 28, 2011, in the amount of $1,206,648.00. All work was required to be completed not later than February 27, 2012.</p>
<p>Work required under this contract shall provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary to develop Usability Guidelines and an Evaluation Framework for Electronic Health Records Systems.</p>
<p>The above referenced work is being completed under a time and materials contract. Due to multiple unknowns associated with the project, a firm fixed price could not be established with any reasonable degree of confidence. Unknowns include: uncertainty regarding the frequency and location of meetings that the Contractor will require to complete the required work; uncertainty with respect to the number of Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs) available and being utilized in the professional marketplace; and use of a firm fixed price contract was anticipated to limit competition and increase the cost to the Government due to a significant amount of risk.</p>
<p>Modification 002 is being issued to extend the period of performance and completion dates for deliverables. The extension is required due to Government delays associated with a post-award protest as well as Institutional Review Board and Paperwork Reduction Act approvals required prior to the start of the research protocols. The period of performance has been extended through <br />December 31, 2012. Due dates for deliverables are being modified accordingly.</p>
<p>The total amount of the contract remains unchanged.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with NanoComposix, 4878 Ronson Court, STE K, San Diego, CA 92111. NanoComposix is the only reseller of the needed Silver Nanoparticles. A firm-fixed price purchase order award is anticipated. The authority to negotiate on a sole source basis is FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1). A Sources Sought notice for this requirement was posted on February 7, 2012 and closed on February 17, 2012.</p>
<p>The Ceramics Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing two silver nanoparticle reference materials, of 10 nm diameter and 75 nm diameter. This reference material must be aligned with international demands and expectations for quality of reference materials for silver nanoparticle standards, such as the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) testing programme's Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN). Producing high quality silver nanoparticles suitable for reference materials is a challenging task. The company must be able to provide a product that meets the following technical specifications.</p>
<p>Product Specifications:<br />&bull; Products must be manufactured by a U.S. vendor that has routinely demonstrated manufacturing silver nanoparticles that meet or exceed requirements for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN) common test materials for silver nanoparticles.<br />&bull; Product #1, Nominal 10 nm diameter, Product #2, Nominal 75 nm diameter, diameter measurements based primarily on silver core diameter by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Particles should be spherical in shape.<br />&bull; 6 L of 10 nm, 6 L of 75 nm, at 1.0 mg / mL (within +/- 10%) total silver content; minimum of 6.00 g silver in total per diameter, 12.00 g silver total order.<br />&bull; The mean TEM diameter of the silver core of the "10nm" particles must fall within the range of 8.0 nm to 12.0 nm, and the mean TEM diameter of the silver core of the "75nm" particles must fall within the range of 70.0 nm to 80.0 nm.<br />&bull; Have a C.V. less than +/- 20% for 10nm, and +/- 20% for 75nm (where C.V. is defined as one standard deviation of the mean of all NPs sized by TEM divided by the mean size), based on N&gt;1000 for entire batch, or N&gt;200 per smaller batch.<br />&bull; Product should have a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capping agent. <br />&bull; Excess synthesis reagents should be removed (for example, reducing agents, unreduced metal salts, intermediate capping agents), such that the purity of the product meets or exceeds OECD common test material purities. <br />&bull; An additional PVP content of 4 wt% should be added to the suspension. PVP should be of an approximately 10 kDa molecular mass (MW). <br />&bull; Particle cores must contain all silver. If seed-mediated methods are to be used, only silver seeds may be used; no gold, other metal, polymer, or any other material may be used as seeds.<br />&bull; Precursor material selection and process engineering should provide endotoxin levels in the final product to be less than 2.5 endotoxin units (EU)/mL.<br />&bull; Provide "testing aliquots" from (each) batch, containing no less than 20 mL, shipped overnight to NIST for testing and verification that using NIST's equipment aliquots can be freeze-dried into a powder, then resuspended by adding 5 mL of deionized water and waiting 1 hour, and recover all material into a monodisperse suspension as originally provided as measured by reproducing the absorbance spectrum (UV-vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS) intensity-based size distribution, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). If signs of agglomeration are present, the formulation request may be subtly modified at this point before shipping (such as adding additional PVP).<br />&bull; The materials should be able to kept in the dark and refrigerated whenever stored. The materials may be exposed to normal laboratory light during normal production, processing, and handling.<br />&bull; Quality assurance on each product should be performed and provided, including:<br />o TEM diameters, following NIST - Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL) protocol number PCC-7, and performing TEM measurements within 24 hours of particle deposition onto substrates. (http://ncl.cancer.gov/working_assay-cascade.asp) No less than 1,000 nanoparticles should be sized, with number-based size distribution histograms provided in addition to no less than 10 representative TEM images of the nanoparticles used for sizing analysis.<br />o DLS Z-average size and intensity-based size distribution, following NIST-NCL protocol PCC-1.<br />o Total silver content measurement by chemical analysis, for example by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).<br />o Endotoxin test results, following appropriate NIST-NCL protocols. Additionally, data provided should include calibration curves with several concentrations of endotoxin positive controls only, silver nanoparticle solutions only, and several concentrations of endotoxin positive controls added to silver nanoparticle solutions; this will assure there is no false-positive or false-negative results due to the nanoparticles potential interference in the assay.<br />o Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy absorbance spectra.<br />o All quality assurance methods and materials should be provided with the data.<br />&bull; Packaging &amp; Shipping:<br />o The materials should be packaged in sterile containers and sealed.<br />o All materials must be able to arrive "fresh." Specifically, all the materials for a given product must arrive at NIST no later than three weeks from the commencement of the first reduction of silver atoms in the first batch ("start" of synthesis). "Testing aliquots" should be sent by overnight delivery to NIST no later than 8 calendar days after the start of synthesis (received by NIST no later than 9 calendar days after the start of synthesis), in order for NIST to verify acceptable freeze-drying performance. <br />o Shipment should include proof temperatures did not exceed 45 &#7506;C, or drop below 2 &#7506;C.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)</p>
<p>Companies should include in their response their plans for achieving each of the following specifications. Please include the company's size classification in any response to this notice. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort.</p>
<p>All documents must be sent to Micole Cheatham, contract specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. Email address: micole.cheatham@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to acquire access to a best-practice research library under an enterprise subscription from the private and public sector, diagnostic tools designed to support our information collaboration and delivery environment, supplemental guidance on the business impacts of implementing different IT strategies, benchmarking data, training material, and moderated networking opportunities focused on Applications Strategy and Management.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to the Corporate Executive Board, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, kvultaggio@usgs.gov no later than 2:00 PM EST, Thursday March 8, 2012 with an affirmative answer.   
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained. SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
Corporate Executive Board (CEB) - Collaborative Research, best practices, benchmarking, tools, templates and diagnostics.  Focus is on cross-functional business issues in the IT sector.  CEB also offers the following unique diagnostic tools required by the Government to provide leverage, so that enterprise initiatives may be accomplished with existing staff.
o	Anatomy of World-Class Solutions Delivery: The Anatomy of World-Class Solutions Delivery measures the importance and maturity of 23 new or evolving competencies. The Council has an all new diagnostic which defines capabilities at each level of maturity based on the practical experiences of Applications groups.o	Insight IQ Diagnostic: The Insight IQ Diagnostic benchmarks the organization's information management practices and knowledge worker analytic capabilities and helps to prioritize areas for improvement. The diagnostic builds on a rich dataset that spans a variety of organization sizes and industries, and includes responses from more than 6,000 knowledge workers globally. o	Enterprise Architect Effectiveness Diagnostic: (Jan 30-March 9) The skills demanded of Enterprise Architects are changing and few Chief Architects know whether they have the right mix across their teams to meet this demand. This diagnostic provides a clear assessment of the USGS team's skills and domain expertise. The results will allow the Government to compare the team's perception of their effectiveness with that of the Chief Architect and to a benchmark of peers.Also, as required by the Government, CEB subscription also offers Anatomy of a World-Class Enterprise Architecture Group: The Anatomy of a World-Class Enterprise Architecture Group measures the importance, ownership, and maturity of 15 critical and emerging EA activities. The Library of Congress uses this vendor as a part of their FEDLINK program, which is a pre-vetted listing of vendors with whom other government agencies can procure services via special Interagency Agreements (IAs) for a fee.  The FEDLINK program designates the CEB as a Sole Source IDIQ because there are no other vendors providing the same services.  Information on the FEDLINK program can be found at: http://www.loc.gov/flicc/.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 30 March 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Item 0001 
ASPHALT MIXTURE
Quantity: 200 Tons
Requirements for Asphalt:

1.	Asphalt is to be of a  mixture suitable to sustain moderate traffic loads such as access roads, driveways and parking lots. A Generic C2 mix design is allowable.
2.	Asphalt mix shall use AR4000/PG6410 oil in the mix and or equivalent.  Vender must be aware that the asphalt is for a training environment and if a grade of oil used is not of the type listed it must not have a faster set/harden time then the oil listed above.
  These Oils are also the same oils currently in use for Asphalt Projects aboard Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC).  
3.	Recycled Asphalt Product (RAP) as part of the mix design in a quantity not to exceed 10% of the total mix design is allowable.  
4.	Vender is to provide or arrange as part of the contract the transportation of the Hot Mix Asphalt to NBVC.
5.	Delivery of Hot Mix Asphalt is a time critical venture, a vendor must be chosen locally as to ensure the Asphalt does not cool down below 280* degrees Fahrenheit when received on the job site.
6.	Upon Delivery Instructors, test the temperature and quality of the Asphalt.  If Asphalt is not within the desired temperature range as stated vendor or vendor arranged delivery truck must depart with the Asphalt mix not meeting specifications.
  Vendor must provide a replacement amount of hot mix Asphalt that same day.   
7.	Delivery of Asphalt is required to be 60-80 tons per hour on site at Naval Base Venture County.  This rate has proven to allow students the time needed to work with the Asphalt and not make them feel completely rushed taking away from their training.
8.	Vendor must be aware that access to NBVC can take in upwards of 20 minutes due to force protection measures in place that day.  It is their responsibility to ensure drivers and the trucks they drive must meet the bases policies for entry.  A representative from the Equipment Operator School house will meet trucks at the access gate to the base to escort them to the job site.
  Representative does not and will not have privileges to escort trucks on base if the truck or driver does not meet a base access policy.
9.	Vendor must ensure that the access to the base is included in their delivery plan to ensure Asphalt still meets specifications when delivered to job site.
10.	Delivery Truck will be required to unload product into the hopper of the Asphalt paving machine.  The occasional job site restriction may require driver to dump into a wheeled front-end loader bucket due to site limitations. 
11.	Unless otherwise specified thru communication from Instructor Staff to Asphalt Batch Plant, Asphalt is to arrive at NBVC no later than 0830 on the days specified for delivery.
  If Asphalt delivery takes place, later the course of instruction can cause the crews to be training in the dark.

<DESC><p>This is a non-competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-12-Q-80023 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55, effective February 2, 2012. The NAICS Code is 541990 and the Small Business size standard is $6 million. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a non-competitive basis to Cahill Swift to organize and deliver one-day seminars that will provide essential information to facilitate Federal Transit Administration covered employers' compliance with the drug and alcohol testing regulations (49CFR Part 655 and Part 40) in accordance with the Statement of Work below.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (Begin)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br /><br />The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees in aviation, trucking, railroads, mass transit, pipelines and other transportation industries. DOT publishes rules on who must conduct drug and alcohol tests, how to conduct those tests and what procedures to use when testing. These regulations cover all transportation employers, safety-sensitive transportation employees and service agents - roughly 12.1 million people. <br />The mission of FTA is to ensure that the drug and alcohol testing policies and goals of the Secretary of Transportation are developed and carried out in a consistent, efficient, and effective manner within the transportation industries for the ultimate safety and protection of the traveling public. FTA has tasked the Volpe Center to assist in meeting these goals. This is partially accomplished through the provision of training by the Volpe Center to assist FTA grantees, state DOTs, sub-recipients, safety-sensitive contractors, FTA-covered employers, vendors and others in understanding to the greatest extent possible the spirit, letter and law of the drug and alcohol testing regulations (49 CFR Parts 655 and 40). <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK<br />&nbsp;<br />The objective of this effort is to organize and deliver one-day seminars that will provide essential information to facilitate FTA covered employers' compliance with the drug and alcohol testing regulations (49 CFR Part 655 and Part 40). The seminars will focus, in particular, especially on recent revisions to 49 CFR Part 40 (Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs), FTA Drug and Alcohol Compliance Audit procedures and concerns with DOT qualified collectors and collection sites. <br />The contractor is not responsible for determining or procuring the training venue. The Contractor shall provide the necessary staff, laptop and if necessary, customized MS-PowerPoint presentation to perform the following tasks: <br /><br />The following list details the required specifications of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Regulations One-Day Seminars.<br /><br />1. Conference Preparation Location selection collaboration<br />b. Presentation preparation<br />c. Training material development<br />d. travel<br /><br />2. One-Day Training and Post-Training Q&amp;A<br />a. training sessions <br />b. Q&amp;A and Policy Review</p>
<p>Task 1. Seminar Preparation and Travel<br />The Volpe Center will identify the host, location and specific date for each of 12 seminars. The Volpe Center will provide the Contractor with each individual location, host and schedule information six weeks prior to the seminar date. The Volpe Center, will collaborate with each host to identify potential attendees within the seminar proximity, and will make attempts to contact those employers or individuals and issue invitations to them. The Contractor and Volpe will, through discussions with the host, identify specific areas of training needed and will customize the training to cover these requirements. The Contractor will use the FTA-approved MS-PowerPoint presentation as the main training tool. The Contractor will revise the FTA-approved MS-PowerPoint presentation as necessary to include these areas of identified needs. The Contractor will submit the revised MS-PowerPoint presentation to Volpe for review and approval by e-mail, ten days prior to the scheduled seminar date. The presentation will be revised per Volpe comments, at least seven days prior to the date of the seminar.</p>
<p>Task 2. Twelve One-Day Training Seminars and Post-Training Q&amp;A<br />Each seminar will commence at 9:00 a.m. and conclude at 4:00 p.m. and will include 15-minute morning and afternoon breaks and a 60-minute lunch break. At 4:00 p.m., the Contractor will be available, at the seminar site, for a 30-minute informal Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) session. The seminar will include a detailed review of recent regulatory revisions, a review of the FTA drug and alcohol compliance audit process and a description of the most common errors, as determined through the compliance audits, including collection site issues. <br /><br />The Contractor will collaborate with Volpe Center staff to identify those issues identified through discussions with the individual seminar hosts and attendees that most dramatically impact transit safety. This report will be issued to FTA through the Volpe Center one week following each seminar.</p>
<p>3.0 DELIVERABLES AND SCHEDULE<br />(See attachment No.1 for deliverables and schedule table)</p>
<p>4.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />&nbsp;<br />From date of award through January 31, 2013.</p>
<p>5.0 TRAVEL<br /><br />The contractor will make travel arrangements collaboratively with Volpe Center Staff. The contractor will be responsible for all travel costs associated with the contractor staff. It will be necessary in most cases for the Contractor to travel to the training site the day before the presentation.<br /><br />The Volpe Center will identify the host organization, seminar location and determine the specific date of training for each of the 12 seminars. The Volpe Center will provide this information to the Contractor a minimum of 6 weeks prior to the date of the seminar. Host organizations and seminar locations will be restricted to CONUS and outside CONUS non-foreign locations. When the Volpe Center deems necessary, the Contractor will rent an automobile for travel from the hotel to the seminar location and from the hotel to the airport. The car rental requirement will be provided to the contractor, if necessary, 30 days prior to the seminar.<br /><br />6.0&nbsp; GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION<br /><br />The Volpe Center will provide the contractor with theVolpe and FTA approved MS-PowerPoint presentation template, via e-mail, 30 days prior to the initial seminar, with any revisions provided, to the contractor, 14 days prior to subsequent seminars.<br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK (End)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>1.  PLASTIC WINDOW SHADES AT CONTROL HOUSE CAB (8 TILTING WINDOWS).<br><br>a.  Provide shades with roller/spring tension operating hardware conforming to FAA-ANI-300-380, SPECIFICATION SECTION 12505 - ATCT TRANSPARENT PLASTIC WINDOW SHADES, dated 06/06.  Shades to be 5 mil thick, dark, heavy duty, F72 SR (scratch resistant) plastic sheet, mounted on spring tension rollers with lock pulley and chord at bottom to maintain position and tension of extended shade so as to prevent sag when shade is extended.  <br><br>        i)  If the space between the shade and the window frame allows light into the Cab space such that it is detrimental to control operations, and/or if reflections from the aluminum spacer at the perimeter of the insulated glass pane causes glare problems, consider adhering a strip of plastic shade material to the interior face of the glass, about 2 inch wide and continuous at the jambs and sill of each window pane.  This "fix" was implemented at the air traffic control tower at Lambert-St. Louis Airport to address similar problems.  <br><br>2.  PLASTIC WINDOW SHADES AT WINDOWS OTHER THAN AT CONTROL HOUSE CAB (6 WINDOWS EXCLUDING EXTERIOR WINDOWS AT STAIR ENCLOSURE).<br><br>a.  Provide shades with roller/chain operating hardware.  Where vent windows are located above fixed windows, provide separate roller and shade for each window.  Provide chain gear operation to raise and lower the shade.  Shade material to be the same as that specified for Cab window shades.  At the full glass doors it may be better to apply a plastic screen material to the glass face with similar light transmittance as that provided by the shades on the adjacent windows.<br><br><br>3.  Due to the tilted odd shape windows, contractor will be required to measure windows to ensure correct measurement at their standards prior to manufacturing the shades.<br><br>4.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

<p>Provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

Signed quotes must indicate quantity, unit price and total amount for each item. Offerors shall include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions and provisions included in the solicitation. Quote shall also contain all other documentation specified herein.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF OFFERS: The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>LATE OFFERS: Quotations or modification of quotes received at the address specified for the receipt of offers after the exact time specified for receipt of offers WILL NOT be considered.</p>
<p>EVALUATION/AWARD:</p>
<p>(1) Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer. Award will be made to the acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated cost or price, meeting or exceeding the acceptability of standards for non-cost factors, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements.<br />(2) Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. The price quotation will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the pricing schedule by the unit price for each Contract Line Items Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount of each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price.<br />(3) After the cursory review is performed, the government will start with the lowest price offer to evaluate technical acceptability of each named candidate. "Candidate" is the individual person submitted for candidacy by the offeror. The technical documentation shall be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must submit qualifying documentation demonstrating the candidate has at least one year of current experience in A+, Network+, and Security+. "Current" experience is defined as any experience within the past five years.<br />(4) If the lowest priced offer is determined to be technically acceptable, that offer represents the best value to the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offer is not judged to be technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offer is judged to be technically acceptable or until all offers are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make a best value award decision.</p>

The proposals will be evaluated under two (2) evaluation factors:  Past Performance and Price.  <br><br>Factor 1: Past Performance<br>   <br>Factor 2: Price<br><br>		(2) Relative Importance of Factors and Elements.  The relative importance of Past Performance is weighted significantly higher than Price.<br><br>	b. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br><br>PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE EVALUATIONS:  The Government evaluation team will evaluate Past Performance and Price.  <br><br>FACTOR I - PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: Offerors must thoroughly demonstrate in their Past Performance history their likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS), or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  <br><br>Recency Assessment:  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past (six) 6 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.<br><br>Relevancy Assessment:  To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature, work, size, magnitude ($100,000 - $170,000), and scope.  The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine its relevancy to the services/products being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical sub-contractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or sub-contractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  Offerors may identify state and local government and private contracts that are similar to the Government's requirements.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a  "Neutral" rating for the Past Performance factor.<br><br>Adjectival Ratings: The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one of the ratings defined below.  An offeror whose proposal demonstrates no past performance will be rated "Neutral."<br><br>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br>Rating	Description<br>Acceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.  <br>(See note below) <br>Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br><br><br>FACTOR II - PRICE EVALUATION:  The Government will evaluate each offerors' total proposed price to determine if the offerors proposed prices are fair and reasonable utilizing price analysis techniques in accordance with the guidelines in FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be assigned an adjectival rating. <br><br><br>7. AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION<br><br>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical, past performance and price standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<br><br>(xxxvi)	Offerorors that previously submitted proposals (prior to 1100 AM (EST) 23 February 2012, shall contact CPT Ramon Ramos via email to confirm that previously submitted proposals are still effective.  Otherwise, contractors shall submit their proposals by the deadline specified below.<br><br>(xxxvii)	Submission of proposals shall be forwarded by Friday, 2 March 2012, 1100 AM EST.

<p>Description</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ), Solicitation Number SP3300-12-Q-5020.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55 effective 02 February 2012, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARs) DPN 20120130 edition effective 30 Jan 2012, and the Defense Logistics Agency Directive (DLAD) current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2012-21. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/</p>
<p>This acquisition is a total 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside among certified resellers of Enterasys equipment. The associated NAICS code is 334210, and the associated small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DLA Distribution has a requirement for the enclosed Enterasys brand name equipment. <br />See the attached schedule of supplies/services for Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) identification. Part Numbers shown in the schedule of supplies/services are Enterasys Part Numbers. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after contract award.</p>
<p>Delivery is required to the following address: <br />Supply Branch<br />M/F Whse 3-1, SB3200<br />DDJC-Tracy<br />25600 S. Chrisman Road<br />Tracy, Ca 95376</p>
<p>Offeror must be a certified reseller or agent of the manufacturer for the products requested. All products and components must be manufacturer new, sourced directly from the manufacturer or via an authorized distributor, and must include the manufacturer's full hardware and/or software warranty. No third party, refurbished, or gray market items will be accepted. All products must be supportable via the manufacturer's extended support contracts without recertification by the manufacturer. All licenses, warranties, and extended support contracts must convey to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />This requirement includes with the solicitation the enclosed brand name justification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c):</p>
<p>DLA Distribution San Joaquin, Ca utilizes Enterasys brand name hardware for all of the switching needs of the organization. Enterasys is the actual manufacturer of the network equipment which is proprietary in nature. As such, Enterasys maintains exclusive rights to all products and services. In addition, maintenance support of the Enterasys brand name equipment must be performed either by Enterasys or an Enterasys Authorized Support Partner. It is essential that the Enterasys products be utilized to provide for proper maintenance of the systems. Selection of any other hardware/software would deviate from the equipment standards used within DLA Distribution San Joaquin, Ca. Deviation from this solution would invalidate our security posture. To date, DLA Distribution San Joaquin, Ca has not found any other vendor that has the capability to integrate itself with this proprietary solution.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order resulting from this notice. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>The method of payment for supplies/services under this contract will be by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Medium Range Maritime Unmanned Aerial System (MRMUAS) is hereby cancelled. No re-solicitation is planned and no further action will be taken. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Rationale<br /></span></strong>The FY13 President's budget announced termination of Medium Range Maritime Unmanned Aerial System (MRMUAS) program; however, the Navy was still considering awarding the MRMUAS BAA efforts in 2012 because of the positive benefits to other current and future UAS programs. After considerable deliberation and weighing these broader benefits against fiscal constraints, the Navy has decided to fund completion of the Analysis of Alternatives but will not go forward with the award of the BAA studies. The decision not to award the BAA study contracts is driven solely by budgetary constraints.
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command appreciates the effort put forth by all respondents to this solicitation and looks forward to participation by industry in future UAS solicitations.</p>
<p><br />For further questions please communicate with the&nbsp;listed points of contact (POC).</p>

     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award.

<DESC>The Office of Acquisition Management, Contracts and Grants (AMCG), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has a requirement for 10 parking spaces for senior staff. The government intends to negotiate using FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items. Details of requirement are below.
<p>The government will issue a purchase order to the lowest price technically acceptable. In order for any offeror to qualify as technically acceptable, they must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Spaces must be able to accommodate at a minimum nine (9) automobiles the size of a Sports Utility Vehicle (minimum size standards for the garage/space shall be an Automobile the size of a Cadillac Escalade or its equivalent). The requirement also necessitates one (1) RESERVED parking spot.<br />&bull; The garage shall operate within the hours of 5am - 8pm.<br />&bull; The garage shall be within 2 blocks of 409 3rd St. SW, Washington, DC 20024. <br />&bull; Spaces must be available for the following periods:<br />Base Period: March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012<br />Option I: January 1, 2013 through March 31, 2013<br />Option II: April 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013</p>
<p>Interested offerors shall submit their cost proposal as follows:</p>
<p>Space Type <br />Rate for Base Period <br />Rate for Option I <br />Rate for Option II <br /><br />The government will evaluate proposals based on the total contract value, as if all options were to be exercised.&nbsp; See attachment for applicable terms and conditions.<br /><br />FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (JULY 1990)</p>

The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended in an effort to answer questions proposed by interested offerors, and to specify the distance from the main facility.&nbsp; The time for submitting quotes SHALL NOT BE EXTENDED by issuing this amendment.<br />
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>1. Where were your 9-10 spaces before/currently?<br />In the garage located at 409 3rd St. SW, Washington, DC 20024</p>
<p>2. How does the contractor submit the proposal?<br />The contractor shall demonstrate in its quote that it meets all of the minimum requirements listed in the RFQ (note: please see the clarification below on the distance from the facility), in addition to its price quote. Additionally, provide at least 1 past performance reference.</p>
<p>3. Garage shall operate with the hours of 5:00 am - 8:00 pm. Does this require the proposed facility to be physically open and staffed during these times as opposed to the parkers simply having access during these timeframes.<br />Parkers shall have access during these timeframes.</p>
<p>4. Do the end users need the ability to self-park or is valet and the need to potentially leave their key an option for this opportunity.<br />Self-parking only.</p>
<p>5. Will these individuals be primarily parked for the day once they arrive or will they be entering/exiting multiple times a day.<br />Parkers shall be able to come and go as they please within the required timeframes.</p>
<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>
<p>The government feels as though 2 blocks is too broad an interpretation for the distance from the building requiring parking, and therefore is clarifying that any facility be within 0.2 miles of 409 3rd St. SW, Washington, DC 20024. The government will use an online mapping tool to determine the distance from the facility to the address of the parking facility.</p>

<DESC><p>The following are the questions that have been received and the government's response to them:</p>
<p>Question 1: We need any historical data on volumes of waste generated during cleanings at each facility so we can determine quantities of drums needed. We are assuming we will need to provide drums for waste containerization as per Section 1.3.6 of the Performance Work Statement even though Chapter 10, section 10.1.1 of OPLAN 19-3 states that "Drum or containers for wastes generated by servicing operations will be provided by the 673 CES/CEANQHWC as necessary."</p>
<p>Answer 1: This contract represents a new approach to the OWS service and maintenance work. Historically, the contractor, in the process of cleaning the OWS unit would remove all of the water, oil, and sludge together into a vacuum truck. This truck would then transport all material to one location and separate out phases for drying. Therefore, the material to be disposed of was a dry "cake-like" material with a low moisture content. Unfortunately, changes in the regulations now prevent us from continuing this process. As a result, the sludge that will have to be removed and drummed during cleanings will have a much higher moisture contain and thereby greater volume. As a result, we have no way of knowing the amounts/volumes that will be removed from each location.</p>
<p>Question 2: CLIN 0002 lists a quantity of 21, but for the base period (1 Jan 2012-30 Sep 2012) there are only four (4) months of "Seasonal OWS Cleanings" for the three (3) specified buildings for a total of twelve (12)?</p>
<p>Answer 2: This is correct because the base year has been reduced to a 9 month period.<br />Question 3: Please confirm the methodology that will be used to evaluate the bids for this scope of work and the work histories of prospective bidders.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Please refer to FAR ADDENDUM 52.212-2 (B) within the solicitation for clarification.</p>
<p>Question 4: Please explain the deviation of a 3-year requirement--especially given that the Government has historically required 5 years.</p>
<p>Answer 4: The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet requirement and it is in the best interest of the government. The government is changing the original 3 year past performance to 5 years.</p>
<p>Question 5: In the event, a contractor "teams" with another company with a higher level of experience in Oil/Water Separator maintenance, would that contractor get maximum benefit for the experience of the team if that contractor were to be the prime contractor on this project?</p>
<p>Answer 5: Please refer to FAR ADDENDUM 52.212-2 (B) within the solicitation for clarification. Total files size shall not exceed 4 MB.</p>
<p>Question 6: Since requiring experience in the past 3 years will preclude all local contractors from bidding this contract, would the Contracting Office consider experience in the past 5 years as being acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer 6: The government is changing the original 3 years past performance to 5 years. Please be sure to fully understand the Performance Work Statement; in that the methodology has changed significantly from what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>Question 7: The solicitation states that the price and past performance proposals should not exceed 25 pages - these forms are provided with the solicitation. (Ref pg. 40) Is there a page total on the Technical portion of proposal submittals?</p>
<p>Answer 7: The Technical portion of the proposal shall not exceed 25 pages.&nbsp; Total file size shall not exceed 4 MB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If hand carrying proposal on 5 or 6 December please deliver to Ms. Cindy Thompson in Suite 344.</p>

TOGUS
	
Togus VA is installing a CHP (combined heat & power) energy trigeneration boiler plant that will require the use of wood chips to combust.  The size is targeted at 2"x2"x1/4", no larger than 2.5"x2.5"x3/4" and no smaller 1/8" x 1/8" x 1/8".   Chips must have moisture content between 15 and 50%.  Up to 5% Bark is allowed but must be chip size.  To be delivered as in the range of 30 to 35 or so ton load (certified scaling slip required) in floating (walking bed) tractor trailer rig to the Togus CHP chip storage unload point.  Payment will be based on certified scaling slip weight ($/ton).  No rocks, gravel, dirt, ice, water, paint, nails, or other miscellaneous materials will be allowed.  If load has improperly sized chips or contains unwanted material it will be rejected on the spot to be carried away by supplier.  Any spilled chips must be cleaned up by the supplier.  The Togus campus route to be taken (unless otherwise directed) is from route 226 to Gate Road to Knox  Road and making a right hand turn  around the gas dispense tanks and back up to the chip unload gate.  The weight of the load maybe measured, the chip size, cleanness of chip, presence of miscellaneous materials, and/or moisture content by the boiler plant supervisor or boiler operators for acceptance or rejection.  Each load must be checked in (phone number TBD) and may be watched by CCTV by VA personnel during unload.  Delivered is to be between the hours of 9AM to 3PM week days unless otherwise directed.

For first time plant commissioning there are special requirements, about 100 loads with controlled moisture content of 37% and of which a few loads of 50% and 20% as these will be required to commission the plant.

Contractors that are required to have their own EVMS shall follow procedures contained in the VA EVMS Application Guide. 

2.  The following paragraphs reflect EVMS requirements and may be modified as necessary for selected use.

a. Integrated Contractor Services.  This contract requires that contractors providing direct support services to VA staff will be required to participate in the VA EVMS and submit timesheets.  Contractor personnel integrated into VA Staff and providing direct support in the completion of VA project tasks as part of the Government Earned Value Management System must provide assigned task planning, executing, controlling, and closing information to government project management staff.  Gathering this information would include having individual contractor resources enter their planned and actual work time against their assigned activities into the government project tracking/timesheet application.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring all work information is correct. 

 Or-

a. Contractor Independent Deliverables.  This contract requires the contractor to operate as a distinct entity to produce a deliverable(s).  The contractor is required to have its own compliant EVMS, per VA Directive 6061, Table B-1, and provide EVM reports to the VA. 

(1). Non-Compliant EVMS.  If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the American National Standards Institute /Electronics Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA) Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards. 

(2). EVMS Reports.  As a minimum, contracting officers shall require contractors to submit EVMS monthly reports for those contracts for which an EVMS applies. 

(3). Subcontractors.  EVMS requirements will be applied to subcontractors using the same rules as applied to the prime contractor.  VA will decide the flow down of the EVM requirement to subcontractors. In all cases, the prime contractor is responsible for reporting EVM data.

(4). EVMS Plan.  When an offeror is required to provide an EVMS plan as part of its proposal, the contracting officer will determine the adequacy of the proposed EVMS plan prior to contract award. 

(5). Performance Measurement Baseline.  Contractors are required to resource load schedules in order to set a performance measurement baseline.  Resources do not have to be specifically named.

(6). Program Management Reviews.  The Contractor shall conduct Program Management Review (PMR) meetings at mutually agreed upon dates and locations.  During these reviews, the contractor shall present integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance status.  Government Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads or functional managers shall include cost information in discussions of schedule status, technical performance, and risk using earned value as an integrating tool.  The following shall be addressed: Cost/schedule trends, significant cost/schedule/technical variances, projected impacts, quantified risk assessments, and corrective action plans. 

(7). Contractor Earned Value Management.  The Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466A), and Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) shall be developed, maintained, updated/statused and reported on a monthly basis per deliverable requirements, respectively.  The contractor shall establish, maintain, and use in the performance of this contract, an integrated management system compliant with the Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) ANSI/EIA-748 as determined by the Government. 

An EVMS that has been formally validated and accepted by the cognizant contracting officer is required for all (fixed price, cost, or incentive) contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements valued at or greater than $50 million in then-year dollars.  The application of these concepts shall provide for early indicators of contract cost and schedule problems.

For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million then-year dollars, the following statement applies:  The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review).  The contractor will submit an EVMS description and proof of prior certification with its bid.

(8). Integrated Baseline Review (IBR).  The contractor shall review its performance measurement baseline plan with the Government within six months of contract award or initiation of an Undefinitized Contract Action, and subsequently, when required, following major changes to the baseline.  The Government will verify during the IBR, and follow-on IBRs when required that the contractor has established and maintains a reliable performance measurement baseline.  The contractor will ensure that the baseline includes the entire contract technical scope of work consistent with contract schedule requirements, and has adequate resources assigned.  The contractor will assure the Government that effective earned value methodologies are used to accurately measure work accomplished and determine contract cost, schedule, and technical performance.  The IBR will be used to achieve a mutual understanding of the baseline plan, cost and schedule risk, and the underlying management processes used for planning and controlling the project. 

(9). Subcontract Cost/Schedule Management and Reporting.  Subcontracts exceeding $20M in then-year dollars will apply the requirements of the Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) and the Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466).  For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million, the following statement applies:  The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the Government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review).  EVMS flow down to contracts of less than $20M in then-year dollars or Firm Fixed Price contracts that exceed 12 months duration is a risk-based decision and will be as mutually agreed between the contractor and the Government. 

(10). Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS).  The contractor shall develop and maintain the CWBS and CWBS dictionary.  

(11). over Target Baseline (OTB)/Restructure.  The contractor may conclude the baseline no longer represents a realistic plan in terms of budget/schedule execution.  In the event the contractor determines an OTB/Restructuring action is necessary, the contractor must obtain Government approval prior to implementing an OTB/Restructuring action.  The request should also include detailed implementation procedures as well as an implementation timeframe.  The contractor will not implement the OTB/Restructuring prior to receiving written approval from the Contracting Officer. 

(12). Award Fee Criteria.  For contracts that include an award fee, the contractor will demonstrate the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) as a tool for cost and schedule control and as a basis for communicating with the Government.  The Government will determine the eligibility for of and amount of any award fee granted. In addition to demonstrating the use of EVM award fee criteria for the contractor will include the following:

(a). Maintain timely detail planning as far in advance as practical; 

(b). Ensure the system provides accurate cost/schedule performance status, reliable and timely cost/schedule projections, and quantified risk assessments;  

 (c). Provide clear and comprehensive explanations of performance problems and associated impacts, and establish and carry out effective recovery plans; 

 (d). Control and minimize changes to the baseline particularly in the near term;  

 (e). Ensure all subcontractor-authorized effort is detail planned into measurable objective work packages to the extent possible; 

 (f). Provide program-level Estimate at Completion (EAC) assessments that include consideration of potential risks and cost containment plans; and   

(g). Demonstrate responsiveness regarding management system and cost/schedule performance questions and issues/concerns raised by the Government.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)</p>

<DESC>Ammendment 1 - Posted 2-27-12 Market Survey is hereby ammended to include the following revision into the Statement of Work to allow extensive experience as an FTA auditor in the qualification section of the SOW as shown below.
Pargraph 6.6 Must serve or have served as an FTA auditor or have extensive experience conducting FTA-equivalent audits related to drug/alcohol compliance within the public transit industry to apply knowledge in the classroom as it relates to program compliance.
*************************************************************************
This is a Market Survey for a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to conduct/revise and develop the Substance Abuse Management and Program Compliance and Reasonable Suspicion Determination for Supervisors courses for the Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) as it relates to Transportation, either publicly or privately owned which provides to the public, general or special service on a regular and continuing basis. Also known as "mass transportation," "mass transit," and "transit." Such transportation provides local or regional, multi-occupancy vehicle passenger service generally defined as urban and rural public transportation services including commuter trains, ferry service, heavy rail (rapid rail or subway), light rail (streetcars or trolleys), and local transit buses. Transit describes local area common carrier passenger transportation configured to provide scheduled service on fixed routes on a non-reservation basis.  Required Expertise:  49 CFR, Part 40 and Part 655
Please see the attached draft Statement of Work for more information. 
The responses to this market survey will be used for Informational Purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will NOT pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing instructional services and course material revision and development in the specific areas of expertise specified. 
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. 
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this effort is 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with a size standard of $7.0 Million. 
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO RFQ: Pesticide Project for Tribes
The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate all Questions & Answers pertaining to Request for Quote (RFQ-CA-12-00001). They are listed below and will be posted on the following website:http://www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm.
Questions & Answers to RFQ-CA-12-00001
Question 1: Will there be Vendor Follow-up required on the training received? And if so how many tribes will require the follow-up?
Answer 1: "Vendor follow-up" is described in Phase II.    We anticipate that the trainer will be able to answer all or most questions that participants ask at the training.  However, training attendees could request materials or ask questions that the vendor may not be able to provide or answer at the training. 
Question 2:Will the selected vendor be required to pay tribal vendor fees?
Answer 2:Yes, if applicable. Question 3: How many locations will be used to perform the tribal training?
Answer 3: See Section 8 of the Statement of Work, entitled, "WORK ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONTRACT," as follows:  "The contractor shall select and secure, based on his or her knowledge and expertise, one (1) location in California, Arizona or Nevada to hold the training event, which shall accommodate a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 30 attendees, for classroom and field training.  The location shall be convenient to tribal attendees and cost-efficient."
  (a) The EPA website containing the RFQ and all information pertaining to this procurement is http://www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm.  Once at this website, clink on the link titled, "Region 9 Pestacide Project for Tribes Training on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Schools, Developing and Implementing IMP-In-School Plans for Tribes (RFQ-CA-12-00001) ".

<AWARDEE>PARTNERSHIP FOR PUBLIC SERVICE, INC.1100 NEW YORK AVENUESUITE 1090 EASTWASHINGTONDC200056107USA
<DESC>SYNOPSIS/NOTICE OF INTENT
The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer plans to contract with the Partnership for Public Service to provide support and guidance for a cultural transformation effort at the Department of Energy, with an emphasis on leadership roles, communication, data analysis, and action planning.  The Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract.  The period of performance for this award will span a twelve (12) month base period and commence no later than 15 days from the date of Award. The government may elect to extend the contract for a one-year option period within the term of the contract.
The principal place of performance will be the DOE headquarters facility in Washington DC and Germantown, MD. Contractor hosted events, as specified, will occur off-site in the Washington DC Metro Area. Video and/or teleconferencing with DOE sites outside of the HQ area may also be held. 
PARTNERSHIP FOR PUBLIC SERVICE, INC. (PPS) is the only recognized not-for-profit organization with the stated mission of revitalizing the federal government by inspiring a new generation to serve through the way government works.  The transformation program is highly specialized to DOE agency and departmental needs. PPS is uniquely positioned to provide immediate support and guidance for this cultural transformation effort at the Department of Energy because it operates a proprietary database and data analysis tool for the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.  Through its work with other Federal agencies, PPS has developed a data-based action planning approach that provides staff members with an opportunity to validate the survey results, provide additional qualitative feedback, and offer ideas to improve the workplace. The requested services are in the best interest of the Department of Energy.  The Department?s rankings and overall index scores from the Best Places to Work ha ve declined over the previous three survey periods.  On average, agencies that have worked with the PPS have improved overall satisfaction and commitment by approximately 6% annually.

In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented byFAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only oneResponsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
This is a combined Synopsis/Notice of Intent to Award; however, interested parties may submit a capability statement and rationale by Thursday, March 8, 2012 at 9:00am (Eastern) via e-mail to Danielle.Hicks@hq.doe.gov. The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.
A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses tothis notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normallybe considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>&nbsp;This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Repairs was completed to the drain south west side of the vestibule in the courtyard at Bldg 110. A cracked clay pipe that the building drain was connected to caused the area to sink &amp; needed the repair.When the contractor started to dig, the drain pipe was cracked lower than was originally projected so it required a deeper hole (approx. 9.5 ft), more labor &amp; more shoring of the walls. The original cost was estimated at under $5000 which would have been covered by MERR/GRR but with additional work it came to a total of $7728.48. GSA inspectors were onsite to approve the additional work that was needed. due to time frame, site conditions and expenses considered; it would not have been &nbsp;feasible for the government to stop work.The workis in the scope of the O &amp; M contract but over the repair threshold.<br /><br /><br />
