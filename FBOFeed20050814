PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES/SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION/CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, SOLICITS TO AWARD A SIMPLIFIED ACQUSITION. THIS POSTING IS RE-ADVERTISED TO OPEN TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. PREVIOUS FEDBIZOPPS POSTING WAS FROM JULY 12, 2005 THROUGH JULY 22, 2005, FOR SOURCES SOUGHT, AND WAS FOR TOTAL SMALL BUSINESSES. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES INTERESTED, WERE DEEMED TO BE UNQUALIFIED TO PERFORM THE REQUIREMENT(S).   SEE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT BELOW.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  DATE OF AWARD THROUGH ONE YEAR

SPECIFIC OBJECT OF THE PROCUREMENT IS THE FOLLOWING:

Background

THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NATIONALS FAITH-BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH ALL THE COLLABORATIVE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND TREATMENT AS MANDATED BY H.R. 4923.  THIS CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN JANUARY 2001, AND THE PRESIDENTS FAITH INITIATIVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT RECOVERY GRANTS ISSUED IN JUNE 2004, AUTHORIZED BY SECTIONS 501(D)(5) AND 509 OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, AS AMENDED AND THE SECRETARY OF D.H.H.S, MIKE LEAVITT, 500 DAY PLAN ISSUED MAY 2005, CREATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among and society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.    In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, which expanded the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration. The Executive order requires HHS and other Federal Agencies to identify and eliminate regulatory and programmatic barriers that would prevent faith based and grassroots community organizations from applying for and successfully receiving Federal grants, contracts, and the effective delivery of services in local communities.  
In 2000 to the present SAMHSA undertaken a  technical assistance initiative to assist grassroots community and faith based organization  with the  fundamentals of writing successful Federal grants and enhancing treatment and prevention service delivery. From 2001-2004, SAMHSA has provided technical assistance to over 6500 individuals representing faith and community organizations and has collaborated with community intermediary organizations to facilitate these activities. Faith and community based organizations have benefited from this training and as a result have been recipients of various Federal, state and local grants. While this is the case, many grassroots organizations have had difficulty applying successfully for Federal grant funds because of such reasons as weak infrastructures, inadequate capacity to deliver services, and the lack of collaborative supports and partnerships. 

Because of this, SAMHSA’S technical assistance for RY 2005 will focus on organizations that demonstrate operational readiness to delver quality treatment and recovery to compete successfully for SAMHSA grant awards. Therefore, the goal of technical assistance activity for fiscal year 2005 is to assist faith and community organizations with successfully competing for SAMHSA grants awards.

THIS POSTING IS RE-ADVERTISED TO OPEN TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. PREVIOUS FEDBIZOPPS POSTING WAS FROM JULY 12, 2005 THROUGH JULY 22, 2005, FOR SOURCES SOUGHT, AND WAS SET ASIDE  FOR TOTAL SMALL BUSINESSES. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES INTERESTED, WERE DEEMED TO BE TECHNICALLY UNQUALIFIED TO PERFORM THE REQUIREMENT(S).   SEE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT BELOW.

SPECIFIC OBJECT OF THE PROCUREMENT IS THE FOLLOWING:

Background

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among and society’s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.    In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, which expanded the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton’s Administration. The Executive order requires HHS and other Federal Agencies to identify and eliminate regulatory and programmatic barriers that would prevent faith based and grassroots community organizations from applying for and successfully receiving Federal grants, contracts, and the effective delivery of services in local communities.  
In 2000 to the present SAMHSA undertaken a  technical assistance initiative to assist grassroots community and faith based organization  with the  fundamentals of writing successful Federal grants and enhancing treatment and prevention service delivery. From 2001-2004, SAMHSA has provided technical assistance to over 6500 individuals representing faith and community organizations and has collaborated with community intermediary organizations to facilitate these activities. Faith and community based organizations have benefited from this training and as a result have been recipients of various Federal, state and local grants. While this is the case, many grassroots organizations have had difficulty applying successfully for Federal grant funds because of such reasons as weak infrastructures, inadequate capacity to deliver services, and the lack of collaborative supports and partnerships. 

Because of this, SAMHSA’s technical assistance FY 2005 will focus on organizations that demonstrate operational readiness to deliver quality treatment and recovery to compete successfully for SAMHSA grant awards.  The successful contractor must be capable of providing technical assistance to faith and community based organizations.

The Executive order requires HHS and other Federal Agencies to identify and eliminate regulatory and programmatic barriers that would prevent faith based and grassroots community organizations from applying for and successfully receiving Federal grants, contracts, and the effective delivery of services in local communities.  
In 2000 to the present SAMHSA undertaken a  technical assistance initiative to assist grassroots community and faith based organization  with the  fundamentals of writing successful Federal grants and enhancing treatment and prevention service delivery. From 2001-2004, SAMHSA has provided technical assistance to over 6500 individuals representing faith and community organizations and has collaborated with community intermediary organizations to facilitate these activities. Faith and community based organizations have benefited from this training and as a result have been recipients of various Federal, state and local grants. While this is the case, many grassroots organizations have had difficulty to applying successfully for Federal grant funds because of such reasons as weak infrastructures, inadequate capacity to deliver services, and the lack of collaborative supports and partnerships. 

Because of this, SAMHSA’s technical assistance FY 2005 will focus on organizations that demonstrate operational readiness to deliver quality treatment and recovery to compete successfully for SAMHSA grant awards.  The successful contractor shall have the capability of performing technical assistance to  grassroots faith based and community  organizations, that provide services to risk populations in underserved areas in North Carolina and South Carolina.  The goals are to enhance treatment potential within the community, increase the potential for treatment and prevention education among clergy and community leaders, identify sources of funds and materials to enhance network ability, collaboration, planning and evaluating community efforts and services.    

Purpose

SAMHSA desires to procure the services of Positive Community Impact, Inc (PCI).  The goal of technical assistance activity for fiscal year 2005 is assist faith and community organizations with successfully competing for SAMHSA grants awards in state of North and South Carolina.
