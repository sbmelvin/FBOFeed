This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>This is a small business set-aside procurement for RCRA Facility Investigations. The purpose of the RFI is to obtain information to fully characterize the nature, extent and rate of migration of releases of hazardous waste or constituents and to interpret this information to determine whether interim corrective measures and/or a Corrective Measures Study may be necessary. Prior to conducting the investigation, the owner or operator (Anniston Army Depot) will in most cases be directed, through a permit or enforcement order, to submit a written plan (the RFI Work Plan) that should propose, in detail, the manner in which the investigation will be conducted. Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) would receive notice from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) that a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) is required.  The RFI field work shall be completed within 180 days of ADEM notification to ANAD unless other actions have been approved by ADEM.  A work plan will be developed for the project including a site-specific health and safety plan, as well as a quality assurance project plan.  The work plan will be submitted to the Contracting officer within 30 days after the award of the task order.  Work will not commence until the approval has been given. North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380; size standard is $12 million.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(a)(7) and 14.205-1(c); therefore hardcopies will not be provided.  Proposals submitted must be in electronic format as stated in the solicitation.  Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the Internet: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ (ASFI).  Estimated issue date is 20 August 2012.  CAUTION:  This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a bidder mailing list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above Internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of your proposal.

There are no per item charges.  <br>  <br>  <br> This is a sole source procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and (FAR 13.501).

<CONTACT>David R. Serwitz, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882463, Email wvy5@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Bachem, Inc., 3132 Kashiwa St., Torrance, California, 90505-4087. <br /><br />The authority for this sole source is FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The NAICS code is 325411, Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing. The requirement for this award is to acquire the following custom synthesized octapeptides:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Quantity (200 mg) of N-(2-Carbamoyl-ethyl)-[13C5; 15N] Val-His-Leu-Thr-Pro-Glu-Glu-Lys-OH trifluoroacetate salt, with a minimum 90 percent purity or greater guaranteed with 95 percent targeted - {AA IS Octapeptide}, and&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Quantity (200 mg) of item number 4074988, N-[(RS)-2-Carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl) - [13C5; 15N]Val-His-Leu-Thr-Pro-Glu-Glu-Lys-OH trifluoroacetate salt; with a minimum 90 percent purity or greater guaranteed with 95 percent targeted for both diastomers, with lead-time within12 weeks -{GA IS Octapeptide}.<br /><br />Bachem is the only source available to provide these custom synthesized octapeptides. These octapeptides are utilized as part of an ongoing testing and analysis project. The project requires that all analysis methods be validated in order to ensure accurate results. The analysis methods using these custom synthesized octapeptides produced by Bachem have already undergone a stringent validation process based on CLIA regulations for method verification and validation. Changing to an octapeptide that has been synthesized by a different source would require a new validation process. Undergoing a new validation process during the course of this project would cause unreasonable delay and expense to the government. Therefore Bachem is the only source available.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Bachem. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to David Serwitz VIA EMAIL ONLY at WVY5@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2013-Q-15411 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN February 20, 2013. The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal requests. All requests must be in writing. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>Offerors must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) or may not be considered for award. Registration can be accomplished at https://www.sam.gov. As of 1 January 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process. Representation and Certification are to be accomplished at https://www.sam.gov. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dun and Bradstreet and can be obtained at http://www.dnb.com/.</p>
<p>This will be a competitive Best Value Source Selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 using the tradeoff source selection process between non-cost factors and cost/price. This approach allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest rated proposal to achieve a best-value contract award. All proposals will be evaluated. Offeror's past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. Award will be based on an integrated assessment of price and past performance of technically acceptable proposals. Although the Government will assess the offerors' technical proposal on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, tradeoffs will not occur on the basis of technical merit. In making tradeoff decision, the Government is equally concerned with obtaining good past performance as it is with selecting an offer with an affordable overall price. The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>a. Technical<br />b. Price<br />c. Past Performance</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN (NOV 2012)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, <br />Kelly S. Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Suite 200<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9075<br />email: kelly.snyder@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>POINT OF CONTACT</p>
<p>Questions and responses should be addressed to the primary contact, Londres Medranda, Contract Specialist, at 719-333-8927 or londres.medranda@us.af.mil, or the alternate point of contact, Diana Myles-South, Contracting Officer, 719-333-8650 or diana.south@us.af.mil.<br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />Address: Building 2348<br />Sijan Hall<br />USAF Academy, CO 80840</p>

It includes vendor questions with Government responses and also includes statements from the FAA.

Based on the results of the market survey the FAA anticipates that the procurement will be a full and open competition.  The FAA may decide to set aside part of the procurement for small business; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.  

Please do not respond to this announcement.  The FAA is anticipating a draft SIR release in April 2013, SIR release in Jul/Aug 2013 and Contract Award in the Spring of 2014.  This schedule is dependent on the receipt of FAA Management approval.

This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of the services, and must not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  The Government is not liable for costs associated with this announcement and will not reimburse any firm for cost incurred.  No solicitation exists at this time.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the FAAs Contract Opportunities web page.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the welding of four (4) tank hemispheres. These hemispheres make up the pressure vessel propellant tanks for the Morpheus vehicle, which supports the Advanced Exploration Systems Program. These hemispheres for the propellant tanks are critical components to the vehicle and its qualification testing.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Thermovac. Thermovac was selected under a previous competitive acquisition for the pressure vessel welding of seven (7) tank hemispheres. Thermovacs welding process has been qualified through lengthy testing and inspections.  It would severely impact the schedule for the government to perform qualification testing of another manufacturers welding procedures and build of aluminum pressure vessels. Additionally, NASA/JSC requires that these 4 tank hemispheres be similar to the initial seven (7) hemispheres originally welded. This factor is important, as it is integral to the assembly, function and performance of the final assembled tanks. It is critical for all these tank hemispheres to follow the same welding process and be made on the same tooling, as any changes can add variability to the finished product and affect with additional repairs further down the road. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Rochelle Overstreet not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 11, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

The maximum combination of orders is $30,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.

The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br><br>CONTRACT INFORMATION: HUBZone solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.

There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.    <br><br>The total estimated contract capacity is $63,960,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive HUBZone businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract. <br><br><br>

<DESC>SOLICITATION NO. W9128F-13-R-0012 <br>  <br> On or about 20 February 2013, this office will issue Request for Proposals for construction/demolition of the ELIMINATE PHANTOM SILOS, PN AFGS126001, WYOMING, MONTANA AND CALIFORNIA.  The solicitation will close on or about 17 April 2013.  <br>  <br> This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED AND OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION. <br>  <br> Provisions in the solicitation documents will provide site visit dates, points of contact, access requirements and other pertinent information in inspecting a Launch Facility and Missile Alert Facility in each state.  The solicitation will include different site visit dates and points of contact for work in each state.  <br>  <br> See 'Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below. <br>  <br> Project Description: <br>  <br> This is a Fully-Designed Project.  The Eliminate Phantom Silo project is a part of the New START Treaty between the United States and Russia. The project will require observation and oversight by Treaty Compliance Officers and National Technical Means 'NTM' teams for the agreed to periods of time to perform observance and recording/verification of non-use status on each designated ICBM Launch Facility 'LF' identified under the project. Project will demand accurate scheduling, reporting and management of the entire removal inventory as identified by Treaty Offices. Project requires 103 ICBM LF to be rendered as non-usable and 9 Missile Alert Facilities 'MAF' to have their infrastructure and limited below grade elements demolished. LF and MAF are located in rural areas throughout Wyoming '50 LF, 4 MAF', Montana '50 LF, 5 MAF' and on Vandenberg AFB, California '3 LF'. Work includes running heavy equipment operations throughout 103 LF and 9 MAF encompassing a grid area of approximately 70 miles east-west by 65 miles north-south in WY, 70 miles east-west by 65 miles north-south in MT and 3 California sites located on Vandenberg AFB. The work at each LF will be phased in two separate phases. The first phase will deal specifically with treaty compliance and LF elimination by means of launch door removal and disposal, filling of ICBM launcher tube with debris, rubble and imported gravel to render as non-usable, and other dismantling and demolition of surrounding launcher silo infrastructure. The second phase will require a concrete cap over the launcher tube with access points to other on-site below grade support structures filled and rendered non-usable. The entire LF site 'each approximately one acre' will be graded to a final specified grade. As part of the second phase, the MAF building structure will remain intact, but the overall site will require infrastructure dismantlement, disposal of support equipment, concrete capping and utilizing fill material to obstruct some below ground access areas. The Contractor will have access to material salvage at the LF and MAF sites. Prior to conducting any operations at the LF and MAF, the Contractor will be required to perform Environmental Baseline Surveys for each LF and MAF, no abatement or removal of recorded materials is required as they are to be abandoned in place. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 CY of various fill material 'i.e., earth, gravel, aggregates, etc.' will be required for import and use throughout the sites to complete the work.      <br>  <br> Other site work in WY and MT for each LF includes the removal of all topside appurtenances outside of the vehicle pad area, but within the project limits 'i.e., pull boxes, markers, antenna poles and bases'. All surface items are to be removed to existing grade with removal of exterior shafts and vents to a minimum of six-feet below grade and capped with concrete. The contractor will be required to weld the Launcher Equipment Building 'LEB' blast door closed and LEB access shaft filled to obstruct access. All topside man hatch access will be concrete capped. The final grading shall include gravel fill on the back side of the silo to match with existing grade. Each LF will final graded to drain freely and conform to natural surroundings. Site work in California will include filling of launcher tube with debris, rubble, imported earth and gravel.  The contractor will complete backfill operations, construct concrete caps, and complete other site demolition items. Existing hard surface 'asphalt and concrete' located on the sites will remain in place. LEB access will be obstructed/removed and/or filled to eliminate any future access. <br>  <br> The estimated demolition/construction cost of this project for basic and all options is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000. <br>  <br> Bidders - Offerors:  <br> Please be advised of on-line registration requirement for Contractor Registration and for Representations and Certifications Application 'ORCA' is now located in System for Award Management 'SAM' database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

South Bend, IN
Solicitation Number:  VA 10112I0063
 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is seeking to lease 71,403 net usable square feet (NUSF) of space plus 520 surface parking spaces for use by VA as an Outpatient Clinic for a firm lease term of up to 20 years.  To meet this need, VA intends to conduct a one-phase lease procurement in which offerors submit to VA an offer to lease a building which is built-to-suit to VA specifications on a land parcel controlled by the offeror and pre-approved by VA.
VA previously advertised for this requirement and identified a short list of sites VA will consider for the procurement.  As several months have passed since that short list was identified, VA is now advertising for Expressions of Interest for sites not previously submitted for possible inclusion on the short list.  
Please see attachment for addition details on how to respond.

Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.

<DESC>REPAIR OF THE CRYOENGINE FOR THE AGM-65 INFRARED IR GUIDANCE AND CONTROL SECTION
<p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the existence of a Bid Qualification Plan for an Age Identification Study of the AGM-65 Maverick Missile Cryoengine</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The USAF is seeking potential contractors to support an AGM-65 Cryoengine repair (NSN: 1420-01-142-4363JB &amp; 1420-01-370-2130JB). AGM-65 Maverick Missile is a unique and aging weapon system requiring periodic testing to preclude catastrophic failure. <br />The AGM-65 IR Cryoengine Assembly is a critical component of the AGM-65 IR Missile Guidance and Control Section (GCS). The AGM-65 Cryoengine cools the IR detectors to approximately -200 &deg;C. This subzero temperature is necessary to properly detect all possible ranges of IR energy that are emitted and encountered during operation. The IR detectors receive and translate IR energy into a video scene displaying variations in temperature as variations in contrast, and allowing a target to be identified by the aircrew and subsequently tracked by the missile. AGM-65 IR missiles with malfunctioning Cryoengines produce a washed out video scene that makes identifying targets difficult and/or impossible. The AGM-65 Cryoengine Assembly is a Sterling closed-loop refrigeration unit that consists of a pump, capillary tube, expander, cold finger, and helium refrigerant. Cooling can take up to 3 minutes once the missile is activated.</p>
<p>This is a Cost Plus Fixed Price (CPFF) contract. For Infrared Cryoengine Repair</p>
<p>Interested offerors should respond to this sources sought within 14 days following the publication of this notice. Responses must clearly demonstrate the qualifications, capability and expertise of the vendor.

Written responses may be sent to the Contracting Officer at OO-ALC/GHGKA, 6033 Elm Lane, Bldg 1247, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825, ______________________________________________________ Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this sources sought. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow-up information requested. This sources sought is directed only to those vendors who believe that they would be capable of supporting this potential requirement. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. Also, in order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey for the Small Arms Shop Set (SASS) <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br>  <br> 1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br>  <br> 2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br>  <br> 3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br>  <br> 4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: quote mark  and  quote mark CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br> 5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br>  <br> 6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as  quote mark Confidential quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br>  <br> THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br> PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: <br>  <br> The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for Small Arms Shop Set (SASS). <br>  <br> 		The SASS provides the necessary components for small arms field and sustainment level maintenance.  It is intended for use by personnel needing small arms repair capabilities at the field and sustainment level. <br>  <br> 		1.  All components supplied with this set shall be industrial quality. For the purposes of this survey, the term  quote mark industrial quality tools quote mark  versus household-use tools or general purpose tools are defined as tools commercially marketed and manufactured for constant, rigorous, industrial or professional environment use. The items offered shall have either achieved industrial market acceptance or have been satisfactory supplied to the Government under current or recent contract for the same or similar requirements.  Industrial quality tools are used primarily by skilled professionals and technicians in such areas as machine shops, automotive maintenance and repair facilities, industrial automotive assembly plants, fleet maintenance facilities, and airline service facilities. The tools will be used for specialized application in an environment of virtual constant use, with application requiring high torque, low slippage, and strict tolerances.  <br>  <br> 		2.   All components must demonstrate Market Acceptance. Market acceptance is demonstrated by the component having a higher percentage of sales to industrial/professional customers than to retail or Government customers. Advertising or marketing literature that indicates  quote mark professional grade quote mark  or  quote mark industrial quality quote mark , or merely stating that an item is  quote mark professional grade quote mark  or  quote mark industrial quality quote mark  is insufficient to establish industrial quality tools since these are terms for which there is no generally accepted definition. A claim that an item is manufactured to an industry consensus standard is also insufficient to establish industrial quality tools. Evidence of acceptance by industrial/professional customers includes sales to fleet operators, distributors, Contractors, industrial and professional users, and sales to distributors who retail exclusively to the professional or industrial market. <br>  <br> 		3.   All components shall be supplied with the warranties. <br>  <br> 		4.  The Small Arms Shop Set (SASS) see DFP 656  <br>  <br> 	 <br>  <br>  <br> INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE: <br>  <br> 1.  Number each response with the appropriate question number. <br>  <br> 2.  You do not have to repeat the question in your response.  <br>  <br> 3.  If you cannot answer a question, please indicate  quote mark No Response. quote mark  <br>  <br> 4.  If a response will satisfy another question, state:  quote mark See response to question XXX. quote mark  <br>  <br> 5.  Include relevant sales media and product manuals.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">This notice is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance FAR 15.201(e) and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. No funds are available to pay for preparation or responses to this RFI and no entitlement or payment of direct and/or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a vendor's submission of a response to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. This RFI is for planning purposes only and any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The Government wants to secure information regarding the capabilities of industry to meet Agency requirements as stated herein. <br /><br />The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (DoD) agency, with its headquarters at Fort Lee, VA. DeCA operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to military personnel, retirees, and their families. DeCA currently operates 248 military commissaries worldwide with annual sales estimated at $6 billion. Of that total, 178 stores are located within the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii, and 70 stores are located in 12 countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>A military commissary is a Government facility providing grocery products, services, and other merchandise to authorized individuals, termed "patrons." It is a facility designed and operated similar to commercial supermarkets. DeCA's goals are to provide the military community with a great shopping experience; sustain a capable, diverse, and engaged civilian workforce; and be a model organization through agility and governance.</p>
<p>DeCA is in the process of updating the performance work statement (PWS) language for the delicatessen and bakery operations to ensure the requirement performance and goals align with the continued success of DeCA's mission, vision, and goals. DeCA's objective is to utilize industry expertise and best practices and seeks industry comments for the revised PWS language attached hereto.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DeCA requests industry comments on the following language and the feasibility of the pricing elements of the requirement criteria. <br /><br />DeCA is seeking a percentage of savings for each of the five product categories listed below. The amount expressed as a percentage of savings is what the offeror proposes to save the commissary patron on each item for the respective product category when evaluated against same or similar items from comparable commercial supermarket operations in a twenty (20) mile local commuting survey area of each commissary location. Offerors shall propose no less than a twenty (20) percent of savings, for each product category, for each CLIN, and corresponding sub-CLINs, as set forth in a potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES. Pricing offered on a sub-CLIN shall be applicable to all locations covered by the CLIN.</p>
<p>Additionally, pricing of the one or more clusters of sub-CLINs offered from the potentially solicited SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES shall include labor, materials, overhead, and profit costs for the work effort required to operate and manage the contracted operations at the locations set forth in the schedule.</p>
<p>**NOTE** The following categories are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>Product Categories:<br />a. Random Weight: Bulk meats, cheeses and other items which are sold by weight and which require additional preparation and or packaging prior to being purchased by the patron. Examples include sliced deli meat, cold salads, salad bar, olives, etc.</p>
<p>b. Bakery: Includes breads, cakes, muffins, pies and other items which are either pre-packaged for immediate sale, or require some preparation from contractor personnel. Specialty items such as wedding cakes, sheet cakes, designer cupcakes, etc. are included in this category.</p>
<p>c. Ready to heat/ready to eat: Items which are prepared by vendor for immediate consumption by the patron, or which have already been cooked and can be reheated for use by patrons. Examples include rotisserie chicken, side dishes, meal solutions, sandwiches, soups, etc.</p>
<p>d. Sushi: Items which are primarily made up of cold rice dressed with vinegar, formed into any of various shapes, and garnished especially with bits of raw seafood or vegetables. Typically these items will be prepared in store, by trained personnel.</p>
<p>e. Non Random Weight: Items which arrive at the store pre-packaged by manufacturer require no additional preparation, for immediate purchase by patrons. These items usually have a manufacturer provided UPC code. Examples include imported, local and ethnic grocery like items.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to twenty-five (25) single-sided pages, Times Roman, size twelve (12)&nbsp;font, and one inch margins.</p>
<p>Contact with the individual DeCA stores is prohibited. In the event that a vendor has any specific questions regarding this initiative, they are asked to refer those questions, in writing, by the cut-off date, to the email address shown below.</p>
<p>The deadline for the receipt of questions and/or comments is the close of business (COB),&nbsp;February 19, 2013. Written queries will be answered by the appropriate subject matter expert. Responses to all questions submitted will be consolidated and posted to www.fbo.gov, no later March 14, 2013. Refer all questions and/or comments via email to Mr. David Leffert, Commissary Management Specialist, Defense Commissary Agency, <a href="mailto:david.leffert@deca.mil">david.leffert@deca.mil</a>.</p>

Fort Hood trains, maintains and sustains a corps-level headquarters, two army division level headquarters, a corps sustainment command, six brigade combat teams (BCTs), five other brigade-size formations and numerous other major organizations. Fort Hood exists to train its assigned units, as a mobilization station for Army Reserve and National Guard units and as a strategic power projection platform. The installation serves a wide variety of tenant organizations and ensures the highest quality of life support for a diverse community of over 297,000 soldiers, family members and retirees. With 45,414 assigned soldiers or airmen and 8,909 civilian employees, Fort Hood occupies 335 square miles of Bell and Coryell Counties, 60 miles north of Austin and 50 miles south of Waco. Seven surrounding cities with a regional population of 335,000 are partnered with and provide substantial quality of life support to Fort Hood. The Army has consistently demonstrated its commitment to long term infrastructure improvements at Fort Hood. These include 98 new or renovated barracks, state of the art command and control facilities, the 21st-century Krueger Soldier Development / Education Center, the one stop Copeland Soldier Service Center, an aggressive range modernization program and modern Installation support facilities. The Installation encompasses 214,968 acres; 136,094 acres are used for maneuver, 63,000 acres as a Live Fire Impact area and 15,874 acres for the installation's Cantonment Areas. The largest single on-post training segment is called the Western Maneuver Area, an area stretching 20 miles from north to south and from the western boundary of the Installation eastward to the live fire impact area. Fort Hood is capitalized to fully support current and future Army, joint and combined force mission requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological and Research (NCTR) requirement for accessory items to be used on existing Vitrocell 6-well Stainless Steel Exposure Modules.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) certified companies. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requires accessory items to be used on existing Vitrocell 6-well Stainless Steel Exposure Modules. The project involves exposing AMES test bacteria cultures, and cell cultures used in the Micronucleus (MN) assay, Mouse Lymphoma assay (MLA) and a 3D human airway model to tobacco smoke generated by a Jaeger-Baumgartner 30-port Cigarette Smoking Machine. This equipment will be used to conduct the studies outlined above to provide needed data to determine the risks associated with exposure to specific levels of whole tobacco smoke, thus filling in data-gaps that exist in risk assessment models. In addition, the facilities will be able to quantify the toxicity of whole cigarette smoke, and will provide the FDA/CTP with data regarding the relative toxic and genotoxic potency of tobacco products.</p>
<p>1. The government requires a dilution air system attached to the five (5) Vitrocell SS exposure modules. The system shall provide diluted clean air with for dose-response measure from tobacco generated smoke in a freely defined dilution range of 0.1-15 liter air/min. The system module and all accessories shall allow dose regulation via dilution, exposure time and/or flow rate.<br />2. Along with the dilution system the government requires a rack system for the SS exposure modules so that tobacco generated smoke shall be delivered to each compartment for cells or bacteria with a controlled flow rate ranging from 2 - 150 mL/min. The rack system is a way of connecting up to 8 of the Vitrocell SS modules to minimize the distance the air/smoke must travel to deliver the required exposure.<br />3. Integrated heating system to maintain the ideal temperature consistent with the culture of the cells or bacteria (must not require an incubator to maintain the temperature).<br />4. Microbalance and controller which allows exposure system to have the option to measure the dose online in real time using a quartz crystal microbalance which can be set instead of a culture insert/petri dish; this feature must be possible with each single compartment for cell culture insert / petri dish.<br />5. Flow controller for the SS module to allow the culture medium supply to be static, intermittent or continuous between 0-10L/min.<br />6. Installation of items on the Vitrocell Stainless Steel Exposure system to include installation material and travel.<br />7. Service Agreement to include complete exposure system up to eight (8) modules with one scheduled preventative maintenance visit per contract year.</p>
<p><br />Place of Performance<br />3900 NCTR Road<br />Jefferson, AR 72079</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered products/services and components meet the technical requirements identified above. Though the target audience is small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer all interested parties may respond. At a minimum, responses shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Business name, DUNS number, business address, business website, business size status (i.e., SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, LB), point of contact name, mailing address (if different from business address), phone number and email address (Provide this same information if responding to provide a product manufactured by another firm);<br />&bull; Sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products and services meet or exceed above specifications. All descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service/product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement.<br />&bull; Three (3) years of past performance information for the manufacture and/or sale of same or substantially similar items to include date of sale, description, dollar value, client name, client address, client point of contact name, client point of <br />contact mailing address (if different from that provided for client), client point of contact phone number, client point of contact email address, and name of the <br />manufacturer (to include DUNS number and size status) if not the respondent.<br />&bull; If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement.<br />&bull; The offeror may provide information on multiple types of service agreements plans available and pricing of each. <br />&bull; Applicability of the Service Contract Act (SCA).<br />&bull; Provide information if any of these specifications are too restrictive. No response will be considered that the listed specifications are adequate in a competitive environment. <br />&bull; If a large business, identify the subcontracting opportunities that would exist for small business concerns; and <br />&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing is encouraged.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, not identified in the response.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of providing: <strong>TruSeq Custom Oligo Set (Specified Brand Name: Illumina) </strong></p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] <strong>under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541711, with a small business size standard of 500 Employees. </strong></p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide Good and Services as below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The following Reagents for this Requirement</span></strong>:</p>
<p>1. TruSeq Custom Oligo Set, Catalog Number: FC-121-0200, Units: 1, 152 Samples.<br />2. Shipping and Insurance.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium.</p>
<p>While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. When an investigator wishes to study only selected genes or genomic regions it is more cost-effective and efficient to perform targeted sequencing. The goal is to discover as many variants linked to fanco anemia as possible. The investigator has a collection of many hundreds of samples, so the system must be compatible with large sample numbers. TruSeq Custom Enrichment is an in-solution capture assay for targeting and enriching user-selected human genomic regions of ~500 kb - 25 Mb of cumulative DNA per sample for fully-customized re-sequencing. The assay is ideal for targeting specific genomic content, such as variant validation, examination of specific genes in pathways, or as a follow-up to GWAS.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor's Reagents shall be capable sequencing on the Contractor's DNA sequencers.<br />&bull; The Contractor's Reagents shall be pre-configured into appropriate aliquots for construction of 96 barcoded libraries compatible with the Contractor's DNA sequencers.<br />&bull; Reagents must allow for multiplexing PCR reactions to 96x and must include adapters and shall be compatible with Contractor's DNA sequencers.<br />&bull; The Contractor's targeted design must provide &gt;95% coverage of target region.</p>
<p><strong>Government Responsibilities</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; The Government will store reagents at stated temperature by the Contractor.<br />Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:<br />Not Applicable<br />Program Management and Control Requirements: <br />Not Applicable<br />Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Upon arrival of reagents to destination, the package and contents must be undamaged.<br />&bull; Upon arrival of reagents to destination, the package and contents must be at proper temperature.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address). Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Dorothy Maxwell, Contract Specialist, at maxwelld@mail.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by February 8, 2013 7:30 AM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-389-2262<br />Name:	Self Stick Rectangular Flag, "Sign Here", 1.0" X 1.75", Yellow, 100 Flags per pack<br />Description:	Self-stick rectangular flag with "Sign Here", 1.0" X 1.75", Yellow, 100 Flags per pack. UOI is PG. PG = 100 Flags</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-01-389-2262<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	MMM680SH2; MMM680HVSHR; MMM680SH12</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 19, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE: No later than noon (EST) on March 1, 2013
DESCRIPTION Request for Information (RFI) - Components and/or technologies supporting enhanced stand-off distances and message effectiveness during bi-directional, respective native language verbal communications with indigenous personnel at extended open space range using a single up-range Security Forces field deployable system.
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, Innovation and Discovery Competency (71000) is seeking information on commercially-available, and/or emerging components or technologies supporting development, integration, and/or procurement of a field deployable system capable of enabling bi-directional free speech between indigenous individuals and NATO language Security Forces at safe stand-off distances.  The goal is to enhance Security Force personal safety two-fold by: a) enabling bi-directional verbal engagement with indigenous individuals at enhanced stand-off distances, and b) to provide enhanced mutual understanding/communications by providing autonomous, real-time voice translation between both parties in their respective or native/local dialects while at safe stand-off distances.  The primary use case of the deployed system is for communicating (conversing) with specific individuals or a small number of closely spaced individuals at distances in excess of 30M.
The RFI results will be used to assess the emerging 'state-of-the-art' and/or availability for each of the 3 major systems components necessary to obtain the desired deployment system functionality and/or if the desired functionality is currently available.  To be determined future efforts may be established to procure, integrate, or develop the desired features in a field deployable format.
These major components are: 1) down-range voice projection or hailing, 2) down-range voice capture or extended range, narrow field microphone, and 3) an autonomous, real-time speech-to-speech multi-language translation module.  The desired feature sets for each of these sub-systems is as follows;
LONG-HAULER:  The purpose of the long-distance hailer system is to project the verbal response generated by the Security Force personnel down-range to the indigenous subject.  The sub-system must allow for operation by non-hearing protected Security Forces personnel and to intelligibly project their verbal responses at the desired distances.  Additionally, it is desirable that the output be of a sufficiently narrow field to illuminate only the desired/intended indigenous recipients.
NARROW FIELD, LONG-RANGE MICROPHONE:  This sub-system forms the down-range 'input' side of the speech translation module.  The requirement is to remotely sense and capture indigenous speech with sufficient signal-to-noise and frequency response to support high-fidelity free speech translation.  The technologies projected are open, but it highly desired that they be supportive of a single sensor placement, up/down-range personnel safe, and capable of targeting user specified individuals at distance.
SPEECH-TO-SPEECH TRANSLATION:  As previously stated this sub-system needs to be stand-alone, autonomous and capable of operating with the signal-to-noise and frequency response provided by the long-range microphone sub-system.  In addition, it is desirable that this sub-system be capable of interpreting and translating to local indigenous dialects, in addition to more common regional language.   Ideally this sub-system can autonomously identify from a small list of local dialect possibilities either participant's spoken language or local dialect and translate between them.  Use of a written meta-language to aid in translation could also be advantageous for alternative verbal response interfaces (i.e., text).
SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOUGHT INCLUDES: 1. Company or organization information, including name, address, URL, revenue, and number of employees. 2. Whether the organization is a manufacturer, distributor, or developer. 3. A point of contact for follow-up information, and the point of contact's phone number and e-mail address. 4. Product/sub-system name and succinct description. 4. Brief description of (sub-) system's features, capabilities, performance, and availability. 5. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) with a brief description of (sub-) system state of readiness or availability. This should include statements on demonstrated or evaluated performance. 6. Cost information such as purchase price and General Services Administration (GSA) schedule information if available.  If an emerging technology, please provide a project/ROM estimate as to additional development or integration costs as well as projected (sub-) system costs.
SUBMITTALS The technical point of contact is Curtis White at curtis.d.white1@navy.mil.

<DESC>The objective is to develop the computational tools necessary to accurately predict the behavior and the life of SiC/SiC CMC for gas turbine engine applications. In particular, tools are required that can account for coupled environmental and mechanical damage as a function of the microstructure (e.g., fibers, fiber coatings, matrix, tow architecture, porosity, defects, holes, ply drops, layup) and applied loading conditions. The models developed should be able to be sufficiently calibrated with coupon data fro component level analysis. Tools should be verified and validated with a component or subcomponent in a turbine engine representative application environment.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 in conjunction with Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is SP3300-13-Q-0046.<br /><br />This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-65 effective 29 Jan 2013, and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DPN 20121231 (Effective 31 Dec 2012) edition, and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) Current to Revision 5, and PROCLTR 2013-30. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.<br /><br />This solicitation is 100% Set Aside for Small Business; the NAICS code for this procurement is 315210. The size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees.
<p>The Security and Emergency Services Susquehanna, Fire Department located at DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA has a requirement to procure fourteen (14) sets of Janesville V-Force turnout gear/personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>The price for each set of turnout gear/personal protective equipment shall include custom fitting at the Government site, New Cumberland, PA 17070, by the contractors' sales representative with sizing gear.</p>
<p>Each set of turnout gear/personal protective equipment shall consist of the following:</p>
<p>1) One (1) Janesville 32" Male V-Force PBI Matrix Bi-Swing Coat, Black - Part Number CVBM-32, per the specification contained in Attachment 1 to the solicitation<br />2) One (1) pair of Janesville V-Force PBI Matrix Pants without Belt, Black - Part Number PVFM/F, per the specification contained in Attachment 1 to the solicitation<br />3) One (1) set of Janesville V-Force Suspenders, 42" (Reg.), Red w/Black Padding, Metal loops Front and Back - Part Number SR842M</p>
<p>Specifications for the turnout gear/personal protective equipment are contained in Attachment 1 to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to quote a Firm Fixed Price to supply fourteen (14) sets of Janesville V-Force turnout gear/personal protective equipment, each set as described above, and provide individual on-site sizing of the turnout gear for the responder, as follows:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 (Firm Fixed Price CLIN) - Set of Janesville V-Force turnout gear/personal protective equipment. Each set shall consist of one (1) black coat, one (1) pair of black pants, and one (1) set of suspenders per the attached specification. Each set shall be custom fit for the responder and individual on-site sizing must be performed by the contractor. Quantity 14 sets @ tiny_mce_marker______________ per set = tiny_mce_marker______________<br /><br />NOTE: This solicitation is issued as a Brand Name Requirement for the Janesville V-Force Bi-Swing Coat, Pants, and Suspenders described above and in the attached specification. The justification for this Brand Name Requirement is as follows (reference FAR 11.105(a)(1), FAR 13.106-1(b), and DFARS 211.105): The Janesville V-Force brand of turnout gear/personal protective equipment offers safety features that are only available in this brand: a moisture barrier that has proven, during live fire training, to offer the most protection from steam burns by wicking the most moisture away from the responder; and ventilated reflective trim which adds to the garments' ability to release body heat. The components and design of the Janesville V-Force brand of turnout gear/personal protective equipment have proven to offer superior protection while providing the best mobility and dexterity during rigorous testing. In order to ensure maximum safety, the coat, pants, and suspenders must be of uniform specification (i.e. all the same brand). This personal protective equipment has been standardized for all responders and is the result of safety negotiations and extensive research conducted by the International Association of Firefighters Local F-221 Safety Committee and FSSF management.</p>
<p>Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1103. Registration may be done online at: www.sam.gov.<br /><br />Contractors are advised that any and all questions concerning this solicitation must be sent in writing to the Contracting Office at DLA Distribution, New Cumberland, PA. Questions may be sent via email to daniel.herring@dla.mil or faxed to 717-770-5689.</p>

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (May 2011). See attachment for full text and instructions for completion.</p>

In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.<br />SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p><br />A CONTINUING RESOLUTION, also known as a "CR" is legislation enacted by congress that continues funding for specific ongoing activities if the fiscal year appropriation has not been enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>"Due to the Continuing Resolution, funds are presently available through March 27, 2013 (H.J. RES.117). The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond March 27, 2013. If funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance beyond the above cited date, the Contractor will receive notification in writing by the Contracting Officer."</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The Arizona Army National Guard seeks a self-propelled vehicle to move a skid-type helicopter, in and around parking and maintenance hangar facilities.  Gross weight of the helicopters will be up to 9,500 pounds.  Although the principle operating environment will be in and around a developed airfield facility at Marana, Arizona, the Government seeks a product that is also capable of operating on unimproved areas (e.g., gravel, grass) and also under winter weather conditions (to include snow and ice).   <br>  <br> Electric/battery powered motor, with sufficient torque and wheel traction to be capable of crossing hangar rails and steps, along with sloping grade.  Intended operating environment will not always be level or hard-stand quality.  Safety system needs to activate an emergency braking system in the event of unit hydraulic pressure failure, and accommodate an emergency towing system. <br>  <br> Electrical system needs to include an appropriate auxiliary power unit (APU) with standard aviation receptacle and converter (step down to appropriate aircraft voltage).  Night lighting system is preferred to facilitate safety during night operations. <br>  <br> Primary intended helicopter will be the LUH-72.  Current maintenance requirements have created a more labor intensive situation for routine movement of the aircraft.  The Government seeks an alternative that will allow a single operator to reposition the helicopter, in or out of the hangar. <br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NIHLM2013669 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541712 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees. This solicitation is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.
<p><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM), on behalf of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases (NIDDK) intends to procure a service contract that can provide measurement of the concentration and shear dependence of the viscosity of highly concentrated solutions of individual proteins, individual polymers, mixtures of proteins and mixtures of proteins and polymers.</p>
<p>Services to be performed:<br />The Contractor shall: <br />1. Prepare highly concentrated solutions of various proteins and mixtures of proteins under conditions of varying pH and ionic strength, as specified by NIDDK. <br />2. Perform measurements of the concentration dependence of the viscosity of these solutions.<br />3. Provide detailed documentation of all preparations and measurements, and complete data obtained from each measurement.<br />4. Contribute to analysis of the results as necessary to be performed: Solutions will be prepared and measurements performed on a continuous basis during the term of the contract. Reports of progress will be provided at least once weekly by the Contractor, and consultations between NIDDK and the Contractor will be held frequently via oral or written communication, so that results may be discussed and experimental goals and protocols revised if necessary in light of results obtained.</p>
<p>Special equipment or procedures to be used: <br />The Contractor will perform the requested measurements using a viscometer/rheometer specifically designed to carry out measurements of the type that we wish to perform. The amount of sample required to perform the requested measurements is less than one tenth of that required to perform equivalent measurements using commercially available instrumentation. In addition, the unique automated dilution system incorporated into this special viscometer enables a complete profile of viscosity as a function of concentration to be obtained about twenty times more rapidly than an equivalent set of experiments can be performed using a conventional viscometer. Both of these unique capabilities are essential to performance of the requested measurements within the time frame of the requested contract. Some of the proteins that NIDDK seeks to characterize are engineered monoclonal antibodies that are available only in quantities that are too small to characterize via conventional means. Results obtained from the instrument have been validated by comparison of results obtained for small quantities of several proteins and polymers using the custom viscometer with published results obtained using much larger quantities of the same proteins and polymers in commercially available viscometers.</p>
<p>Specifications for measurement:<br />1. Total sample required for an entire concentration series: &lt;1 ml of the highest concentration solution (up to 200 g/l)<br />2. Precision of concentration determination: better than 3%<br />3. Accuracy of viscosity measurement: better than 3% of measured value<br />4. Precision of viscosity measurement: better than 0.1%<br />5. Range of viscosity measurement: 1cP to 1000 cP<br />6. Range of applied shear: 10 s-1 - 104 s-1<br />7. Temperature control: better than &plusmn; 0.5oC<br />8. Viscosity of each solution must be measured at &gt;25 concentrations obtained via serial dilutions<br />9. Optional inline measurement of concentration via absorbance<br />10. Entire series of viscosity measurements performed on a single sample at different concentrations must be completed within 3 hours to avoid sample degradation.<br />11. Measurements must be made by staff experienced in the preparation and safe handling of valuable biologically derived materials, including engineered monoclonal antibodies.<br /><br />Expected deliverables, if any<br />Data obtained from experiments, complete documentation of all procedures performed in conduct of the experiments.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: February 2013 - July 2013</p>
<p><br />POTENTIAL SOURCES SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE:<br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

However, it does require that the Contractor shall be registered in SAM prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>

The Government intends to issue a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Sole Source purchase order with Germane Systems, CAGE 1VQH4, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

The basis for restricting competition is that the storage media must be identical to the tactical storage media currently used aboard United States submarines, and must specifically mirror the tactical suite located on Virginia Class submarines and test bay 14 located in the CCSL at NUWCDIVNPT.
   If the media purchased is not identical to tactical shipboard storage media currently in place then formal compatibility testing already performed will not be valid.  Storage media provided by another vendor would require additional compatibility testing resulting in significant cost to the Government that would not be recouped through competition and would have adverse impact to the platform schedule.  Germane carrier combo hard drives used in the AN/BYG-1 Combat Control System are manufactured and available solely from Germane Systems. (see redacted SSJ for further details)

This proposed procurement is for 102 sets of Germane Tactical Media as follows: 
Quantity	Part Number	Description
2	71679-01	Germane Carrier Combo  HDD, 3.5IN,  147GB,  15K RPM, SCSI
50	73032-01	Germane Carrier Combo  SSD, 2.5IN,  32GB,  SATA10000
2	73033-01	Germane Carrier Combo  SSD, 2.5IN,  128GB,  SATA10000
4	73035-01	Germane Carrier Combo  HDD, 3.5IN,  2TB,  SATA
8	73034-01	Germane Carrier Combo  HDD, 2.5IN,  500GB,  7.2K RPM, SATA
21	72469-01	Germane Carrier Combo  HDD, 2.5IN Standard,  500GB,  7.2K RPM, SATA
15	73031-01	Germane Carrier Combo  HDD, 2.5IN,  600GB,  10K RPM, SAS

This acquisition is under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 334112.
  The size standard is 1000 employees.  Required delivery is 42 days after award, F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI.  

Interested parties may identify an alternate product by submitting a capability statement detailing the alternates ability to perform as a substitute to the Germane drives specified above. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, and DFARS 52.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items apply.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.  All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines.  Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200039 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that a competitive order shall be awarded as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Honeywell Intl Inc DBA Honeywell. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. It is the Government's belief that Honeywell Intl Inc DBA Honeywell is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.</p>
<p>Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />SECTION C - DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />FOR<br />MILLING MACHINES AND TRAINING</p>
<p>C.1 INTRODUCTION <br />This requirement is for two vertical milling machines and associated training for the 22nd Maintenance Battalion, General Support Company, Support Plt, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The milling machines are required to repair the transmissions of Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAV).</p>
<p>C.2 BACKGROUND <br />The Support Platoon is responsible to repair the AAV transmissions. The machine shop can repair the transmissions, in most cases, with the proper machine tools and software. The vertical milling machine is required to perform the complex machining repairs on the AAV transmissions. Such repairs cannot be completed in a convenient fashion without the Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. For the individual Marine to write the code required to perform the manufacture/repair of several different types of repair parts would take weeks. The CAM software will increase productivity by allowing the Marine machinist to set up and program the milling machine within a day.</p>
<p>C.3 SCOPE OF WORK <br />The increased capability that the milling machine would bring will provide the Marine machinist in the Intermediate Maintenance Activity the tools needed to maintain the advanced vehicle and weapon platforms the Marine Corps is moving towards. As the technological advancements in weapons, armor and transportation assets continues to keep our fighting forces on the cutting edge, so too must our Machinists have the ability to program complex parts and maintain the tolerance required to produce, repair and fabricate the parts needed by the war fighters.</p>

<p><br />PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:<br />Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the <br />Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

Submitted proposals must reflect Technical, Past Performance, and Price as described in Section M. It is solely the Contractor's responsibility to ensure proposals are received within the required timeframe.</p>
<p><br />SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p><br />M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror that possesses a relevant, satisfactory performance record. In accordance with FAR Part 12.206 Past Performance will be evaluated. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror when the offeror's past performance record demonstrates anything other than satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and select an offer based on the initial evaluation of proposals received in response to the solicitation. Therefore, offerors are cautioned that their initial proposals should contain their best terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, the evaluation criteria that will be used for/applied to all proposals received in response to this solicitation are: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency. All timely proposals will be evaluated and an award will be made without discussion with vendors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>M.1.1 FACTOR #1 - TECHNICAL. A mere statement that the vendor will meet the Government requirement is NOT sufficient. The proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror possesses the capability required to successfully perform the requirements of the solicitation. Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using non-cost/price factors. Technical capability will be evaluated on contract requirements listed in Sections B and C of this solicitation (See Section L for instructions to offerors ).</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated first on price. The lowest price offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability and satisfactory past performance. When an offer is determined to technically acceptable with satisfactory past performance, no further evaluations will be conducted and award will be made to that offeror.</p>
<p><br />M.1.2 FACTOR #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE. Offeror(s) shall submit information as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.2 in this solicitation. Information provided in the proposal shall include similar contracts with Federal, State, and local governments, as well as commercial businesses. Similar contracts are defined as those similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to this procurement.</p>
<p>M.1.2.1 Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the offeror's, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' demonstrated past performance in delivering quality services and in meeting schedule requirements on similar programs. The performance risk assessment will address the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the contract requirements based on relevant past performance. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. Problems not addressed by the offeror will be considered to still exist.</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated to the extent to which they demonstrate satisfactory performance on contracts or subcontracts currently ongoing or completed within the last three (3) years. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in evaluating the offeror's past performance. Past performance is an indicator of how current and/or previous customers assess contractor performance under a specific contract performed for them and address the full range of all functions required to make any contractual relationship work. Successful past performance indicates that a contractor understands and has the resources to successfully execute a contract; however, it does not necessarily mean a contractor has the resources and skills necessary to perform the specific work requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance will be based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The evaluation will include demonstrated past performance in quality of product or service, schedule, business relations, and customer satisfaction. The following table identifies the adjectival ratings and descriptions utilized in rating past performance history:</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION<br />Satisfactory Performance MET contractual requirements. <br />Unsatisfactory Performance DID NOT MEET contractual requirements.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance will receive a "neutral" rating, that will have neither a positive nor negative effect. If there is no record of relevant past performance, offerors must affirmatively state this.</p>
<p>M.1.3 FACTOR #3 - PRICE. Offerors shall submit price/proposal as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.3 in this solicitation. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>

<p>6. Basis for Award. The 802nd CONS will issue a purchase order to the vendor who is determined to have quoted the lowest evaluated price to the government. Award will be made to the responsible vendor who quoted the lowest evaluated price. Since award will be based on initial responses, quoters are highly encouraged to quote their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.</p>
<p>7. Best Value Determination. The technically acceptable, lowest priced quote will be determined to represent the best value. Technical acceptability will be determined by an evaluation of the quoted requirements that meet the technical criteria that is contained in the solicited item description. If the lowest priced submission does not meet the technical criteria described in the solicited item description, the government reserves the right to evaluate the next lowest priced submissions until it has determined a technically acceptable submission. The evaluation will stop at the point when the government determines a quoter to be technically acceptable with the lowest evaluated price, because that quote will represent the best value. Contingent upon a determination of contractor responsibility, award will be made to that quoter without further evaluation of other quoters. Award will be made to the responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among technically acceptable quotes.</p>
<p>8. Questions and Answers: Questions shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Cathy Garcia at cathy.garcia@us.af.mil before the government cutoff date 25 January 2013, 1200 CST. All answers will be posted on Fed Biz Ops on 30 January 2013.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

If available, submit Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluations ratings.  2.) For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs).    <br>        <br>    a.	ACASS Evaluations    <br>        <br>    Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.    <br>        <br>    There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.    <br>        <br>    b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)    <br>        <br>    The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.    <br>        <br>    Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).    <br>        <br>    c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance    <br>        <br>    The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.    <br>        <br>    While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.    <br>        <br>    d.	The Government will give the awardee(s) an Option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.     <br>         <br>    Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions    <br>        <br>        <br>    i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):    <br>        <br>    	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.    <br>        <br>    	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.      <br>        <br>    	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.      <br>        <br>    	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.    <br>    	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award.    <br>        <br>    Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.    <br>        <br>    ii.	Definitions:    <br>        <br>    Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.    <br>        <br>    Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.    <br>        <br>    Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.    <br>        <br>    Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information    <br>        <br>    i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.  Part I, Part II and Sections of the submitted SF330 information (reference SF330 instructions for definitions of Part I, Part II and Sections) of each copy shall be separated by tabs (dividers) and clearly marked.  Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II.    <br>        <br>    FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.

After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.    <br>        <br>    ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.

If available, submit Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluations ratings.  2.) For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs).     <br>          <br>     a.	ACASS Evaluations     <br>          <br>     Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.     <br>          <br>     There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.     <br>          <br>     b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)     <br>          <br>     The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.     <br>          <br>     Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).     <br>          <br>     c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance     <br>          <br>     The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.     <br>          <br>     While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.     <br>          <br>     d.	The Government will give the awardee(s) an Option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.      <br>           <br>     Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions     <br>          <br>          <br>     i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):     <br>          <br>     	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.     <br>          <br>     	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.       <br>          <br>     	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.       <br>          <br>     	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.     <br>     	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award.     <br>          <br>     Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.     <br>          <br>     ii.	Definitions:     <br>          <br>     Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.     <br>          <br>     Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.     <br>          <br>     Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.     <br>          <br>     Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information     <br>          <br>     i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.

After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.     <br>          <br>     ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be up to two possible small business contracts awarded as a result of negotiations.

NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE PREPARED OR PROVIDED.   <br>      <br>   Announcement Section A - General Information   <br>      <br>   i.	Solicitation W9128F-13-R-0019 is for UNRESTRICTED PARTICIPATION under NAICS Code 541330 having a size standard of $14 Million Dollars.   A firm's size status at the time response is received is subject to Contracting Office's verification (through the System for Award Management (SAM) database, or by other means).  The Government intends, after successful negotiations with the most qualified firms, to award **one (1)** IDIQ contract for Petrographic and Advanced Concrete Technology Investigations for Concrete Military Airfield Pavements at DOD locations Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS) Worldwide.  Firms responding to this announcement must, if work is on a military installation, be able to pass all security checks, have proper insurance and meet all other regulatory requirements necessary to gain access to military installations.  Contracts will be available for use by Department of Defense (DOD) agencies Worldwide as assigned by the USACE Transportation Systems Center of Expertise.   <br>      <br>   ii.	Work under a resultant contract from this announcement will include Petrographic and Advanced Concrete Technology Investigations for Concrete Military Airfield and Roadway Pavements, and Forensic Investigations related to Concrete Military Pavements at multiple DOD locations.   The types of services may include, but are not limited to:     <br>      <br>   (1) Testing Services.  The contractor will conduct routine testing of materials used in production of concrete used on military airfields.  As a minimum, the contractor must be able to conduct the required testing of ASTM C 295, C 457, and C 856, and the deleterious material requirements of UFGS 32 13 11 completely in-house.  Paragraph 1.2 of UFGS 32 13 11 includes a complete list of tests and material requirements that may need to be evaluated in the production of military airfield concrete.  Any of these testing services or testing to determine compliance with a material specification may be required under this contract except for NRMCA QC3 and CTM 526.  The contractor will have to be capable of testing and evaluating all requirements in this list but may subcontract testing.     <br>   (2) Forensic Investigations and Expert Services.  The contractor must be capable of conducting advanced investigations to ascertain causes or field problems.  This encompasses a wide range of potential issues.  Examples of past investigations of this type include alkali-silica related problems, expansive reactions from sulfate attack on lime- and cement-stabilized materials, recycled concrete, and waste materials, inadequate air-entrainment, localized durability problems, aggregate deterioration producing plastic fines, external chemical attack on concrete, alkali carbonate related problems, blisters, de-laminations, pop-outs, cracking and spalling..  The contractor must demonstrate past experience on forensic investigations of these types of problems.  The contractor will also be expected to provide expert services that may range the gamut from court testimony, participation in dispute resolution, to expert advice on UFGS and UFC documents related to military concrete airfield pavements.   <br>   Announcement Section B - Selection Criteria (Evaluation Factors) and Related Submission Requirements   <br>      <br>   i.

If available, submit Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluations ratings.  2.) For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs).   <br>      <br>   a.	ACASS Evaluations   <br>      <br>   Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.   <br>      <br>   There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for  quote mark Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative quote mark  access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.   <br>      <br>   b.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)   <br>      <br>   The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the  quote mark Packages quote mark  tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.   <br>      <br>   Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).   <br>      <br>   c.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance   <br>      <br>   The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.   <br>      <br>   While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.   <br>      <br>   d.	 The Government will give the awardee an option to work overseas.  Please advise if you would be interested in OCONUS work.   <br>      <br>   Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions   <br>      <br>      <br>   i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an  quote mark offer quote mark ,  quote mark proposal quote mark , or  quote mark response quote mark  - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):   <br>      <br>   	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.   <br>      <br>   	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.     <br>      <br>   	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.     <br>      <br>   	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.   <br>   	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for any factor may not be considered for award.   <br>      <br>   Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.   <br>      <br>   ii.	Definitions:   <br>      <br>   Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.   <br>      <br>   Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A  quote mark significant weakness quote mark  in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.   <br>      <br>   Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.   <br>      <br>   Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information   <br>      <br>   i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.  Part I, Part II and Sections of the submitted SF330 information (reference SF330 instructions for definitions of Part I, Part II and Sections) of each copy shall be separated by tabs (dividers) and clearly marked.  Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II.   <br>      <br>   FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.  FOR SUBCONTRACTORS/SUBCONSULTANTS, PROVIDE THESE FIRMS' DUNS NUMBERS AND CAGE CODES IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK C, BOX 9.   <br>      <br>   All proposers, including joint-ventures, must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM)  at https://www.sam.gov and have completed their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) section.   <br>      <br>   All proposals submitted will become, upon receipt, the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.   <br>      <br>   ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF 330 offers received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be one contract awarded as a result of negotiations.  The contract will have $3 million capacity and a period of performance of 5 years.    <br>      <br>   iii.	Completed SF 330 information must reach the Contracting Division Offices not later than 2:00 p.m. (Central/local time) on Friday, 01-Mar-2013.

On the date specified and for thirty (30) minutes prior to the specified time, a Contracting representative will be in the lobby of the building at the above address to receive offers. Containers (e.g. envelopes, packages, boxes) will be screened for security purposes.  Hand-carried means the individual must be able to carry on their person.  If due to size or volume, packages or boxes need to be wheeled in on a cart or dolly, you will be required to go to the dock area located on the northeast side of the facility. After inspection and screening, you will be allowed in the building after presenting valid photo identification.  At the offer due date/time specified above, it will be announced that receipt of proposals is closed. Official time will be established by a clock designated by the Contracting representative receiving hand-carried proposals, to be located in the area of proposals being received.  Recent terrorist threats have resulted in more time-consuming sign-in and escort procedures and may impact the timely delivery of offers.  This instruction shall also apply to those proposals delivered through a delivery or parcel service.  NOTE:  No parking on the street in front of the facility entrances will be allowed.  Passenger vehicles will need to locate parking meters or parking garages before delivering proposals.  Delivery trucks must go to the dock.

<DESC>This is a small business set-aside procurement for RCRA Facility Investigations. The purpose of the RFI is to obtain information to fully characterize the nature, extent and rate of migration of releases of hazardous waste or constituents and to interpret this information to determine whether interim corrective measures and/or a Corrective Measures Study may be necessary. Prior to conducting the investigation, the owner or operator (Anniston Army Depot) will in most cases be directed, through a permit or enforcement order, to submit a written plan (the RFI Work Plan) that should propose, in detail, the manner in which the investigation will be conducted. Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) would receive notice from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) that a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) is required.  The RFI field work shall be completed within 180 days of ADEM notification to ANAD unless other actions have been approved by ADEM.  A work plan will be developed for the project including a site-specific health and safety plan, as well as a quality assurance project plan.  The work plan will be submitted to the Contracting officer within 30 days after the award of the task order.  Work will not commence until the approval has been given. North American Industry Classification System Code is 562910; size standard is $14 million.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(a)(7) and 14.205-1(c); therefore hardcopies will not be provided.  Proposals submitted must be in electronic format as stated in the solicitation.  Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the Internet: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ (ASFI).  Estimated issue date is 6 September 2012.  CAUTION:  This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is, in fact, unable to maintain a bidder mailing list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above Internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.

<DESC>Questions and Answers - Thirteenth Round. Answers are in response to Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U Market Survey 5281-1 posted on 25 May 2012. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Question #1 -  quote mark XXXXXX respectfully request all applicable documents related to the Procurement of the Tactical Power Supply (W15P7T12RA307).   <br>  <br>  Additionally, there appears to be some confusion if in fact this procurement is or is not a Small Business Set Aside.  We have reviewed Government answers to this question previously; however based off of Government answers, we cannot definitively determine if this is a Small Business Set Aside once released.  Can the Government please advise?  Thank you. quote mark  <br>  <br> Answer #1- The Government is releasing the drawings to all inquires; however, please note the release of drawings by the Government does not qualify your business as a small business under the NAICS code selected for this procurement. As previously answered in Q&A 6th Round posted on FedBizOpps August 16, 2012,  quote mark Only you can make that determination if your company meets the small business size standards for NAICS 335999.  If your company does not meet the small business size standards requirement for Tactical Power Supplies, and you would like to participate in this requirement, in accordance with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting, one option would be is to team as a subcontractor with a small business, with the small business working as the prime contractor. quote mark   It is important to note that, should you make the determination that your company qualifies for the NAICS code size standard, you will be required to certify to this effect in the representations and certifications that are part of the solicitation documentation to be submitted. <br>  <br> Furthermore, as previously answered in Q&A 10th round posted on FedBizOpps December 3, 2012, question #4, Tactical Power Supplies remains a 100% small business set aside. This will be Full and Open competition after exclusion of sources, which means all responsible sources which meet certain criteria, such as business size, are permitted to compete.  Also, please see the amended synopsis, posted on November 16, 2012 to the FedBizOpps website.  This synopsis cites the small business set aside annotation. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Question #2  -  quote mark I left you a voice mail this AM regarding your anticipated release date for the following solicitation.  (Tactical Power Supplies  PP6224DU  and  PP2953EU) <br>  <br> https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=0daa8a72a0a800827734c05d96f74533&tab=core&_cview=1  <br>  <br> Any update to anticipated solicitation release date? <br>  <br> Thank You............appreciate your assistance. quote mark  <br>  <br> Answer #2 - We anticipate having the draft solicitation released by the end of February 2013. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Question #3 -  quote mark Is there a new anticipated Pre-Solicitation date for the Tactical Power Supply for solicitation W15P7T12RA307? quote mark   <br>  <br> Answer #3 - Please see above Question #2. <br>

The intent of this SOW is to provide continuity for performance between the current effort (ending 3/31/13) and a competed effort under DTRA's new CWMD ID/IQ, not yet awarded. <br />Description: The performer will provide modeling and simulation code development, High Level Architecture integration, and event scenario planning and execution in support of J9's comprehensive Real-Time Reachback exercise. This effort will also support TSG J8 operational activities and be fully integrated as an operational component of the staff. <br />This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. However, if a company has reason to believe that it can meet or exceed all the needs of DTRA for this requirement, it may submit documentation to support its claim, i.e., all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by this agency. Any response to this notice must provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br />In the absence of qualified sources, a contract will be awarded under the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures, pursuant to 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. The technologies under development for this effort are at a critical phase, and interrupting development and testing due to the period of performance end would result in unacceptable delays and would not be in the best interest of the Government.<br />Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted. The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.<br />This requirement is subject to the availability of funding.<br />** All qualified sources must respond in writing no later than 5:00 PM (EDT), 6 February 2013, to DTRA/J4CRB, Attn: Mary Kay Chase, mary.chase@dtra.mil. Responses received after this date/time are considered untimely and shall not be considered. Any documentation received shall become the property of the Government.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.002(b)(2)(i) this notice is issued for the purpose of market research to determine what types of businesses are capable and experienced to perform the required work. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THE RFP RESULTING FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE WILL BE ISSUED SEPARATELY AND ADVERTISED on the&nbsp;fbo.gov&nbsp;website <a href="https://www.fbo.gov">https://www.fbo.gov</a>. The information received will be used to determine whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside or full and open competition (unrestricted). The extent of the work is described within the attached statement of work.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is seeking a qualified contractor that can administer the Employment and Training Administration's (ETA) National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), a national random survey of the employment, demographic, and health characteristics of hired crop farm workers. When submitting your response, please provide a list and description of survey research activities to demonstrate how the firm meets the criteria.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has collected information on the demographic and employment characteristics of hired farm workers since the 1940s. Until 1987, the Hired Farm Workforce Survey, a December supplement to the Current Population Survey, was used to collect the information from agricultural employers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture summarized the information in hired farm worker profile reports. In 1988, and as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), the DOL assumed responsibility for collecting this information.<br />To comply with the IRCA mandate, which required annual estimates of the rate at which seasonal agricultural service workers exited the farm labor market, the DOL launched the NAWS, an establishment-based survey of hired crop farm workers. The NAWS questionnaire will be used to collect farm worker demographic, employment, and health information through in-person interviews with farm workers, over the contract period.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the NAWS has changed since the IRCA mandate and annual estimates of the rate at which farm workers leave agriculture are currently not required. As such, farm workers are interviewed only once per year and no attempts are made to locate the same respondent in ensuing interview periods. There are three data collection cycles each year. The start date for the fall, winter-spring, and summer cycle typically occurs between the first and fifteenth of October, February, and June, respectively. Each cycle lasts approximately three months. As such, interviews are conducted on a nearly year-round basis.</p>
<p>Federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as private organizations utilize NAWS findings for a multitude of purposes, such as quantifying and assessing the human resources that are available to agriculture. The findings are also utilized in programs that aim to improve the well being of farm workers and their dependents. At the Federal level, these programs have included the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP), Migrant and Seasonal Head Start, Migrant Education, and Migrant Health.<br />Since 1988, the DOL has collaborated with several Federal agencies to increase the utility of the NAWS, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Administration for Children and Families, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Collaboration with Federal agencies will continue over the contract period.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for carrying out the NAWS and delivering a variety of NAWS-based research products on topics relevant to the ETA and other Federal agencies that administer migrant and seasonal farm worker and related programs. Activities undertaken in this project include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; using Unemployment Insurance data and other information sources to develop a sampling frame of agricultural employers<br />&bull; using farm labor and agricultural production data from various sources to implement a multi-stratified probability-based sampling methodology,<br />&bull; developing and testing survey questions,<br />&bull; training interviewers to randomly select and interview between 1,500 and 3,000 farm workers per year,<br />&bull; developing and managing information for the construction of sampling and post-sampling weights, <br />&bull; managing, safeguarding, and analyzing data for the development and dissemination of research products, such as public-use and restricted-use datasets, reports, and on-line data tables, and <br />&bull; conducting appropriate statistical analysis and summarizing data in written, tabular, and graphic formats to complete deliverables</p>
<p>The performance of the contract will involve access to confidential data, including data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These data are protected by law, including the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act. Protecting these data requires strong safeguards. In this particular situation, the ETA has decided within its discretion and in consultation with the BLS that all personnel who will handle the employer sampling frame data, which the BLS will provide directly to the Contractor, must be 1) direct-hire employees of the Contractor, and 2) agents of the BLS. As such, offerors who may be contemplating contracting portions of the work requirement that involve handling of sampling frame data, such as data collection, are hereby advised that further contracting for such purposes will not be permitted. Restricting the further contracting of tasks that involve handling the confidential data is necessary, after taking into account the safeguards needed to protect the data and the need for administrative convenience in implementing these safeguards.</p>
<p>Although SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND, interest in this Sources Sought announcement is open to all businesses relative to the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The small business size is $14 million. Following the review of the responses to this notice, the Government will determine whether the solicitation for this project will be issued as a set aside or as unrestricted competition.</p>
<p>If applicable, include whether or not your firm is a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small business; woman-owned small business; and/or small disadvantaged business.</p>
<p>All firms responding to this Sources Sought must demonstrate their experience in the aforementioned work. Pertinent factors for consideration of qualifications are the firm's demonstrated experience in the following:</p>
<p>(1) Developing and implementing a statistical methodology for a national random survey of a difficult-to-sample population.<br />(2) Designing a management information system for survey research data.<br />(3) Collecting individual-level data on demographic, employment, and health characteristics through in-person interviews with non-English speaking populations.<br />(4) Obtaining relevant datasets and other information from various sources for the development of sampling frames for establishment-based surveys.<br />(5) Developing interview protocols, including field-level random sampling procedures under various workplace settings, and training interviewers on field procedures.<br />(6) Developing and testing information collection instruments.<br />(7) Interviewing a minimum of 1,500 respondents per year, in-person, throughout the continental United States.<br />(8) Developing documents to support the Paperwork Reduction Act clearance process with the Office of Management and Budget for data collection activities.<br />(9) Obtaining appropriate reviews and approvals for the handling and securing of confidential and personally identifying information in the context of a survey research project, including in the development of public-use and restricted-use datasets.<br />(10) Serving as the lead author for analyzing data and developing draft reports for the government's review and comment, and final reports suitable for public dissemination.</p>

Responses are due February 15, 2013 by 2 p.m. EST. Electronic copies of capability statements are preferred and may be emailed to ETA.Lockbox@dol.gov with DOL131RI20612 NAWS in the Subject field.

The Panel shall establish a short-list of qualified firms. The short-listed Lead Designers and their associated A/E Firms will be notified in writing and requested to submit more detailed information for evaluation in Stage 2.</p>
<p>For Stage 2, the short-list of offerors will assemble their technical teams and submit detailed information as to their proposed team, management plan, and past performance on construction documents.

The Technical Evaluation Panel will not re-score the Stage 1 submissions, but will make a determination of the most highly qualified team consistent with the announced evaluation criteria for Stage 2 and will recommend that offeror for award to the OBO Director.</p>
<p>This is neither a request for proposal, nor a design competition. Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541310, $7 million average.<br />This selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104) and FAR Part 36. After the successful offeror(s) has been selected, the resultant contract award will be dependent on the conclusion of successful negotiations concerning level of effort and price.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award of this contract, the successful offeror must possess, or be eligible to obtain, a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret Facility Clearance (FCL), with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M. Personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) at DOS locations must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). Additionally, the successful offeror selected for contract award must possess, or immediately obtain an Information System (IS) or standalone computer, approved by DSS, for processing classified information. Performance on this contract will require access to the Department's ProjNet-C, for receipt and transmission of all classified information, and a DSS-approved classified IS for processing classified information. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their Stage 2 submissions.</p>
<p>If an uncleared offeror from the Stage 2 short-list is recommended to the Director for selection, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL. Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above FCL requirements. Each entity comprising the joint venture must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.<br />Until the selected firm has been issued at least an Interim Secret FCL, and received DSS approval to safeguard classified documents, they will not receive the classified portions of the RFP requirements package. A period of 90 calendar days, from the date of sponsorship, will be allowed for an uncleared contractor to obtain a Secret FCL. If the firm has not obtained the FCL after 90 days, the Government may terminate negotiations with the offeror, and may move to select another short-listed firm for award.</p>
<p>Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs. Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for an FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level. This process often takes more than the 90 calendar days allotted for clearance. Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.</p>
<p>Certain design team subcontractors/consultants may also require FCLs and personnel security clearances. The Department of State may sponsor one uncleared design subcontractor/ consultant, at the request of an uncleared short-listed firm. Any other uncleared design team subcontractors/consultants must be sponsored by the short-listed firm, only after that firm receives its own FCL.</p>
<p>A copy of the Prohibited Countries List, from which offerors may not choose design team members, can be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed in the last paragraph of this announcement. Additionally, a citizen of Greece, or even a dual US/Greek citizen, may not be a Lead or Principal for the design.</p>
<p>Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to "United States Person" offerors, as defined in the Act. The offeror(s) must complete and submit one copy as part of its qualification package the pamphlet (bound separately), Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (The pamphlet is attached to this announcement and may also be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this notice.)</p>
<p>A firm being considered for award must meet the definition of a "United States person" of P.L. 99-399, Section 402 thereof, as follows: (1) be legally organized in the United States more than five years prior to the issuance of a request for proposal; (2) have its principal place of business in the United States; (3) have performed within the U.S. administrative, technical or professional services similar in complexity, type of construction, and value of the project being solicited; (4) employ U.S. citizens in a least 80 percent of principal management positions in the U.S.; and (5) have existing technical and financial resources in the U.S. to perform the contract. Firms not meeting the "United Sates persons" requirement will not be considered.</p>

The submission shall incorporate tabs to clearly identify the different solicitation requirements. Offerors may find a copy of the SF-330 at the following website: http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/0/21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6/$file/SF%20330.pdf .</p>
