Professions (BHPr) intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Center for Health
Workforce Studies, School of Public Health, State University of New York, Albany (SUNY).  

The purpose of this negotiation is to assess the extent, which schools of public health and the HRSA investment in public health education and training meet the workforce needs of state and local health departments. 

Currently engaged contractually along similar lines with the Government, the Center for Health Workforce Studies of the State University of New York at Albany will conduct a study of the public health workforce, focused on publicly funded health agencies and in particular, on public health physicians, dentists and nurses as well as workers with formal public health training.  SUNY is considered to be the only responsible source capable of providing these services without substantial duplication of cost, which would not be expected to be recovered through competition and under the authority found in 41 USC 253(i), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). 

This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. 

Cite solicitation #04-N230-5050 HA when corresponding.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NECís outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT ñ The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT ñ The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training materials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating countryís export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Governmentís export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating countryís specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), through the Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, a sole source contract to Pennsylvania State University, College of Health and Human Development, Department of Health Policy and Administration, University Park, Pennsylvania, 16802, to design and conduct a survey of 800 frontline supervisors participating in the Better Jobs, Better Care Demonstration projects.  The goal of this project is to provide policymakers with an understanding of the perspectives and experiences of frontline supervisors in long-term care organizations that are initiating workforce development interventions.  A major requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses expertise and experience in survey design, implementation, and analyses of data from direct care workers and supervisors participating in the Better Jobs, Better Care Demonstration grants.  The staff at Penn State have designed the evaluation of the Better Jobs, Better Care demonstration, and developed existing survey instruments for direct care workers participating in the demonstration.  The staff has also established close working relationships with the participating grantees under the Better Jobs/Better Care Demonstration project.  Pennsylvania State Universityís combination of research excellence and expertise in evaluation design, fielding and analysis of direct care workers and supervisory staff make it uniquely qualified to design and conduct a survey of frontline supervisors.  Pennsylvania State University alone has the unique qualifications and expertise that would allow the project to be completed in a timely fashion and with information relevant to government policymaking.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any other contractor but Pennsylvania State University would result an increase in cost.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by August 6, 2004.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Contractors may forward capability statements to the referenced address within 45 days after the date of publication of this Notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For further information, contact Paula Conner in Room 5C-13, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-2475.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), through the Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), Center for Health Care Policy and Research (CHCPR), 107 E. 70th Street, New York, NY 10021, a sole source contract to evaluate the Home Health Aide (HHA) Partnering Collaborative, which the VNSNY is implementing in conjunction with its subsidiary Partners in Care.  The aim of the HHA Collaborative is to achieve a ìhealthy work organizationî ñ one that will employ established principles of quality improvement to integrate professional and paraprofessional services, establish effective cross-disciplinary learning and yield positive changes in employee, organizational, and patient outcomes.  The goal of this project is to: 1) assess the worker, patient and organizational impacts of the HHA Collaborative, and 2) understand the implementation issues and strategies associated with integrating aides into care delivery teams.  A major requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses expertise, implementation and outcome data, and extensive research experience in analyses of home health workforce development practices.  The Center for Health Care Policy and Research  (CHCPR) is the only known scientifically oriented, externally funded research center that exists in any home care agency in the U.S.  CHCPR has a national reputation for conducting objective, high quality research on key issues relevant to improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of home health care. CHCPRís combination of research excellence and expertise in home care issues makes it uniquely qualified to evaluate the impact of the VNSNY Home Health Aide Collaborative on the aide workforce and on the quality of care provided to home health patients.  Additionally, CHCPR is also the only known scientific center to have conducted similar research, utilizing OASIS data to analyze its impact on patient outcomes; and the only known entity to collect quantitative and qualitative data that can be used to evaluate the impact of this learning collaborative on functional improvement of patients, worker satisfaction and retention.  Therefore, it is the Governments belief that to award this program to any contractor other then CHCPR would result in a significant increase in cost.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by August 6, 2004.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Contractors may forward capability statements to the referenced address within 45 days after the date of publication of this Notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For further information, contact Paula Conner in Room 5C-13, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-2475.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
ìExpanded Affiliated Groupî means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
52-412-04-03 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
ìForeign Incorporated Entityî means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
ìInverted Domestic Corporation.î A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)ó 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is heldó 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
ìPersonî, ìdomesticî, and ìforeignî have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
52-512-04-03 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

This is a combined synopsis/ solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13 and the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number / RFQ N00244-04-T-0709 applies; an electronic copy of the RFQ can be accessed at http://www.neco.navy.mil .

CLIN 0001 ñ  1.0  BACKGROUND    The Naval Facilities Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC), Port Hueneme receives numerous and repetitive requests for information and reports from a variety of organizations.  Fulfilling these requests by gathering data from multiple sources, putting it in a variety of formats, analyzing it on a recurring basis, and communicating it to multiple customers diverts significant management resources from critical decision-making tasks.  TOAARS was conceived, and fielded to conduct these functions more efficiently.  TOAARSí initial success has facilitated measuring the effectiveness of various aspects of the Naval Construction Forceís (NCF) Logistics Improvement Roadmap (LI R).  Quarterly data management reports are required to identify readiness and outfitting status for INCD and NAVFAC ENGCOM. 2.0  SCOPE    This statement of work (sow) covers TOAARS data management, analysis, and reporting efforts. 3.0  OBJECTIVE    This requirement provides for accurate, timely readiness and outfitting status reports.

Customer training and demonstrations may take place in Port Hueneme,CA. 4.7  The Contractor shall develop detailed specifications and an overall implementation strategy for assessing and implementing the Budget Module and supporting applications for the TOAARS systems for Mobile and Amphibious Naval Construction Forcesí (NCF) Table of Allowance equipments and material items as well as other Expeditionary Units supported by the NFELC. 4.8  The Contractor shall develop detailed plans for support of identified systems, addressing and including all remaining facets of Budget, Acquisition, and Sorts support to the 1NCD task.  A descrip tion of the detailed activities necessary to carry out the developed strategies shall be devised and tailored to identify planned support of specific modules or applications (e.g., Budgeting, Acquisition, SORTS feeder system, and so forth).  All reports will be required on the 12th of the month. Naval Facilities Information Technology Center (NITC) will update programs and load/refresh data on the TOAARS servers by accessing the Contractorís FTP server for transferring programs/data to NITC.

GFD will consist of Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint files, MS Access and/or hard copy documents.  These files/documents may contain program sensitive information and should not be reproduced in any form other than as required to accomplish this task.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with the University of Wisconsin, Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) for the development of Geostationary Interferometer Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) instrument processing software.  This development work will include the development of calibration algorithms applicable to GIFTS data cube processing and the archiving of related level 0 (pre-processing) and level 1 (post-processing) data.  The period of performance will be a base year of twelve months with four (4) twelve-month option periods.  The anticipated award date is September 15, 2004.  The National Air and Space Administration (NASA) has previously contracted with the SSEC to develop science algorithms for the calibration of the GIFTS instrument.  This follow-on NOAA work will require the SSEC to develop prototype software to realize these algorithms so that their accuracy and performance can be evaluated in a near-operational environment.  The resulting code will be used in verifying calibration of the (proposed) GIFTS instrument engineering model.  It is anticipated that the processing and archiving of the GIFTS ground processing system will closely mirror that required by future Hyperspectral instruments, necessitating the development of a prototype ground system where these processing needs can be verified.  All responsible sources may submit a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirement.  Interested parties submitting capability statements should address their experience and capability to develop calibration algorithms applicable to GIFTS data cube processing and archiving.  The following web-sites may be of interest: http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/eo3/index.html; http://arm1.ssec.wisc.edu/~paoloa/documents/thesis/node4.html. 
The capability statement/technical information must be submitted within 45 days of this notice, to the above address.  To be considered an affirmative response, offerors must provide sufficient information to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  It is required that pricing data be included as part of an affirmative response.  Responses without documentation will be considered non-responsive.  Telephonic and facsimile responses shall not be accepted.  Please reference the solicitation number stated above in your response.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Dr. Catherine Royer, UMR 5048 CNRS UN MONTPELLIER I, INSERM U554 29 RUE DE NAVACELL, Montpellier, France 34090, to provide services for the Development of 2-Phonton Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy/Microscopy.  The period of performance is approximately nine (9) months.  Dr. Royer, is an expert in the field of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), particularly cross-correlation acquisition and global analysis. Her knowledge will help to accomplish the co-development (with the microscopy core) of new 2-photon fluorescence microscopy capabilities.    The work requires considerable experience in the biophysical study of protein-protein and/or protein-DNA complexes with 2-photon FCS methods, along with experience in the application of high hydrostatic pressure to fluorescence measurements on similar systems.  The sole source determination is based upon Dr. Royerís, experiences in biomedical fluorescence  spectroscopy, and  experience in high pressure spectroscopy.  Her experience will expedite the collaboration between Laboratory of Biophysical Chemistry (LBC),  and the microscopy core to develop this capability.  In order for NHLBI to obtain the best possible outcome in the development of 2-Photon Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy/Microscopy, it is critical that Dr. Royer, is issued the award based on her knowledge and expertise.  An award to any other source would effect the anticipated outcome of the research and threaten the investment already made, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541690, and Size Standard is $6.0M.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract  is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>17.  This is a combined synopsis/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included 
in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being re-quested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is being issued as a Notice of Intent under NOI4074.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-24.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business set-aside.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 112930 and the Small Business Size Standard $0.75.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure Two (2) Male fpr-rs2 kockout mice and Two (2) Female fpr-rs2 knockout mice.   These Knockout mice will be procured  from Deltagen, Inc.   These mice are required to study the role of the receptor gene fpr-rs2 (FPR-L1) in inflammation and Alzheimerís Disease.  This is a continuous study  of chemotactic and chemokine receptors and the role they  play in human disease.  During our studies we discovered that a particular receptor (FPR-L1 in humans and fpr-rs2 in mice) were receptors for amyloid-B.  This discovery has suggested that the receptor is involved in Alzheimerís Disease.  The NIH has been working to develop a fpr-rs2 gene deleted mouse to ascertain the role this receptor plays in the disease process.  Deltagen, Inc. of San Carlos, California has developed a mouse with its fpr-rs2 gene deleted. Deltagen, Inc. is the only company that has developed the fpr-rs2 knockout mouse.  The fpr-rs2 knockout mouse will be used in studies of  1) proinflammatory responses and the expression of cytokines and chemokines; 2) the role of fpr-rs2 in affecting susceptibility to infectious diseases; and 3) the role of fpr-rs2 in the pathogenesis of disease including Alzheimerís disease.  If the knockout mice are dead upon delivery or die within thirty (30) days of delivery through no fault of NIAID, Deltagen will replace any dead mice, if replacement mice are available.  If replacement mice are not available,  NIAID shall have no obligation to pay the fee.  The vendor  must have a PHS Approved Animal Welfare Assurance.  Delivery is three months after receipt of the purchase order.  These mice must be quarantine 8-10 weeks at the Rockville Facility.  The FOB Point shall be Destination, Rockville, Maryland, 20852.

JWIS supports, among other locations, the CAOC-N and JEFX 04 scheduled to culminate its activities between 19 July - 6 August 2004. The weather system provides an interface between Air Force weather and C4I users/applications. It provides tailored web pages for C2 users, 4D data cube, Joint Metoc Broker Language (JMBL), and access to gridded data. At JEFX, JWIS will interface with the Naval Integrated Tactical Environmental Subsystems (NITES) II and the Master Air Attack Planning Toolkit (MAAP TK). <br><br> If a firm believes that it is capable of meeting the Government's requirements, it may identify interest and capability to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of this publication. Interested firms must indicate whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8a, or women-owned businesses and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned. Any firms interested in subcontract opportunities should contact Raytheon directly. If no affirmative written responses are received by close of business, 22 June 2004, then a sole source contract will be pursued with Raytheon Corporation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. CBD numbered notes are: 22.

The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) has directed the United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) to explore options and formulate recommendations for establishing an environment that is more conducive to efficient Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS).    MNIS is not in and of itself an end user product.  It is the concept of establishing an environment that facilitates the seamless flow of information between coalition partners within a common operational environment while reducing or eliminating obstacles that inhibit information flow.   Efficient, seamless ways to share information of varying classification levels and political sensitivities over a single network do not currently exist.  All Combatant Commanders have identified this as a significant operational issue in planning, coordination and execution of multinational operations.    Current solutions to this challenge include constructing new networks based on Communities of Interest (COI) or by sending information (at a mutually agreed to security level) one-way through a common network.   These solutions are problematic in that, every recent combat operation has relied on different coalition partnerships requiring new networks that are becoming too cost and labor intensive to maintain along with providing another choke point for information flow to be inhibited.   USJFCOM is seeking concepts that will provide the following baseline functional capabilities.  1.   CAPABILITY TO MARK (HUMAN READABLE) AND LABEL (MACHINE ACTIONABLE) INFORMATION OBJECTS.   This includes the capability to bind the label to the information object and the capability to establish and maintain information object integrity to include assurance that changes/modifications to information objects (primarily MS Office products) cannot be attributed (source protection) and recovered (sanitization) once the document is saved and released.  2.  CAPABILITY OF ASSURED IDENTIFICATION, AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION MECHANISM USING AT LEAST TWO FACTORS OF IDENTIFICATION.  This includes the capability to provide an assured path between the identification hardware (e.g., token and biometrics readers) and the workstation Operating System (OS) to ensure that attackers cannot intercept or modify the identification and authentication process and the capability to correlate user authorizations to the labels used to maintain information separation and access control.  3.  CAPABILITY OF MAINTAINING ASSURED DATA SEPARATION (INFORMATION DOMAINS) WITHIN THE WORKSTATION, AND ALLOWS ACCESS TO INFORMATION OBJECTS BASED ON A MATCH BETWEEN USER AUTHORIZATIONS AND INFORMATION OBJECT LABELS.  This includes the capability to detect and prevent the introduction of malicious code and the capability to protect assurance mechanisms from malicious code and unauthorized attacks. 4. COLLABORATE TOOL SET CAPABILITY WITHIN THE CROSS-DOMAIN ENVIRONMENT WITH CAPABILITY FOR MANY TO MANY AND FEW TO MANY SESSIONS.  This includes the capability for group chat with private chat with private chat option, the capability for document sharing and asynchronous capability, i.e. bulletin board, whiteboard, discussion threads.   The proposed concept must consider certification to process US classified information in accordance with published National Security Agency (NSA) security guidelines for certification of cryptographic devices.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS.  The following process is established for the submission of INITIAL proposals under this BAA.   The initial proposal shall contain a project description addressing the characteristics/capabilities identified herein (i.e., sufficient detail to identify its relationship to and value to the MNIS concept described in this BAA) and any requirement for access to government facilities, systems, documentation or information as well as a point of contact to provide information and answer further questions, if necessary.  Contractor format is acceptable.  Initial proposal submissions shall be unclassified.   Initial proposals may be submitted in response to this announcement through 31 July 2004.  The initial proposal submission should be submitted to Ms. Regina Magee (regina.magee@navy.mil), FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083.   If there is sufficient interest in a material solution proposed, the Contracting Officer may request the submission of an EXPANDED research proposal.   Any expanded research proposal which may be requested will be evaluated on its scientific and technical merit and the overall potential contribution to MNIS effort.  The primary basis for selecting an expanded research proposal for award shall be scientific/technical merit, importance to the MNIS efforts, and cost realism/reasonableness.   While scientific and technical merit and overall contribution to the program will generally outweigh estimated costs, the decision to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability.   Contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research and development (R&D) may be issued in those areas covered above.    This BAA is not intended to be extended beyond award(s) on proposals submitted as a result of this announcement.    The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the initial proposals received.

<DESC>Under Request for Quotation, TIRNO-04-Q-00096, the IRS has a requirement to provide CULTURAL AWARENESS and SENSITIVITY TRAINING to its employees.  To accomplish this goal, the IRS seeks to make a 1-time purchase of an existing, commercially-available ëoff-the-shelfí training package on how to recognize, appreciate, be aware and sensitive to the cultural differences of the taxpayer community.  The ultimate goal is for the IRS to be able to train approximately 90,000 IRS employees nation-wide, who have varying levels of interface with taxpayers.  The IRS wants the rights to the training materials in order to be able to modify the training materials to suit the needs of its employees on a geographical and/or cultural basis.  The existing training should be designed for traditional classroom delivery (paper-based) as well as e-learning/on-line delivery.  The training materials should also have an instructorís manual.  This commercial training package should also provide a ëtrain-the-trainerí component.  It is anticipated that there will be a ëpilotí period where the IRS will modify the training materials to meet its specific needs; the Contractor will provide assistance to the IRS during the ëpilotí phase.  At the conclusion of the ëpilotí phase, the final version will accepted and the ëtrain-the-trainerí classes will be completed.  It is anticipated that the ëpilotí phase will not exceed 6 months.  The entire proposed period of performance will not exceed 12 months.  Vendors will be evaluated on past performance/experience; key personnel; compliance with 508 requirements and price.   This will be a 100% small business set-aside requirement (Numbered Note 1 applicable).  Interested parties will be able to access the RFQ from the IRS Procurement website at http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov/ within 10 business days from the posting of this notice.  Questions concerning this requirement shall be sent via e-mail to the contracting officer @ Helen.D.Carmona@irs.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The GLM shall be capable of firing all current U.S. standard 40mm x 46mm low-velocity ammunition. It must have a breach mechanism that is able to accept improved lethality munitions with longer payloads/warheads than current 40X46mm munitions to accommodate system growth. The GLM must initially mount on the M4 Modular Weapon System with a mounting architecture flexible enough for adaption to the M16A2 and M16A4 rifle as well as future rifles/carbines (mounting hardware can differ for attachment to each host weapon; however, the basic launcher and sighting system must be able to mount to all host weapon variations and without modifications). When removed and replaced, the module will return to its normal bore allignment regardless of the host weapon interface. The GLM must have a probability of hit (within a 5 meter radius) of: P(H)_>.60 at100m,>.50 at 200m_> .30 at 300m_> .20 at 400m. The GLM shall include a sight that provides day and night targeting and a secondary sight in the event the primary sight becomes inoperable separ- ated from the weapon. The GLM system must have a rage determination capability. Each GLM shall possess a stand-alone capability in addition to its role as a combination weapon. The GLM requirement will be met with a base contract of 60 systems for developmental testing to be procured in FY04. There will be up to 2000 systems and a second option of up to 9000 systems. The contractor must be able to sustain a delivery schedule of 240 systems per month with a possible increase of as much as 1,000 systems per month beginning sixty (60) days from successful completion of First Article Testing. The offeror shall submit five  (5) bid samples , in addition to written technical proposals, each with a  sighting system, a reange determination device, an M4 MWS mounting configura- tion and a stand-alone kit.

There shall also be a First Article Test (FAT) quantity of five (5) items that must be passed prior to approval of the first option. The Government reserves the right to waive FAT.  Proposals shall identify to the Government if the product being offered is a commercially available or a non-developmental item. Proprietary and/or classified information will be protected if requested with submission. A  competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the TACOM-ARDEC Acquisition Center website located at: http://procnet.pica.army.mil on or about July 16, 2004.

This Modification also restates the NAICS Code 54611 and the Size Standard: $6.0 Million for clarification purposes.  All other terms and condition remain unchanged as follows:


The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NECís outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT ñ The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT ñ The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contrmaterials.  MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating countryís export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Governmentís export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating countryís specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  HOWEVER, IT WILL CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF A CASCADING SET-ASIDE PREFERENCE WHICH PUT LARGE BUSINESSES ON NOTICE THAT, IF THE AGENCY RECEIVES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESS OFFERS, LARGE BUSINESS PROPOSALS RECEIVED SIMPLY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.

In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of traiCONTROL EXCHANGES - Many times a year, the NEC group works with cooperating Governments and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) to sponsor export control conferences on a variety of topics. These conferences can be specific to the host country or can be regional in nature. In order to effectively manage these conferences, the Contractor shall established business relationships with the conference hosts who have in turn handled the local logistics including venue, speakers, program material, simultaneous interpretation, and other miscellaneous support activities. As a co-sponsor of these conferences, the NEC group will often ensure a US presence at the conferences. The Contractor shall work with the NEC group to identify and prepare U.S. Industry participants who will be part of the US delegation to the conference. MANAGEMENT OF EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM DEPLOYMENTS -As a result of efforts since 1994, the NEC group has made significant progress with cooperating Governments in building export control institutions. In particular, as the cooperating countryís export control systems are developed, the need to have good industry and Government cooperation has become apparent. In the field of industry-Government relations, the contractor developed software tool, the Internal Control Program (ICP), shall be modified and adapted to the regulatory environment of specific cooperating countries. The ICP tool establishes a framework for the foreign industry to comply with its own Governmentís export control regulations and meet international standards regarding control of strategic commodities. The Contractor shall work with the export control agency or its designated NGO to establish a plan to modify and deploy these country specific versions of the ICP tool. Efforts shall be made to encourage all countries to adopt all 10 elements of the generic ICP model, but the ultimate product shall be a function of the cooperating countryís specific export control law and regulations. A rapid series of ICP deployments have taken place in Russia, Ukraine, and a select set of Central European countries. Based on the number and geographical diversity of the foreign enterprises, the Contractor shall be required to handle some deployments independently of the NEC group. LOGISTICS SUPPORT  - In the course of conducting the international training program, both in the US and abroad, the contractor shall  plan and manage logistics for both US and foreign nationals for ticketing, billeting, conference facility management, and ground transportation.  OTHER ACTIVITIES - Based on the number of countries and the expanding scope of activities under the NEC outreach programs, the NEC group may require the Contractor to perform other unique tasks as they arise. These requirements may be generated by outside agencies such as State and Defense Departments who are trying to coordinate their activities with the NEC group. NEC envisions a greater contractor role in the continuous planning for fiscal year budget submissions based on medium to long-range strategic goals and in planning, scheduling and implementing short-term (one year) operation plans. NAICS Code: 541611. Size Standard: $6.0. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  HOWEVER, IT WILL CONTAIN THE PROVISIONS OF A CASCADING SET-ASIDE PREFERENCE WHICH PUT LARGE BUSINESSES ON NOTICE THAT, IF THE AGENCY RECEIVES A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESS OFFERS, LARGE BUSINESS PROPOSALS RECEIVED SIMPLY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION TO DG1351-04-RP-0023 IS ISSUED TO REVISE THE SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE AND THE PROPOSALS DUE DATE.  THE RELEASE DATE FOR THE SOLICITATION IS REVISED FROM APRIL 16, 2004 TO MAY 7, 2004.  THE PROPOSALS DUE DATE IS REVISED FROM MAY 17, 2004 TO JUNE 7, 2004.


The U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement  to provide support to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)/Non-Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) Cooperative Program.  BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION  - The United States assists the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic countries, Central Europe Countries, and other countries to assume the full responsibility for preventing the proliferation of equipment and technologies that could be used in the development or delivery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with other U.S. Government agencies, works with these countries in establishing fair and effective national export control systems. The BIS/Non Proliferation and Export Control (NEC) group has been working in cooperative outreach programs with export control organizations in these countries since 1994. The level and scope of NECís outreach efforts have increased due to the growing concerns of the U.S. Government regarding the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems. For example, in FY 2003, NEC conducted more than double the number of technical exchange activities from the previous year (approximately 75 - 95). This has required NEC to restructure its contract mechanisms and redefine the roles and relationships between federal staff and contract support staff. Historically, the NEC group requires contractor support in the areas of: TRAINING DEVELOPMENT ñ The contractor shall work under the direction of the NEC group to identify training modules for development in order to meet the requirements of particular cooperating countries. These modules augmented the existing NEC training material originally established as part of the NEC Course Curriculum. These training materials satisfy learning objectives that are established by NEC in a model country plan. The appropriate mix of instructional methods and delivery approaches (e.g. lecture, role-play, simulations group discussions) was evaluated and integrated into the training material to meet the learning objectives. The Contractor shall maintain a technical library of Government-owned course material, program books, and other materials which is Government property. The library shall allow access to previously developed training material, agendas, and presentations (electronic and hard copy form) for use in planning future programs.  TRAINING DELIVERY AND DEPLOYMENT ñ The Contractor shall deliver training courses to export control officials and experts in cooperating countries in the various export control areas (e.g. legal, regulatory, licensing, control lists, industry/Government relations, export enforcement). These courses are to be delivered in the US in a government owned facility to foreign delegations from participating countries. The contractor is also to deliver training workshops, seminars and conferences in foreign locations. For both the foreign and domestic training delivery activity, the Contractor shall be responsible for organizing the material, arranging for translation, and coordinating speakers from within the Department of Commerce, other U.S. Government agencies and U.S. industry. Program books shall be built and reproduced for the technical exchanges/seminars and copies of course materials shall be provided to the foreign trainees. In order to ensure the most widespread use of the training material and software training tools within the client country, the contractor shall, at times, provide specific hardware such as computers, zip drives or other computer peripherals.  NEC is interested in exploring creative strategies for the delivery of training ning materials.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR 
IRS KANSAS CITY CAMPUS CONSOLIDATION 
Solicitation Number:  GS06P04GZC0006
Main Post Office, 315 W. Pershing Road, Kansas City, Missouri

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about July 14, 2004.

This solicitation is set aside for exclusive small business participation, in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.  The NAICS code is 236620, and the small business size standard is $28,500,000.  Offers received from business concerns that do not qualify as a small business concern shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected.  

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a Construction Management (CM) contractor for GSAs IRS Kansas City Campus Consolidation at the Main Post Office, 315 W. Pershing Road, Kansas City, Missouri.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, specifications, the solicitation provisions, the proposal submittal requirements and the evaluation factors.  The RFP will be issued on or about June 23, 2004.  Estimated cost range is $1,000,000 -- $4,000,000 for the base year and up to three option years.  The options will be exercised if the Government chooses, and if the CM contractors performance is satisfactory.  Award is expected to be made in August 2004 for the base year.  This contract is limited to only those firms having an existing CM services contracting office in the state of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri or Nebraska and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice. Additional preference will be given to those firms having an existing CM services contracting office in the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice.  The SMSA includes the Kansas counties of Franklin, Johnson, Leavenworth, Linn, Miami, and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Bates, Caldwell, Cass, Clay, Clinton, Jackson, Lafayette, Platte, and Ray. Contractors working with or for the Developer/Lessor or its subcontractors will not be allowed to compete in this solicitation.

The existing Main Post Office has been acquired by DST Realty as Developer/Lessor.  The building will be completely renovated.  The Government, as Lessee, is contracting for a 1,140,000 rentable square foot lease. The remaining square feet and parking will be build-to-suit.  GSA will manage the Lessor/Developers performance of the lease requirements.  The selected CM will be responsible for the following activities, which are not limited to:  design; procurement; construction; and post-construction phase services.  Design phase services include design reviews of the drawings and specifications; verification that the completed design complies with GSA standards, applicable codes, and is within the scope of work identified for the project.  Construction phase services include inspection of work performed by the general contractor for conformity with contract requirements; monitoring review and approval of submittals required by the contract documents; monitoring the budget for the entire project to maintain an accurate cost picture of the project; providing reports comparing budgeted costs with current cost estimates; and reviewing Lessors cost estimates to ensure the project can be completed with available funds.  This phase also includes review and monitoring of the schedule; chairing meetings and maintaining meeting minutes; preparing reports; notifying GSA of problems and issues that arise; and providing independent cost estimates for lease contract modifications.  Post-construction phase services include deficiencies and omissions inspections, maintaining as-built drawings; and support for other post-construction phase activities. 

GSA anticipates the award of a negotiated firm fixed price contract using source selection procedures to obtain the greatest value for the Government.  The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the contractor.  The trade-off process is a method of evaluating technical qualification factors specified in the solicitation, and then price, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications are more important than price.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage one will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage two will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  Technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in order of importance:  1)  Past Performance of the firm; 2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and 3) Management Plan.   Proposals will first be evaluated for technical qualifications.  After all proposals have been evaluated for technical qualifications, price proposals will be opened and separately evaluated.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors.  However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposals acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals and establish a competitive range if necessary.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval.   
In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications) and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Companys Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Companys CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Companys DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Companys Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to Register with FedTeds and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official plan holders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

Proposals are due at GSA on July 23, 2004, at 10:00 AM Central Time.

The RFP specification will be available by link via the Solicitation.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the proposal documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Doug Benton, at 816-823-4601, or fax at (816) 823-5906.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions. The due date is not extended. Q: Does the surveyor/industrial hygienist have to have a license in Colorado? A: The federal government does not require the surveyor/industrial hygienist to be locally licensed, however the surveyor/industrial hygienist should have knowledge of local codes and laws.  Q: Where can I find FAR part 52 Clause Subcontractors and Outside Associates and Consultants(Architect-Engineer Services)? The outside associates also wanted to know what they should mark themselves as on section C of the SF 330. A: As there is no place to mark themselves as outside associates in section C the firm should mark themselves as a sub-contractor.  The FAR and DFARS clauses can be found on the farsite website; at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. The text of clause asked for is below; 52.244-4 -Subcontractors and Outside Associates and Consultants (Architect-Engineer Services)(Aug 1998) Any subcontractors and outside associates or consultants required by the Contractor in connection with the services covered by the contract wi ll be limited to individuals or firms that were specifically identified and agreed to during negotiations. The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written consent before making any substitution for these subcontractors, associates, or consult ants.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  The Coast Guard is seeking qualified sources that can provide four (4) each hose assemblies ìHelicopter In Flight Refueling Rigî (HIFR).  NSN 4720-01-372-6533 manufactured by Eaton Aeroquip, Inc.  This will be a stand-alone one-time buy contract.  The Eaton Aeroquip hose assemblies make possible the delivery of aviation fuel from a Coast Guard Cutter to a helicopter during underway missions while the helicopter hovers just above the cutter.  This capability is critical to enable the extended Coast Guard missions when conditions make it unsafe to land the helicopter on the cutter.  The assemblies shall be delivered to:  United States Coast Guard, Engineering Logistics Center, Warehouse Bldg 88, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD  21226-5000.  This will be other than full and open competition using OEM Eaton Aeroquip, Inc. for the assemblies only. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Eaton Aeroquip, Inc. parts are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEM.  Accordingly, it is believe that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center from obtaining competition, as they are available from one source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer or its actual supplier.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts.  The submission of technical data packages for review shall not impede the award.  It is the Governmentís belief that only Eaton Aeroquip, Inc., the manufacturer of the hose assemblies (HIFR) and/or its authorized dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  The US Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the parts of an alternate product.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Rachelle J. Stanley, Contract Specialist (CODE 045).    See number notes 22, and 26*****

<DESC>This is a request for information (Sources Sought Synopsis). This is not a solicitation. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of providing the Agency with a revised and updated version of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT) and its companion publication, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles (SCO), published by the Department of Labor (DOL). SSA relies on these publications for its disability evaluation process and work opportunity and employment support initiatives.  In its regulations, SSA takes administrative notice of reliable job information available from various governmental and other publications [20 CFR 404.1566(d) and 416.966(d)]. SSA currently uses the DOT and the SCO as the primary sources of information about jobs, job requirements, and the existence of work in the national economy.  In addition, SSA's regulatory guidelines are based on DOT constructs and definitions. For example, they define sedentary, light and medium strength work in the same way it is defined in the DOT/SCO. However, DOL has not formally updated the DOT/SCO since 1991 and has no plans to do so. Instead, DOL is developing an entirely new system, the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. This system is useful for career and educational exploration and planning, but it does not provide the type of data required for disability claim adjudication or vocational rehabilitation and job placement of persons with disabilities. Therefore, SSA is seeking an existing occupational database that has been updated to provide the same type of data shown in the DOT/SCO, which SSA can use while developing alternative sources of occupational data. The database must:  1) currently exist (SSA is not interested in developing such a database for interim use); 2) utilize the same constructs and definitions as the DOT/SCO; 3) contain the complete set of descriptors found in the DOT/SCO; 4) contain information on work found in the national economy that is more recent than the 1991 version of the DOT/SCO; 5) be representative of work found in the national economy; and 6) have been developed in a statistically valid, reliable and defensible manner. If you feel your organization has the corporate capability and expertise for performing this type of service, provide the following information via E-MAIL ONLY about your company: 1) company or university name, address, e-mail address, website address, point of contact, and telephone number, 2) corporate capability statement (not to exceed 2 pages) that includes similar experience and references, 3) name of the database, and 4) the source of data. This request for information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information is based on this request or information is purely voluntary. SSA may make a solicitation available at FEDBIZOPPS at a later date. If a solicitation is posted, it will be preceded by a presolicitation announcement that will specify an anticipated solicitation issue date sometime in 2003. Any questions should be submitted via E-MAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer at London.Johnson@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify any businesses that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide Multi-Level, Multi Matrix Organic Sample Analyses for USEPA's Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI).  The information from this announcement will be used to determine the percentage extent to which this acquisition will be set aside for small business concerns. This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply USEPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for the isolation, detection, quantitative measurement, and reporting of trace volatile, low/medium volatile, semivolatile, pesticide, and Aroclor target compounds in water and soil/sediment environmental samples.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380. The USEPA intends to award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with a one-year base period and four 12-month option periods to meet the USEPA's sample analyses need of approximately 48,000 samples per year. Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated exhibits/appendices, which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/som1.htm).

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-IE-01
<RESPDATE>071204
<CONTACT>Bridget Hamel, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9521, Fax 410-966-9310, Email bridget.hamel@ssa.gov
<DESC>This IS a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Industry Comments.  This IS NOT a SOLICITATION.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) anticipates awarding a 3-year, single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) to a FSS vendor capable of providing the services of an Independent Evaluator (IE).  IE services will include pre-award and post-award evaluations of occupational information and methodology employed by private-sector entities to produce an occupational information product that revises and updates the Dictionary of Occupational Titles Revised 4th Edition (DOT), published by the Department of Labor (DOL).  Preaward IE evaluation services will consist of evaluations of subscription offerorís technical proposals, affiliated documentation and occupational information products submitted in response to SSAís Request for Proposals (RFP).  Postaward IE services will consist of an extensive evaluation of SSAís selected subscription contractorís occupational information and evaluation of information updates as required.  SSAís requirements are further delineated in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).

FYI - Under a separate RFI (see attachment A), SSA is concurrently seeking, from an unrelated private-sector entity, access to a subscription for an electronic publication that will provide SSA with updated and revised DOT-based occupational information for use as a replacement for the DOT in SSAís disability evaluation process. Before SSA can use this private-sector information, SSA must know if the data is statistically valid, reliable, accurate, verifiable, reproducible, and defensible for use in its disability evaluation process. 

If you feel your organization has the corporate capability and expertise for performing the above type of service AND the service is available on GSA FSS, please provide the following information about your company VIA EMAIL ONLY to Bridget Hamel at bridget.hamel@ssa.gov:
1. Company name, address, email address, website address, and point of contact 
2. GSA FSS contract number 
3. Does your company have experience evaluating technical proposals for Government entities?  If yes, briefly explain.  
4. Does your company have experience evaluating occupational or similar information?  If yes, briefly explain.
5. Does your company have experience evaluating private-sector information, similar to that described in the SoW, for statistic validity and accuracy?  If yes, briefly explain.

Although SSA would prefer demonstrated experience specifically evaluating occupational information, SSA recognizes that offerors may not have this specific experience.     Therefore, SSA will consider similar experience evaluating technical proposals for Government entities and similar experience evaluating private-sector information for statistic validity and accuracy.  

In addition, SSA is seeking industry comments on the viability and comprehensiveness of its PWS as well as recommendations.  Comments on the following are appreciated:
1. Are there any concerns or areas of uncertainty, which in your opinion, require clarification or correction?
2. Are SSA's requirements clear and explicable?  Do you have any suggestions for improving the PWS?
3. Through a separate RFI (attachment A) as described in paragraph 2 above, SSA attached its DRAFT Instructions to Offerors and Evaluation Criteria.  The anticipated BPA described within this RFI will require the IE to evaluate subscription offerorís technical proposals, affiliated documentation (to further support offerorís contention that its informational product is viable) and its occupation information products.    Does your company have any recommendations for the types of written documentation to be submitted by the subscription offeror that will best assist SSA and the IE in its technical evaluations?    
4. Do you have any concerns or questions regarding the subscription offerorís RFI?
 
SSA anticipates issuing a Request for Quotation for the services described within approximately August 2004 and awarding a single BPA within 60 days thereafter.  
 
This RFI is not a solicitation and does not constitute a request for quotation or proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is strictly for determining capable sources for market research purposes only and for incorporating industry comments into the PWS.  Submission of any information based on this RFI is purely voluntary.  
 
Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer, Bridget Hamel, at bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.

Example:  On July 10th  the judge requires parties to file a motion with the court in 45 days. The reference calendar will have July 10th on a separate page and will provide a table of future dates below in increments of 5 working days, weeks (1,2,3 or 4), months   (1,2,3,4,5,6, or 9), and days ( 10,13,15,20,30,40,45,60,90,123, or 180). The judge will open the calendar to July 10th and find the filing date by looking at the 45 day increment and set 8-26-04 as the filing date. Holidays would not be included. Do not send standard wall calendars. Please submit information and samples of the types of calenders your company provides.  Additionally, please provide details about your company (size, location, etc. ) and pricing.  Information can be mailed to Janet R.

<SUBJECT>A -- ICBM Command and Control Applications
<DESC>The following information is provided as part of a market survey of industry to determine if any potential contractors have the skill, knowledge, abilities, and equipment required to complete this effort.

The existing ICBM Command & Control infrastructure is not expected to meet the needs of a future system due to sustainment issues and an anticipated increase in data throughput requirements.  The ICBM System Program Office (SPO) is planning a Research & Development task with whose objective is to assess mature technologies that can be integrated with the existing ICBM C2 infrastructure to improve availability, sustainability, and capacity.   It is expected that this effort will produce detailed test and instrumentation plans to evaluate mature technologies, for example, to test full copper capability of smart HICS multiplexing, 4-wire modems, or something similar, possibly using the Peacekeeper site at the Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) at Hill AFB, to prove viability of this alternative and the actual data rates that may be achievable in a networked environment.  This effort also requires a final report outlining the acquisition and sustainment costs of each alternate technology solution with reliability projections in reference to support, enhanced capability and integration with the existing MM III HICS system.

Potential sources are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities/White Paper by 2:00 p.m. Mountain Standard time by 7 July 2004 to the following address':     Advanced Strategic Missile Division ICBM System Program Office (OO-ALC/LMX), Attn. Major Parrish (Phone 801-586-5367,  Fax 801-586-0700, email jerry.parish@hill.af.mil), 6023 Elm Lane/Bldg 1248, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5819 and OO-ALC/LMKA, Attn: Jill Berriochoa, 6014 Dogwood Ave/Bldg 1258/Rm 25, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5816.

Submissions should be limited to 10 pages and should be specific in outlining source's capabilities to assess mature technologies that can be integrated with the existing ICBM C2 infrastructure to improve availability, sustainability, and capacity.

Note: This is a sources sought synopsis only, not a request for proposals (RFP), and this is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. No proprietary data should be submitted in response to the synopsis. Any submissions will be considered to be public information and may be handled by non-government personnel.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) testing of Udimet 720 alloys. Background: NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is continuing its work to develop probabilistic lifting models for nickel based disk alloys. This SOW summarizes the requirements for continuation of ongoing low cycle fatigue (LCF) testing of Udimet 720 alloy at elevated temperatures.  The large PGR-3 button head specimen geometry requires a 50 Kip servo-hydraulic frame to perform these tests.  Specifications: The LCF testing shall be conducted at 800∞F, and 1200∞F using PGR-3 specimen geometry shown in Figure 1 (see attachment). The Contractor shall perform strain-controlled or load-controlled fatigue tests according to the latest ASTM E-606 standards.  Stress-strain hysteresis loops at periodic cycles as well as tabulated results including initial and half life values of modulus, maximum and minimum stresses, and inelastic strain range shall be reported as appropriate; as well as expansion strain, initiation life, and failure life.  The testing shall consist of interrupted strain-controlled and load-controlled fatigue tests. Tests will be stopped approximately three to four times during the life of the specimen at NASA GRC specified cycle increments.  After each interruption the specimens shall be separately packaged, marked with specimen ID number and send for an overnight mail delivery shipment to NASA GRC. After the first interruption the tests shall be switched from strain control to load control and cycled for a designated number of fatigue cycles. The test frequency shall be 20 cycles per minute for the first 20,000 cycles followed by 10 Hertz if the lives exceed the 20,000 cycle criteria. In order to decrease the variability in test results all tests shall be conducted on a single well aligned servo-hydraulic test frame. In order to expedite the testing, the Contractor shall reinitiate the testing in the designated frame within three working days after the interrupted specimens are returned to the Contractor by NASA. The interrupted testing of specimens is expected to last two years. Udimet 720 LCF bars have a tendency to exhibit serrated yielding during the initial strain controlled cycles. This undesirable characteristic needs to be avoided. The Contractor shall propose a testing methodology to avoid serrated yielding phenomena. The test quotes shall be provided in test duration-dependent forms, so that the costs of 10, 24, 36, and 72 hour tests can be computed by NASA in each case. Initial set up fee for strain control as well as subsequent set up fee for load control testing segments shall be included in the quote.  Deliverables: After failure, each specimen shall be separately packaged according to specimen identification number and shipped to NASA Glenn Research Center, Attn: Jack Telesman, 21000 Brookpark Rd., Mail Stop 49-7, Cleveland, Ohio 44135 with all the accompanying test records. Period of Performance: The period of performance for this effort shall be 24 months after receipt of order. This shall be a fixed price order. The Government will evaluate price based on 24 hours of testing **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THEIR QUOTATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE STATEMENT OF WORK** The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-22.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Ceramic Matrix Composite Box Structure. Background: The NASA Glenn Research Centerís (GRC) Ultra Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) program requires a Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) manufacturer to fabricate components from silicon carbide reinforced silicon carbide (SiC/SiC) composite materials.  These SiC/SiC composite parts shall be reinforced with SiC fibers, shall have an external BN fiber coating, and shall have a CVI SiC matrix. Tasks: The Contractor shall fabricate SiC/SiC composite box structures for NASA Glenn Research Center.  The silicon carbide fibers required to reinforce these ducts shall be supplied by the Government and will be SylramicÆ SiC.  The box structure shall be fabricated in accordance with the geometric details shown in the Figures 1, 2 and 3 (see attachment).    NASA GRC shall provide an electronic engineering drawing (AutoCad or IGES) of the CMC box structure to the vendor.  The electronic engineering drawing can be used by the vendor for tool design. The completed SiC/SiC box structure shall be one continuous piece.  During operation, this part shall contain flowing air.  A structure consisting of separate parts, which are not bonded together and thus would have air gaps between them, is not acceptable. The Contractor shall also fabricate SiC/SiC plates.  These plates shall be machined in accordance with the profile as shown in Figure 4 (see attachment) and shall have a nominal thickness of 0.090î.  The silicon carbide fibers required to reinforce these plates shall be supplied by the Government and shall be SylramicÆ SiC.	NASA shall provide an electronic engineering drawing (AutoCad or IGES) of the SiC/SiC plate shapes to the vendor. The Contractor shall be responsible for the fabrication of the net-shaped mandrels used to form the mold line geometry of the box structure and plates.  The fiber architecture for the box structure and plates shall [0/90] 5 HS SylramicÆ SiC cloth with a target fiber content of 35-40 volume percent and a nominal thickness of 0.090 inches for the walls of the box structure and the plates.  The preforms shall be interface coated and consolidated via the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process.  The Contractor shall apply a BN interface coating onto the fibrous preform to a uniform nominal thickness of 0.15 to 0.17 thousandths of an inch.  Following the application of the necessary fiber coating, the preform will be consolidated with a silicon carbide matrix via the CVI process to a target 90% theoretical density level.  Following silicon carbide densification, the component shall be machined to the dimensions as specified in the drawings and a final seal coat application of CVI SiC will be applied to the component to close out all free edges exposed as a result of machining.  Requirements for Descriptive Literature: In order to ascertain that the Contractor can fabricate these SiC/SiC box structures, the prospective Contractor shall furnish the following information for technical evaluation: 1.	A brief description of the SiC fiber preforms required in order to make the SiC/SiC composite structure.  Of particular interest is the approach used to assemble the final, one-piece part.	Details regarding processes used to consolidate fiber cloth preforms are not required, only a description of preform shape(s) to be used to make the final part.  Sylramic fiber cloth with a 5 harness satin, [0/90] weave, shall be used to make the preforms. 2.	Data comparing design tolerances versus actual part tolerances in units of inches for SiC/SiC parts manufactured under previous government programs or contracts by the prospective contractor.  Dimensions of interest include wall thickness, radii of curvature, inner and outer diameters as they apply to SiC/SiC parts such as combustor liners and rocket nozzles. Failure to provide either of the above-specified items shall render the bid non-responsive. Deliverables: The Contractor shall supply three box structures as shown in Figures 1 through 3 and six plates as shown in Figure 4. Period of Performance: The period of performance for this effort shall be 6 months after receipt of order. **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THEIR QUOTATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE STATEMENT OF WORK** The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-22.

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoterís past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE


Since the privatization of the state oil company PETROPERU in 1996, private companies have initiated most of Peruís hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.  While Peru is now more open than ever to foreign and/or private participation, Peru has still suffered from low exploration and development drilling activity.  In light of Peruís dependence on oil imports, the lack of upstream activity has become a sensitive issue in the countryís energy sector.  President Toledo has made several efforts in 2002 to encourage oil and mining exploration by attracting more foreign oil investment in part by making investment terms more attractive and providing promotional offerings of new blocks for oil and gas exploration. The government is hopeful that its efforts will provide more incentive to U.S. and foreign companies interested in procuring E&P contracts.  

As the public entity responsible for the promotion of private capital investment in the hydrocarbon sector, PERUPETRO has asked USTDA to consider the provision of additional funds to support its exploration efforts.  The following descriptions are some of the projects under consideration:  

∑  Satellite Imagery Off-shore Exploration TA (Estimated at $480,000):  The objective of this project is to utilize satellite imagery to determine the location of hydrocarbon seeps in Peruís off-shore waters.  Seeps help provide evidence of hydrocarbon occurrences, and are associated with many major discoveries.  PERUPETRO is hopeful that this information will help to identify locations for more intensive exploration efforts.  

  ∑  On-shore Hydrocarbon Exploration TA (Estimated at $497,000):  The objective of the
  project is to identify on-shore locations that contain hydrocarbon plays, prospects and 
  leads that qualify for presentation to interested oil and gas companies.  The TA would   
  involve a geologic, geophysical and economic evaluation of prospective on-shore areas.  

 ∑   Two Database Development projects (Total Estimate of $540,000):  The objective of these projects would be to create, standardize and modernize PERUPETROís extensive database.  One project would compile and analyze gravity and magnetic data for seven hydrocarbon basins, while the second project would organize and integrate existing geologic-geochemical data and maps for PERUPETROís 18 hydrocarbon basins, utilizing modern hydrocarbon concepts and analysis.

In September 2003, USTDA obligated funds for the ìPERUPETRO Hydrocarbon Exploration Technical Assistanceî project.  The proposed projects listed above will complement the information and identified projects that result from the TA currently being funded by USTDA.  The DM contractor would also be charged with researching new opportunities in which USTDA can be of assistance.  For example, PERUPETRO has requested assistance in the development of a Business Briefing to present identified projects to interested U.S. companies.  Furthermore, PERUPETRO is also interested in technical advisory for new assignments and/or follow-on work, which will also be explored in the DM.  Under this DM assignment the contractor will be required to evaluate and recommend new projects in addition to the projects described above.

Prior to a final recommendation, the DM contractor will collaborate with the USTDA COTR to evaluate the technical, economic, and financial viability of proposed projects.  All projects must meet USTDA funding criteria in terms of a projectís U.S. export potential, environmental impact, developmental priority, foreign competition and financing potential. 

Additionally, the DM contractor will be charged with the following responsibilities:

∑	Draft a concrete, detailed terms of reference for those identified projects that meet USTDA funding requirements, and provide additional recommendations for follow-on work.  Determine whether or not TA work can/should be conducted in the U.S. or Peru, and prepare an appropriate budget for the recommended scope of work.  
∑	Evaluate and confirm the potential for possible U.S. exports, listing potential service providers and sources of hydrocarbon exploration equipment.  In light of the heavy foreign competition for E&P contracts and the procurement of equipment and consulting services, this aspect of the study will be crucial.  As such, the DM contractor will recommend follow-up business briefings, to be held in the U.S., in order to present identified exploration projects to U.S. companies and/or investors.  The DM contractor will be asked to identify companies that would be interested in attending potential briefings and/or participating as technical advisors.
∑	For the proposed TA projects that require use of a workstation, the DM contractor must confirm whether or not all the necessary data, provided by the project sponsor, PERUPETRO, is conditioned and suitable for the required tasks, and if not, include a task in the recommended TOR that addresses those concerns. 
∑	The DM contractor will address potential outcomes of proposed projects and will address all the necessary development indicators, writing a development objective for the Terms of Reference of each recommended TA, the results of which will be reported in the Final TA Report.
∑	Prepare a series of funding recommendations for USTDA and issue a Final Report.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR SOLICITATION W914NS-04-R-9003

1.	 Training for SCBA usage is not covered under SOL. I recommend that it be added to the Jordan training course. Could be accomplished in 2 days. The training to be provided is train the trainer type training.  The training to be provided is user level for both the SCBA and Breathing air compressor 

2.	Air Testing. Air quality testing is a NFPA and OSHA requirement and is required every 90 days. We can sort this out for you separately if required. Is a good idea even if not required by law as it helps maintain safe breathing standards.  Information beyond solicitation requirements may be submitted but is not required. 


3.	We work with a number of mfg of both SCBAs and Compressors and I wanted to confirm that you would allow for multiple proposals. This will allow you to get whatever product you want with the best service in the industry.  Multiple Proposals will be acceptable.

4.	RFQ does not specifically indicate that the compressors need to be installed. I see that you request turn key. Does that mean that you will provide the electrical connection if electric? Can you please clarify?  The unit shall be a fixed in place, diesel powered, the installation training will be included with the training program or the manufacturer and can install. 


5.	RFQ indicates that there is a SOW with Place of Performance. Please send this SOW. I do assume that these units will be delivered and utilized all over IRAQ. Please clarify.  The Delivery point for the equipment is Baghdad Civil Defense Warehouse (grid zone coordinates MB349858).  The Training location is still being determined and will be announced in the contract award. We can provide a place to have the training in the Green Zone.

6.	 You have indicated that delivery must take place by August 15, 2004. Is that a set date? I ask because the contracting and evaluation process normally takes a bit of time and there is the lead time with the manufacturers as well as shipping (Air Freight Being much more expensive) transportation with IRAQ (question 3) and if there is to installations (question 2) and customs hold ups to take into consideration.  The date of 15 August is just a ruff estimate as to when we would like to have the equipment in place and the offeror with the closest delivery schedule to meet that time frame will be looked at closer than others.


7.	Can equipment be shipped through the US Military system and delivered to a depot on the East Coast.  No, the shipment will need to be coordinated through your company. The two major shipping companies are FedEx or DHL.

8.	As there are no commercial flights in Baghdad and our techs all hold CAC cards; is it possible that they fly in with AMC flights until commercial flights resume? CAC card holders that are under contract are authorized military airlift.


9.	The compressor does not stipulate an enclosed SCBA fill Station. Is this a requirement?  Yes and this is identified in line item 0001. An enclosed fill station is another requirement of NFPA.

10.	Under the SCBA you have indicated 1824 complete units plus spares. Is that 1824 units with a cylinder plus 1824 spare cylinders? Yes, this is required in Line Item 0002


11.	Under the SCBA you have indicated NFPA compliance. Which NFPA do you wish to comply with as the newest requirement includes HUD (Heads-Up Display) and RIT (HP Quick Refill System) which are both very high tech, expensive and not ideally suited for firefighters that are not of extremely ìhigh techî. Please clarify. All equipment must meet related NFPA standards, most current edition of each standard. HUD and Quick fill are not high tech. They are both a requirement of the NFPA requirement. 

12.	Regarding Line Item 0004 for maintenance. Nearly all compressors require oil and filter change at 6 months, but this could be performed by anyone who has had the compressor training. Do you want us to include this in the proposal? Most other scheduled maintenance could be performed in one service round. This would also depend on exactly where the equipment would be distributed around IRAQ (question 3). Also are we to quote this to be all inclusive or would you like to have it time and material to be charged only when required for emergency call outs?
