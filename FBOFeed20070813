<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to implement recently developed sialoglycan chemistry in order to develop automated assays to measure antibodies to influenza viruses, including pandemic influenza viruses.  Current technology utilizes Red Blood Cells (RBC) in a hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay that requires manual readout. Therefore, CDC plans to acquire sialoglycan-coated beads and plates to develop a methodology to be used as a surrogate of RBC with long shelf life which is compatible with automated multiwell plate readers.  CDC will also include options to purchase a supply of essential test kits for a period of three years in order to perform antibody measurements by this approach.  This technology is expected to make it possible to study antibody responses to seasonal and emerging influenza viruses with greater speed and accuracy.  The contractor shall provide the necessary supplies and services to develop fluorescent and/or magnetic beads, quantum dots, or multiwell plates coated with sialoglycans from up to six animal sources for performing influenza virus antibody binding assays.  The solicitation is available for downloading July 6, 2007.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement to procure a training course entitled "Intro to Pro/Engineer Wildfire 3.0" The training course is designed for product designers, drafters, industrial/conceptual designers and systems designers who need to become proficient with Pro/Engineer Wildfire 3.0 as quickly as possible. Topics include sketching, part modeling, assemblies, drawings, and basic model management techniques. The training course shall accommodate twelve attendees for five consecutive days.  The training shall be conducted on-site at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and the offeror shall be responsible for providing all necessary training materials, textbooks and course materials. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase these services from Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC), 140 Kendrick Street, Needham, MA 02494.	Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons:  1) The Pro/Engineer CAD software product was developed by PTC and is proprietary to that company. 2) This is an established commercial training course that will not require tailoring to meet the Agency's needs. 3) PTC has an extensive cadre of certified instructors with a level of experience and expertise that can not be found elsewhere. 4) PTC has provided similar training in the past and is familiar with the CAD training needs of the Kennedy Space Center's Engineering Directorate. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 24, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed:  See NASA Specific Note B. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

This will be a non-personal service contract where the contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, equipment, materials, and other items to provide an after hours medical answering service.  Awardee must be prepared to handle up to 1200 calls per month on occasion, with the majority of work being 300 ? 500 calls per month. A Firm-Fixed Price contract with a fixed monthly rate is contemplated.  A contract with a base period and four (4) option years is anticipated.  Planned contract performance is base period from date of contract award to 30 June 2008 and option periods running 1 July 2008 through 30 June 2012.

Clause 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Tara Petersen, 8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103, USAFA, CO 80840, 719-333-2074, Fax 719-333-9018, email: tara.petersen@usafa.af.mil Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

7.  DESCRIPTION

The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Information Directorate, (AFRL Rome) has a requirement for research and development in the area of Information Fusion and Understanding (IFU).  IFU is defined in the broadest sense as consisting of combining information to estimate or predict that state of some aspect of the universe.  The IFU process is further characterized by a continuous refinement of estimates and assessments, and by the evaluation of the need for additional sources, the effective management or modification of the process itself, to achieve improved results.  This effort supports modern military and homeland security operations by developing revolutionary decision ? aiding capabilities to capture, manage, exploit, reason, and combine/fuse critical time sensitive information from a variety of sources.

The scope of this effort consists of performing multiple Research and Development (R&D) activities necessary to sustain a continuous process that provides world-wide situational awareness to enable decision superiority.  This innovative technology will be applied to assemble actionable information from multiple data sources in order to establish and maintain battlespace situational awareness and understanding.  This includes an understanding of adversarial capabilities and intent and the ability to locate, identify, track, and observe/monitor all friendly, enemy, non-friendly, and nonaligned forces/ actors anywhere/anytime in near real-time.  

The objective of this performance based services contract is to perform  research, development, evaluation, integration, testing, demonstration, fielding, training, and operations and maintenance of  innovative technologies and concepts to enable a continuous assessment of global conditions and events.  

Specifically this effort will investigate technological approaches to help achieve a heightened state of shared situational awareness, understanding and knowledge among all elements of a Joint force, in conjunction with Allied and coalition partners.  The goal is to employ new innovative technology concepts to help achieve situational dominance and dramatically increase survivability, lethality, speed, timeliness, and responsiveness.  Innovative fusion technologies and capabilities will be developed and delivered using multiple strategic, tactical and intelligence sources to identify and overcome critical weaknesses, and enable the warfighter to proactively anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess any target, any where, at any time.  New approaches, techniques, and the development of software tools will be accomplished to provide adaptive multi-platform, multi-level, multi-intelligence reasoning and fusion systems to support the need of today's warfighter.

Anticipated deliverables include final technical reports, experimental software, hardware, technical documentation and training of innovative technologies.

An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)-CPFF/Completion type contract with a period performance of 60 months is anticipated.  Multiple Awards are anticipated (estimate appropriately 3 awards).  The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $49,900,000.00 for all contracts combined.

The BPAs will be for service within the NORTHCOM AOR (to include Alaska and near off-shore), within the SOUTHCOM AOR, between SOUTHCOM and NORTHCOM, between USAFE (to include Greenland) and the CONUS, and between PACAF and the CONUS.  The air carrier and medical crew must be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS).  Aircraft utilized shall be contractor-furnished, fixed-wing, jet aircraft, configured to air ambulance standards.  An offer will not be considered unless the offeror is an air taxi operator within the meaning of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (19 USC 1301) as amended.  To be awarded a BPA for this service, prospective offerors must satisfy all DOD Commercial Air Carrier Quality and Safety Requirements as described in 32 CFR, Part 861.3; however, non-DoD approved carriers may transport passengers for medical transport services under emergency conditions to save life, limb, or eyesight only when no DoD approved carrier is available to perform.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price contract to Comtech EF Data, 2114 W. 7th Street, Tempe, AZ 85281-7227.  This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  The DJC2 IPC suite is modeled after the DISA suite C architecture to fulfill compatibility requirements with DISA and connectivity to the STEP/Teleports.  The DJC2 IPC production baseline currently utilizes the Comtech TurboIP Performance Enhan!  cement Proxy (PEP) and it will continue to be used on DJC2 systems 5 and 6.  Comtech is the sole manufacturer of the PEProxy currently used in the DJC2 IPC system and the DISA suite C architecture.  Training, manuals, drawings, and operation documents for this suite are currently in place and or are being produced to support the war fighter.  These products will be able to be re-used for DJC2 systems 5 and 6.  The use of this specific PEP, which is also being used in DISAs suite C and approved by DISA, ensures compatibility between the DJC2 system and DISAs Teleport/STEP sites.  It will also ensure better compatibility between DJC2 and other DOD IP communication systems.  Equipment purchased on this requisition is production representative.  These are the fifth and sixth deliveries of a standardized, configuration-managed system.  The DJC2 Acquisition Strategy defines this approach during this increment of the system, in order to maximize the potential for product imp!  rovements on current part numbers from the rapidly evolving world of i nformation technology.

As the government shareholder in these companies, SCIC is responsible for monitoring and investing its capital based on market mechanisms and promoting strategies in support of market development and economic growth in Vietnam.

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source, non-competitive basis for consulting services to:
						
Charles Gunzburg
24237 Clematis Drive
Gaithersburg, MD 20882-3821

The proposed action is to meet the continued demand for expertise for the compliance program for diagnostic x-ray products which evolved from an inspection based program to a surveillance program based on field testing of newly installed units.  The basic needs of this program have changed along with the complexity and risk of the products regulated under this program.  In order to implement the current Radiological Health Program Plan, a change to a factory inspection based plan is indicated along with the realization that this plan must continue to be reviewed to ensure it sufficiently deals with current generation products.  Knowledge of factory inspections along with current product knowledge is needed to produce a compliance plan adapted to the new risk based enforcement strategy in the current plan. 

Diagnostic x-ray equipment is regulated under both Subchapter C  Electronic
Product Radiation Control(formerly the Radiation Control for Health and Safety
Act of 1968) and Subchapter A   Drugs and Devices of
Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).   Subchapter C provides authority to require product recalls for noncompliant or defective radiation emitting electronic products.  In addition, Subchapter A
(as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act) provides authority to require
product recalls for medical devices that may cause a serious risk to health.  (All
diagnostic (medical) x-ray products are medical devices.)  When there is a
choice, regulatory/administrative action is preferred under Subchapter C, but
both portions of the FDCA may be used in conjunction for maximum
effectiveness.

In this capacity, there is a need for an individual that can 1) recognize basic medical physics principles associated with radiation protection, x-ray production, x-ray circuitry, and x-ray equipment performance; 2) identify key requirements of Subchapter C - Electronic Product Radiation Control of Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the associated regulations of not only Subchapter A but also Subchapter J ? Radiological Health of Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations as they relate to Diagnostic X-Ray Systems; 3) can address testing procedures of radiographic and fluoroscopic x-ray systems; and 4) recognize the process used by the Food and Drug Administration in the regulation of the manufacturer, assembler, and user of Diagnostic X-Ray Systems. This expertise will ensure CDRHs ability to develop guidance and training that will address the needs of State officials and FDA investigators who perform testing of diagnostic x-ray systems for compliance with Federal Performance Standard 21 CFR 1020.30-1020.32. 

Mr. Gunzburg has over 30 years experience with the x-ray area including first hand knowledge of factory inspections, field measurements and the compliance program.  He is uniquely qualified to analyze the needs of a new factory inspection program due to his experience in performing these in the past and his ability to incorporate the 30 years of knowledge of the evolving industry and products coupled with his knowledge of radiation risk.  He is ideally suited to generate the plan for inspection along with the training needed to educate ORA field personnel to successfully perform the inspections.  Additionally, he has been active with the mammography program since its inception.  He is an expert on the facility inspection function and is ideally suited to instruct, counsel and test student inspectors.  He is also an expert in both the x-ray compliance and mammography inspection programs. 
 
Mr. Gunzburg brings an in-depth knowledge of the CDRH Programs and regulatory requirements as well as established relationships with the Division of Mamography Quality Radiation Program (DMQRP), other supporting OCER organizations and Industry.  In addition, the consultant has an expert working knowledge of the Model 204 computer application, which is a database management system in which access structures, programs and data are stored together.  This system has its own user language, and has relationships that are based solely on the value of data; relating two or more records requiring the existence of common data values within the records thus allowing hierarchical and network relationships to be supported by the commonality of data characteristic.
 
Mr. Gunzburg's education, experience and existing relationships with Industry and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and expert knowledge of the regulations to be addressed and M204 system provides unique expertise and allows for a continuity necessary to efficiently achieve program objectives.  This is a substantial advantage and efficiency, and it  can be reasonably asserted that not only to identify, but to award, to any other source will unnecessarily retard efforts to effectively and efficiently accomplish the goals and requirements of the program and its initiatives. Because of this experience and knowledge, Mr. Gunzburg will need no training thus, only Mr. Gunzburg will be able to perform the identified work and will be able to complete the identified tasks in the time allotted.  

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to darren.jansen@fda.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.  An award will be made in fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

The contractor will also continue to provide associated educational outreach.  Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government, the need for consistency and compatibility in evaluation methods, and unnecessary delays in completing the anticipated genes render competition unfeasible.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Building and Fire Research Laboratory, Construction Metrology and Automation Group intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Mesa Imaging AG, of Zurich, Switzerland for a Range Camera to be part of the ongoing object tracking research at NIST.

The sensor will be used in calibration and characterization experiments, for object detection in regards to obstacle detection, object tracking, and navigation for construction equipment and cranes. Currently, NIST is performing two projects that require this equipment. Additionally, NIST is performing ongoing and active research requiring the enhanced features that this equipment provides. The higher frame rate is required to permit the robot to servo on the position of a moving target. Our need for a daylight sensor is obvious for construction related applications. 

Sole source determination is based on the following: The solid state, prototype, range camera (Model Swiss Ranger SR3000) offered by Mesa Imaging AG in Zurich Switzerland is the only large Focal Plane Array (FPA) Time-Of- Flight (TOF) system that is able to meet all of our requirements to perform the projects currently in process. These requirements are shown below.

Range Camera Requirements:

Requirement:					
FPA Size (176x144).	
Reason:
Need maximum available FPA size to provide as many range data points and image pixels for object recognition research.

Requirement:
Frame rate (~ 30 Hz).
Reason:
Need maximum frame-rate for object tracking applications.

Requirement:
cm-level range resolution.
Reason:
Need at least cm-level range resolution for target object position and orientation calculation.

Requirement:
Small instrument size. 
(volume & weight)
Reason:
Instrument will be mounted on a pan & tilt on a mobile robot.  Small package size is necessary.

Requirement:
Both range and intensity image outputs.
Reason:
Needed for object recognition and tracking approach.

Requirement:
Eyesafe.
Reason:
Operating in an unrestricted, human-occupied environment.

Requirement:
Standardized USB interface with Windows/Linux/Mac drivers.
Reason:
Ease of system integration.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by August 23, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Porter Novelli, 1909 K St., NW, Washington, DC 20066 for public perceptions and responses to scientific uncertainty regarding controversial cancer screening.  How the public perceives and responds to scientific uncertainty over new cancer screening technologies and other controversial medical interventions is an issue of growing importance, given the increasingly rapid emergence and diffusion of innovations in cancer control, the expanding emphasis on evidence-based medicine and informed decision making, and the heightened visibility of scientific controversies over various cancer screening technologies.  Yet little is known about how scientific uncertainty affects people.  The proposed procurement will facilitate this study by adding select questions to a large national consumer and physician survey, and obtaining the data once the surveys are fielded to perform the study. The data source for this project consists of two surveys conducted by Porter Novelli.  The first, ?HealthStyles,? is a national panel-based mail survey administered annually since 1995.  This survey aims at understanding the U.S. public?s health orientations and practices, and represents part of a larger survey of the public?s consumer habits, ?ConsumerStyles,? which is sent to 20,000 potential respondents who receive monetary incentives for participation.  The sample is stratified on region, household income, population density, age, and household size in order to create a nationally representative sample, with over-sampling of low-income, minority, and households with children.  The average response rate for ConsumerStyles is 60% (approximately 12,000 completed surveys), and HealthStyles is mailed to half of these participants; final sample size for HealthStyles has been approximately 4,100.  The second survey is ?DocStyles,? a web-administered panel-based survey first conducted in 2005, which samples approximately 1000 primary care physicians (family practitioners and internists, response rate 61%), and aimed at identifying physicians? lifestyle counseling practices.  The 2007 surveys contain items of interest related to the objectives of the current study, and specifically measuring both the general public?s and physicians? perceptions and attitudes towards scientific uncertainty regarding controversial cancer screening and preventive interventions. Porter Novelli is the only source known to the NCI Research that can provide the data necessary for the NCI to conduct the proposed analysis for the types of sample sizes necessary to support the research aims stated above.  HealthStyles and DocStyles represent already-existing national survey efforts that are developed and administered by Porter Novelli.  The data that comes out of these surveys is proprietary and wholly owned by Porter Novelli, and not available from any other existing national survey or database.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service they may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 22, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register. In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 has a requirement for carrying out a series of  tests with a photo-EMF pulsed laser vibrometer (PPLV) and providing technical  support and assistance in carrying out these tests at locations to be  determined by ARDEC, Picatinny. The PPLV will be used to monitor variations in  the vibration spectrum of the vehicle in this program. The PPLV is a remote,  non-contact interrogation measure that is invisible to the drivers of suspect  vehicles and hence will not arouse their suspicions when compared to other  contact, visually intrusive sensing technologies. Furthermore, thanks to its  excellent sensitivity in surface vibration monitoring, the PPLV can detect  accurately variations in the vibration spectrum of the vehicle when it is  subject to external perturbations like passing the vehicle through a speed  bump. The very unique advantage of optical speckle tolerance of the PPLV also  allows it to be applied to all kinds of vehicles regardless of its surface  conditions while allowing them to travel with relatively higher speeds. The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel to carry out the tests and  tasks described herein. The Contractor shall be responsible for the operation of the sensors and shall  remove the sensors from the test site at the conclusion of the tests.  The Contractor shall identify the range of vibration characteristics, including  the vibration frequencies and amplitudes, expected out of the range of vehicles  of interest.  The Contractor shall determine the corresponding system parameter values of the  PPLV. The Contractor assemble the PPLV with the desired performance metrics. The Contractor shall perform baseline measurement of vehicle vibration spectrum  in the absence of external mechanical loads using PPLV. The Contractor shall investigate variations in the vehicleâs vibration spectrum  in the presence of mechanical loads using PPLV. The Contractor shall correlate the PPLV readout with various amounts of  excessive mechanical load imposed onto the vehicle. The Contractor shall analyze recorded experimental data and prepare a final  report. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Sole Source contract in the  amount of $13,000 to Brimrose Corporation of America, located at 19 Loveton  Circle, Sparks, MD 21152-9201, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)(A),  as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No  Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This sole source  position is predicated on Brimrose Corporation of Americaâs unique capabilities  that are required for testing the remote-sensing Photo-EMF Pulsed Laser  Vibrometer they have been developing with the purpose of monitoring variations  in the vibration spectrum of a vehicle as one of the possible indicators of a  Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED). Therefore, the efforts to be  performed under this contract can only be accomplished by Brimrose Corporation  of America and its personnel.  All responsible sources, however, may submit a proposal that shall be  considered by the agency.  Please submit your responses via email only, no  later than August 28, 2007 12pm EST to Ms. Morgan Ross,  morgan.ross@us.army.mil.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this synopsis or otherwise pay for information  solicited.  See Numbered Note 22.

<RESPDATE>091207
<ARCHDATE>11112007
<CONTACT>LARRY LEAHY, (309) 782-3723
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential production sources for the MK161 Percussion Primer NSN 1390-00-488-1018 for Foreign Military Sale (FMS). The item is utilized in propelling charges for the following 76mm cartr idges: MK199, MK200, MK201, MK202, and MK208. The item is threaded into the base of a cartridge case and tightened to a specific torque. The propelling charge is initiated by the gun firing pin contacting the primer [firing] plug, which transfers the percu ssion impulse to a percussion element, which ignites a chemical composition that in turn ignites the black powder charge. The flame from the black powder charge is vented through holes in the primer tube that then ignites the propellant charge in the cartr idge case. Potential manufacturers should have experience in handling explosives and static sensitive explosive components. Black powder is a hygroscopic material and moisture will degrade performance. Hang-fires or misfires will significantly reduce syste m effectiveness and could result in damage to the gun or injury to personnel. The estimated FMS quantity is 20,000 for FY08. Interested contractors should identify company size, descriptive information on the company, manufacturing capabilities (equipment,  capacities, facilities, critical skills possessed), and past performance on percussion primers or other similar items. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost obligation incurred to the Government. The Government at its discretion and without explanation may choose not to purchase all or part of the item described herein. All interested sources are requested to submit responses, but only in writing with clear and convincing documentation by close of 30 days after the date released. This synopsis serves as a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small busines s programs. The technical data package (TDP) is classified as Distribution D and is restricted as such. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Export Controls Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751 ET SEQ) or the Export Administration  Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50 U.S.C. APP 2240, ET SEQ). Technical data and drawings are available upon request. Interested parties must contact Gary Gray to request a copy of the TDP via E-mail gary.gray@navy.mil. The request must include: Cage Code, Company Name, Address, Phone Number, E-mail address, and Point of Contact. Please email the response no later than September 12, 2007 to the U.S. Army Sustainment Command, Larry Leahy, email: lawrence.leahy1@us.army.mil

<SUBJECT>A--Crash Mishap Analysis
<SOLNBR>W911W6-07-C-0042
<RESPDATE>092707
<ARCHDATE>11262007
<CONTACT>Katherine Kearney, 7578785703
<DESC>This is a synopsis for a non-commercial program entitled, Crash Mishap Analysis. The objective of this effort is to investigate historical trends in rotorcraft crashes and develop analytical methods to correlate rotorcraft characteristics to crash performance.  This effort will be used to provide input into improving a crashworthiness standard that accommodates the fullest spectrum of operating weight and environment conditions for all classes of rotorcraft.  Current generation aircraft crashworthin ess is based on technologies and guidelines developed in the Vietnam War era, based on field data available on Vietnam-generation aircraft.  This guidance is limited to metal airframes impacting on prepared surfaces.  Increasing aircraft velocities and Mis sion Gross Weight (MGW) have severely reduced the effectiveness of these features.  Mishap data also shows that the majority of crashes do not occur on prepared surfaces.  The intent of the mishap data analysis effort is to correlate different variables, s uch as aircraft design (Mission Weight, Gross Weight, rotor blade disk loading, fuselage design) and environmental effects (impact surface, mission altitude) with crash survivability performance.  The results of this analysis will feed into a larger Full S pectrum Crashworthiness (FSC) project that will investigate current system level crashworthiness criteria and develop revisions, based on mishap data, relevant system approaches and technologies, as necessary to provide a crashworthiness standard that acco mmodates the fullest spectrum of operating weight and environment conditions for all classes of rotorcraft.  The proposed effort will use historical data to analyze crash performance from a historical perspective due to variability with respect to aircraft  class, missions, configurations, operating weight and environment conditions.  Subject to availability of funding, a sole source award to SAFE Inc., per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements is planned.  There would be considerable duplication of cost and schedule incurred if this effort is undertaken with a source other than SAFE Inc.  SAFE Inc. have personnel with historical familiarity with the characteristi cs and history of post-Vietnam helicopter type incidents and the historical and practical problems of crashes and how to identify meaningful trends from the mass of Government data.  The key personnel employed at SAFE Inc have been part of crashworthiness research and product development for the specific helicopters this effort applies to for several decades.  They have the familiarity with the mass of Government data that was used to produce an analysis conducted during a rotorcraft mishap analysis effort that was performed during execution of the Survivable Affordable Repairable Airframe Program (SARAP) Technology Maturation and Trade Study (TM&TS) effort.  The Government does not have the report from that effort with sufficient rights to make it available  to interested parties.  The key personnel who performed the previous, relavant analysis are widely regarded as experts in this subject area and based upon market research, no equivalent expertise is readily available other than at SAFE Inc.  The familiari ty with the previous research data, research findings, and review feedback on the report of findings resides solely with the personnel already familiar with the previous analysis who are employed by SAFE, Inc.  The previous analysis involved extensive rese arch and synthesis of a large volume of Government-furnished historical crash mishap data.  The synthesis of these data into a product identifying meaningful trends and formulating industry-accepted comparisons with 1970s era data sets and previous mishap  analysis studies involved many months of analysis and review. Only SAFE Inc. is at this point capable of providing the required analysis at a reasonable cost  in a reasonable time, and with the required degree of confidence in supporting background knowledge and professional independence.  The unique expertise and familiarity is available from SAFE, Inc., and therefore deemed unavailable from any other source w ithout substantial duplication of cost likely consuming all existing funding just climbing the learning curve to get where SAFE already is.  The mishap analysis requirement is an important piece of the larger FSC effort and the schedule available for compl etion of this requirement does not allow personnel to duplicate the experince and background knowledge already in place.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be awarded to SAFE Inc., who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable o f meeting this requirement.  This acquisition will be conducted pursuant to the terms of FAR Parts 6 and 15.   Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Safe Inc.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and Safe Inc., consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  W hile the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be address to AATD, ATTN:  AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Katherine Kearney), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA   23604-5577.  Ms. Kearneys phone number is 757-878-5703.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address (Data fax 757-878-0008) or katt.kearney@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Questions

There is a note on 3A-403, which states ?Install one new sign @ all existing doors on corridors?.

Does the government intend for the contractor to install new signs at the pair of stairwell doors and/or South Wing corridor? If so, will signs go on both sides of the door according to the detail? 

 

 See addendum #2

 

In the renovation notes: No. 23 states to ?Install new hardware after refinishing door, see specs?. With all the existing doors to be refinished on the West Wing, 1st floor the hardware specs only identify men?s (104) and women?s (108) bathrooms to install Hardware Set 6. 

Does the government intend for the contractor to replace any other hardware sets after doors are refinished on any other floor on the east and west wings? 

 

 See addendum #2

 

The hardware schedule identifies hardware sets to be installed on the following doors: 1. HW Set 2-Door 100b, 2. HW Set 6 ? Door 110 & 110a. Doors and frames at 110a and 110b is for Comm Room 110a. Should Hardware Set 2 be installed on Door 110a and 110b? 

 

 See addendum #2
. On floor plans 101, 102, and 103 (not on 104) there is plan symbol "E" at the "pair opening" leading to existing stair "work not in contract".  Are these required?  If so, additional hardware must be indicated since all other "E" symbol doors will receive a new lockset only and these pairs need fire exit devices due to their location. 

 

See addendum #2 

 

b.  Section 08710 - Finish hardware has many hardware sets with many doors numbered therein.  For the new openings at alcove and communications these doors are listed under SET 6 which is for a single opening.  The pair openings at communication require additional items and should be listed under SET 11 most likely.  All new door nos. on the plans were not found listed in the hardware sets. 

 

 See addendum #2 

 

c.  Section 10800 - Toilet accessories has many items listed, named, etc.  But the plans indicate only new toilet tissue dispensers, grab bars, and mirrors to be installed.  Are these other items required? 

 

Only the items listed above.

PRESOLICITATION NOTICE for FA8601-07-R-0045, Project Number ZHTV 050033B,  Repair 2nd Floor Fire Suppression/HVAC-Phase II ABW HQ , Facility 30010,  Area C,  WPAFB.  Period of Performance is 365 days. The overall estimated  price range is between $ 1M and $ 5M. The solicitation is an unrestricted  acquisition, full-and-open competition. In accordance with DFARS  252.204-704 Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), Contractor  must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesnt currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1. The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available  on the World Wide Web on or about 22 June 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. 2.

Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support thn on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractors facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractors Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractors Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractors Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractors  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.

Question:  Regarding the SOO requirement for a two week site survey at  the nine bases, what is the actual requirement for performance of this  survey? Answer:  The requirement is to verify specific differing site conditions  at each of the nine bases, taking into account training classrooms at each  site as well as the availability of a 2500 foot runway.  9  Question:  Will the TAF require us to provide a report of potential  obstructions and location of possible landing areas or is the survey more  of a get acquainted visit without a physical survey? Answer:  A physical site survey is required but no report is needed after  the conclusion of the site survey. 10. Question:  Per CLIN 0005AB Program Management Review #1, what is the  planned location for the first PMR? Answer:  Taipei Taiwan For more information on "Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS) for  Taiwan Air Force (TAF)", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5312

<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:<br>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) for a vacant parcel of land of at least 300 to 600 acres.<br><br>

The intended use of the leased land is to provide storage for approximately 40,000 travel trailers and/or mobile homes which were used by the Louisiana Housing Task Force as temporary emergency housing units (EHU) to those individuals displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  These EHU will not be occupied.<br><br>

FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governmental technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  In making a determination, the GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies' guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the site.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for the intended use by the Government.  Those individuals responding with an expression of interest that meet these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the SFO will be considered for award.<br><br>

Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br><br>

1.	Land which is located within the specified delineated area.<br>
2.	Parcels of Land no smaller than 300 and no larger than 600 acres.<br>
3.	Land that is flat and hard-surfaced (no loose soil), cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to support travel trailers and mobile homes.<br>
4. 	Land owner will allow FEMA's placement of gravel/rock on roadways and lanes on the property with possible culvert/piping to make property more accessible and conducive to staging travel trailers and mobile homes.<br>
5.	Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads.  Preference is for land with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads.<br>
6.	Land that is near water, sewerage and electric service is preferred.<br>
7.	Land that is not wetlands.<br>
8.	Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements, and any other necessary approvals fro government intended use.<br>
9.	Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations.<br><br>
The expression of interest should include, as a minimum, the following information: <br><br>

1.	Owner name, address, phone number, fax number, and email address if available.<br>
2.	Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land (e.g. copy of deed, mortgage document, or master lease stating the ability to sublease for the government?s intended use).<br>
3.	A legal description of the property.<br>
4.	Description of the land:  size (number of acres), physical characteristics, past and current use.<br>
5.	Location of the land:  including the municipal (physical) address, city, parish, and a small map showing the location and access to the property.<br>
6.	Picture of the site.<br>
7.	If representing an owner, a written agreement with the owner showing authority to represent the owner.<br><br>

All expressions of interest shall be addressed as follows and mailed to:<br><br>
General Services Administration<br> 
Expression of Interest to Vacant Land<br>
3535 S. Sherwood Forest Blvd., Suite 150<br>
Baton Rouge, LA 70816<br><br>

SOLICITATION PROCESS:<br><br>
Typically, GSA will solicit offers from all technically acceptable sites.  Site acceptability will be established by the process of determination described above and within the Solicitation for Offer.  The leasing action will be awarded to the lowest price technically acceptable offer.<br><br>

DELINEATED AREA:<br><br><bold>
Property offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within the following delineated area from the city center of Baton Rouge, LA:<br>
North and West - within a 50 mile radius<br>
South - within 25 mile radius<br>
East - along I-12 to Highway 21 Northeast to Pearl River and North to the Mississippi State Line.<br><br>

LEASE TERM:<br><br>
A 2-year lease with a 1- year firm term. <br><br>

RENTAL RATE:<br><br>
An annual rate of return on the estimated value of the selected site is offered as a lease rental payment.  The Government will not accept an increased value assessment or an excessive interest rate due to the nature of this requirement.  The intent of the Government is not to operate a commercial business on the property and, therefore, there is no income for consideration in determining a fair rental rate.<br><br>

RIGHT-OF-ENTRY FORM:<br><br>
The owner will be required to provide access and entry onto the property to FEMA and its representatives for the purpose of performance of environmental and other assessment to determine technical feasibility for intended use.<br>

The construction plan will take into account maintenance projects to maintain utilities in order to provide appropriate healthcare. 	The plan is required to have four sections: 1.

Changes in capital asset use may include modifying the physical layout of health care and administrative services, consolidation of excess space with cost savings achieved and identification of each project required to further integrate services to a single seamless system.

A/E shall be allowed to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information requested.  AutoCAD files will be reasonably complete and accurate but A/E will make minor revisions as necessary.

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory has developed a special filter to be mounted in the rear sight of an aiming system. This filter has similar focusing properties to refraction lenses, but with more than one focal length. In this application, a first and second focal length would be regulated to bring both the front sight and target into simultaneous focus. Use of this lens allows for better alignment and improved accuracy for the sighting system user. Current single lens sights cannot provide a clear view of both the front sight and target.

Technology Highlights:
?	Single lens 
?	Rear sight mounted 
?	Provides simultaneous clear focus on front sight and target


The INL is soliciting a written indication of interest from industry manufacturing partners interested in a license agreement for the purpose of manufacturing and commercializing this technology.  

Interested manufacturers should respond by September 13, 2007.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their ability to manufacture and commercialize this technology to the contact listed below.  Any questions or inquiries should be directed to the contact listed below.

Screening information allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offers are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) who will evaluate each response received and makes a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is  for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing. Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business (4:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time) on September 4, 2007 THIS ACQUISITION IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS BUSINESS CONCERNS (SB).

<DESC>The United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) intends to award a sole-source award to MilleGen-Prologue Biotech for the screening of a phage display library of chicken scFv and production of 50 positive clones as soluble scFv.  CBER is seeking sources capable of producing 50 German cockroach specific scFvs.  This work will be done as part of the development of the multiplex allergen extract potency assay (MAPA).  The purpose of MAPA is to assess the overall potency of complex allergen mixtures. CBER is currently in the process of developing and optimizing MAPA for less complex allergen mixtures and are ready to move into more complex mixtures such as the cockroach allergen extract. The development of this assay will be an important step towards analyzing the allergenicity of cockroach extract as well as many other extracts currently on the market that do not have a standard of potency. The source(s) must be able to 1) Develop Phage Display Screening Conditions, 2) Perform 5 cycles of phage display panning and characterize selected binders by: a) ELISA analysis of 576 scFv clones and b) Sequencing of the 120 best scFvs, 3) Produce 0.1-0.3 mg scFv, and 4) Characterize binding profile of 50 scFv clones by ELISA. Interested parties must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting a) a brief statement of interest, b) company name and point of contact and phone number, c) web-site and email address, and d) a brief description of how they meet each of the requirements listed above. Please do not exceed five pages. This request for information is not a request for competitive proposals. Copies of proposals sent will NOT be honored or acknowledged. Please send questions and information electronically to London.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov.  If FDA is unable to identify any sources capable of providing the screening of a phage display library of chicken scFv and production of 50 positive clones as soluble scFv, an award will be made to MilleGen-Prologue Biotech.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) located in Miami, FL intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for a project field manager in a port sampling project to collect fishery catch and biostatistical samples in the U.S. Virgin Islands on a sole source basis from Dr. David Olsen, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands based on the following:  1) Dr. Olsen has extensive background associated with conducting research and managing the reef fish stocks of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Previously Dr. Olsen served as director of the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW) between 1980 and 1982 and since 2006 is again currently serving as Director; 2) From 2004 to the present date, Dr. Olsen served as executive Director of the St. Thomas Fishermen?s Association (STFA), providing technical support and management of Association grants and projects; 3) Dr. Olsen has participated in extensive fishery research on tropical fisheries, and set up the territory-wide fishery statistic reporting system in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  In addition, while serving as Director of the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) Division of Fish and Wildlife he served as the principal investigator for all of the territory?s fish and wildlife research and development programs, ensured effective coordination between commercial and recreational fishing interests and local/federal agencies; 4) Dr. Olsen also served as the USVI Government representative to the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC).  His knowledge of the regional fisheries and his experience in interacting with the local fisher groups enhance probability of the project?s success in obtaining access to these important fisheries samples; 5) Dr. Olsen?s technical background and scientific skills will provide the required expertise needed to manage this project.  He is familiar with the necessary field procedures used by the SESFC for recording fishery catch samples and he is trained and knowledgeable in the importance of acquiring reliable samples from the fisheries.  To this regard Dr. Olsen is known and highly regarded by the local fisher community and access to the fisher samples for sampling will be greatly aided by this factor; 6) Dr. Olson?s ability to train technical staff to be used in the field is an important facet of this project.  In addition he resides in the USVI and utilizing a staff already residing in the USVI and established with the DFW will enhance the project?s success and minimize time required to initiate port sampling.  The ability to use Dr. Olsen and DFW staff who are known by local fishers, knowledgeable of the local fishing operations, landing and market sites, and very familiar with weather will add to the overall project success. 

Project objectives:

1)	 Maintain fish stocks at or above the level that would support the maximum sustainable yield on a continuing basis.
2)	Eliminate over-fishing and rebuild over-fished stocks important to commercial , recreational, and subsistence fisheries.

The primary objectives of this project are for samplers to conduct dockside bio-statistical sampling of commercial reef fish trips (fish traps and hook and line trips)  in St. Thomas and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  The data collected from port sampling activities of the multi species reef fish fishery will provide critically needed fishery statistics on landings per trip by species, trip species composition, and catch length frequency for fish traps and hook and line fisheries in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The port sampling effort from this project will fill short term needs in St. Thomas and supplement the existing sampling effort in St. Croix.

Anticipated performance period is date of award through one year.

POC:	Angela Munro, Contract Specialist, e-mail: angela.munro@navy.mil 
	
This notice constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) as contemplated by FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii).  
  

AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,     
TEST & EVALUATION (RDT&E) PROJECTS

I.  	INTRODUCTION:

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) is seeking to learn about industry?s Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) ideas for aircraft survivability. It is hoped some of these ideas may be of interest to the JASP community and result in future JASP project proposals.  This RFI is being issued now to allow time to learn about and discuss your ideas and locate potential contracting avenues prior to our deadline for FY09 project proposals in December 2007. 

II.	BACKGROUND:

Originally chartered as the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Aircraft Survivability (JTCG/AS), the JASP has been actively pursuing technologies to support aircraft survivability and coordinate aircraft related survivability issues between the Services for over 30 years. The JASP is a government funded program reporting to the Office of Secretary of Defense/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD/DOT&E) and chartered by the Services aviation systems commands.  The day-to-day operation of the JASP is under the direction of the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO).  JASP is a tri-Service program whose mission is to achieve increased affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of aircraft through the joint coordination and development of survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability reduction) technologies and assessment methodologies. 

Annually, JASP issues a call for project ideas (proposals) and funds approximately $3M in new start projects and $6M in continuing projects.  JASP projects typically last 1-3 years and receive between $100-200K per year with a potential maximum funding level of $500K per year.  A key tenant of the JASP program is the leveraging of JASP funding with funding from other organizations. 
 
JASP issues its call for project proposals via e-mail to DoD agencies.   JASP does not directly fund contractor efforts but provides funding to DoD agencies for project management and contracting, thus the requirement for DoD sponsorship.  Contractors may elect to and are encouraged to directly contact appropriate DoD agencies for sponsorship at any time, in addition to any consideration due to this announcement.


III. 	SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:

The JASP RDT&E effort is organized into three subgroups: Susceptibility Reduction, Vulnerability Reduction and Survivability Assessment (Modeling & Simulation). The JASP is interested in RDT&E initiatives that will enhance the combat survivability of both manned and unmanned aircraft.  Its principal focus is Science and Technology (S&T) for advanced technology/component development and demonstration RDT&E (6.3) as well as improving the JASP?s modeling and simulation tool set.  Areas of particular interest are listed below by subgroup category:
Susceptibility Reduction

Advanced development proof-of-design concepts are sought that will offer clear, quantifiable benefits in reducing the probability of military aircraft being hit by enemy fire.  Such concepts should lead to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or 6 and may range from ideas for improving operational suitability of existing susceptibility reduction systems (cost and weight reduction, increased reliability) to ideas for entirely new capabilities.  Proposals from across the spectrum of susceptibility reduction technologies are invited (e.g., IR, visual, acoustic signature reduction) but the JASP has particular interest in the following:

?	Technologies or concepts that, if developed successfully, would significantly benefit operational units in the near-term by solving an existing problem (e. g., IR decoy flares that reduce an aircraft?s visual signature without impairing countermeasures effectiveness).
?	Technologies or concepts that will defeat current and future generation IR threats such as MANPADs, imaging IR seekers, and infrared search and track systems.  Such technologies or concepts include low cost approaches to IR missile countermeasures and warning or entirely new concepts.
?	Technologies or concepts that will counter advanced coherent, parameter-agile radar threats employed against both manned and unmanned military aircraft.  Threats could include advanced radars and passive radars.  Technologies could include electronic attack and electronic protection techniques.
?	Technologies that improve blue force survivability through increased Situational Awareness (SA).  Although the benefits of enhanced SA are difficult to quantify, technologies that improve SA have the potential to increase the effectiveness of existing Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), as well as improve or modify Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) (e.g., Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) for gunfire).

Vulnerability Reduction

Emphasis should be on technologies/techniques that increase an aircraft?s capability to withstand the man-made hostile environment (holistic approach to threat tolerance or aircraft hardening).  A balance between technologies/techniques that are breakthrough in nature (with potentially high risk, high payoff gains) and technologies/techniques that are mature enough to transition into near-term, fieldable systems is desired.  Areas include, but are not limited to: 

?	Opaque and transparent ballistic protection systems
?	Crew and passenger protection (non-armor)
?	Fuel containment protection for tanks and lines
?	Fire suppression/extinguishing systems (passive and active)
?	Damage tolerant & repairable subsystems
?	Advanced materials development
Survivability Assessment

Improve the capability and credibility of government-owned survivability Models and Simulations (M&S), focusing on M&S residing in the Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC).  Other M&S providing capabilities beyond those of the SURVIAC are also of interest, and will be considered on a case by case basis.

?	CAPABILITY:
o	Robust signature, countermeasure and environment modeling
o	Vulnerability phenomena of conventional, unconventional and asymmetric threats
o	Authoritative blue system performance data (including vulnerability)
o	Integration of authenticated threat models from the Intelligence Centers
o	Transition legacy M&S to Threat Modeling and Analysis Program (TMAP) M&S

?	CREDIBILITY:
o	Compare SURVIAC models results against open-air range data, or other authoritative data to confirm/increase credibility
o	Sensitivity studies to better understand assumptions and limitations of survivability models, and provide input to investment strategies

IV.   	SUBMISSION OF PROJECT IDEAS:
This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) but rather a Request for Information (RFI) on your current survivability RDT&E and other ideas that may be of interest to the JASP.  This will be the only JASP request for survivability RDT&E ideas prior to the project proposals call to DoD agencies in September 2007. 
NAVAIRSYSCOM will acknowledge receipt of your response and forward to the appropriate JASPO subgroup Technical Point of Contact (TPOC).  The JASPO will review submitted responses for compatibility with the JASP mission and at their discretion, contact the submitter for further information.  When an idea is deemed of sufficient interest to the Government, the submitter (or their selected representatives) may be invited to submit a FY09 project proposal for possible JASP funding.  

You are required to follow the instructions provided in this notice for the submittal.  Packages will be forwarded by the Contracts Office to the appropriate POCs for Susceptibility Reduction, Vulerability Reduction and Survivability Assessments. 

SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS:

All proprietary portions of the project idea package shall be clearly identified and will be treated in the strictest confidence. Submissions are limited to US participation and must be unclassified.  

Submissions are not to exceed twelve (12) pages using a contractor selected format and must clearly state the subgroup intended (as identified above) so it may be forwarded to the appropriate TPOC.  Submissions shall be sent electronically (MS Word, PDF or MS PowerPoint format) to angela.munro@navy.mil .  Confirmation of receipt is recommended for electronic submission.    If the Government intends to pursue a specific submission, the vendor will be notified in writing of this intent.  IF THE PACKAGE IS GREATER THAN 15MB, A ZIP FORMAT IS REQUIRED.  

The Government is not liable for any costs associated with submissions or any subsequent requests for project proposals or briefings.

<CONTACT>Mark Hopkins, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-245-6128, Fax 202-245-6296, Email Mark.Hopkins@ed.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education intends to award a contract to Unisys and its subcontractors, EMTEL and Enzenia, Inc. for the establishment of an External Emergency Communication System for the Department.  The purpose of this contract is to provide the U.S. Department of Education (DoED) with a multiple (i.e. web, landline, fax, cellular and wireless capacity) communication system through which emergency and non-emergency notifications, information and/or guidance can be sent to public and private state and local educational agencies for Kindergarten through 12th grade (SEAs and LEAs), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) funded schools, and institutions of higher education within a specific geographic region or nationwide based upon criteria developed by DoED. The system must be geo-coded, wireless, secure mobile system and capable of deployment to various alternate locations with built-in redundancy capabilities.  The system has to have the capability to send classified and unclassified information  (actual system classification up to the Top Secret level completed within the DoED).  In addition, the notification system has to be compatible and fully interoperable with the Department of Homeland Security operational systems.  The system shall have multiple levels of communication capabilities (i.e. phone lines (land and cellular), fax, emails, Blackberries, satellite, etc.) and should be scalable to reach select groups determined by the DoED.  The communication system must be reliable, wireless, portable, redundant, and user-friendly.  In addition, the DoED requires that the contact database is commercially available, operable and currently compiled of educational institutions to meet the requirements.  This is not a requirement to build a database. Based upon these requirements, Unisys would serve as the system integrator using a solution developed by the RESPOND Emergency Management Consortium (REMCON).  EMTEL, as Unisys' exclusive partner and subcontractor, will provide their proprietary and unique Emergency Notification System Contact Database (NSDB) SchoolCall911 that contains all the school contact information (telephone, fax, email, cellular, TTY/TDD) of all SEAS, LEAs, BIA-funded schools and institutions of higher education in the nation.  This unique proprietary database can be used to extract datasets for use by ED to create a relational database that can serve as ED's central repository for all school contact information.  Ezenia Inc, as a subcontractor, will provide their InfoWorkSpace (IWS) collaboration technology and real-time information sharing network.  EMTEL, under an OEM agreement with Ezenia, utilizes IWS, along with unique interfaces and features to create NetComm911 which is part of the SchoolCall911 product.  Anticipated contract award for the DoED emergency communication system is September, 2007.  The anticipated award is on a sole source basis and is in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request for proposals.  This is not a solicitation and no solicitation is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No award will be based upon any offer or proposal received in response to this notice.  Telephonic inquiries or responses will not be honored.

The General Services Administration, Office of Travel, Motor Vehicles and Card Services, Travel and Transportation Acquisition Support Division (QMAC) is posting a Request for Information (RFI) to determine venders? capabilities and interest in potentially providing the Federal Government with a Travel Manager Training and Certification Program.  QMAC is seeking information in the form of capability statements from all interested parties with the skills, knowledge, experience and capabilities necessary to meet the stated requirements.  

BACKGROUND

The government lacks a certified training and education program for travel professionals at federal agencies to gain the necessary knowledge and experience to deliver consistent best-in-class travel management practices for their agencies.  The goal of travel management excellence throughout the government is important, given the travel expenses incurred across the government and the investments made in upgrading shared services programs such as E-Gov Travel.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates the budget for object class 21 (travel and transportation of persons) as follows:

Object Classification (in millions of dollars)
Object Class 21	
Description Travel and transportation of persons	
2006 actual 20 
2007 est. 23  
2008 est. 24
 			
It is important to ensure that the senior travel professional at each government agency, who is charged with overseeing all components of the agencies travel management program, has the necessary skill sets to perform the functions expected of them.  Additionally, the other intended audience for this training is senior travel department professionals involved in travel policy, vendor management, risk management, overseeing their agency?s E-Gov Travel Service, travel finance and budgeting, as well as those responsible for authorizing travel. The overall intended audience throughout the government to which a Travel Manager Training and Certification Program would apply is undetermined but could initially be in the range of 100-200 students.  Having a trained workforce will result in best-in-class travel management practices and deliver the following outcomes:

?	Increased travel policy and compliance
?	Better utilization of negotiated rates
?	Leveraged spending
?	Stronger oversight of travel spending
?	Performance metrics for cost, satisfaction and effectiveness of operational model
?	Best value
?	Improved audit ability
?	Improved supplier management
?	Strategic use of human capital

REQUIRED SERVICES/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

The future procurement, if one should occur, will be for a professional travel manager training and development program, which would be offered to all federal agencies, which they in turn would be able to individually access in order to best meet their needs.  
Anticipated requirements and performance characteristics of the program would include, but are not limited to characteristics listed below. However, it is possible that industry has already established the optimum curriculum and standards for professional travel manager training and certification. The government is looking for industry?s current capability to the extent that there is an industry recognized Travel Manager Training and Certification Program available and the extent to which it would be applicable to the government.

The program should: 


?	Implement world-class commercial travel training processes;
?	Offer certification and non-certification professional travel management training opportunities;
?	Deliver content via web-based training and/or class room training;
?	Include content covering Fundamentals of Travel Management
?	Include content covering Financial Management 
?	Include content covering Change Management techniques;
?	Include content covering Business Process Re-engineering techniques;
?	Include content covering Program Evaluation techniques;
?	Include content covering  Risk Management Strategies;
?	Include content covering Performance Management techniques, including how to establish baselines for government performance to benchmark against commercial best practices;
?	Include content covering Federal travel management regulations and policies;
?	Include content covering optimizing use of a organization?s preferred suppliers;
?	Include content covering corporate travel management best practices;
?	Comply with common characteristics of best-in-class travel training including business drivers, supply chain, governance, and service provided; 
?	Include strategies and processes for increasing customer satisfaction by optimizing travel training and support processes. 

You are encouraged to comment on government specific content, if any, that you advise to complement core curriculum.

 Students successfully completing the entire program should be able to: 

?	Identify strategies for effectively implementing policy and programs across an enterprise;
?	Identify strategies for applying commercial best practices most effectively in their agencies? travel programs; 
?	Identify strategies for establishing performance measures for their agencies? travel programs and comparing those measures against other agencies? travel programs and commercial best practices;  

What other skills does your students master?

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNETIUM-99M SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY OFFERS LICENSE TO SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE RECOVERY OF MEDICAL ISOTOPE TECHNETIUM-99M PRODUCED BY AN ELECTRON ACCELERATOR.  Announcement:  Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners capable of developing, implementing, and commercializing BEA proprietary separation technologies for Tc-99m from low concentration Mo-99 created by the (??,n) reaction through bombardment of Mo-100 by photons from an electron accelerator, and who are interested in entering into a license agreement, research and development agreement, or both, for the purpose of developing and commercializing this technology.  License terms would include an up-front licensing payment, minimum annual royalties and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  A research and development agreement would be under a standard CRADA arrangement with an option for licensing subject inventions.     Note:     THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY BEA TO ENTER INTO EITHER A LICENSE AGREEMENT OR A COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITH ANY COMPANY.     A description of the technology follows:  Two methods of thermal separation of Tc-99m from accelerator generated Mo-99 were designed and tested for continuous production of the Tc-99m medical isotope.  They are described in U.S. Patents 5,802,438 and 5,802,439.  Briefly, the thermal separation facilitates the separation of Tc-99m from low specific concentration Mo-99 oxide.  Efficiencies for separation are very high compared to current separation technologies.  The first method involves melting the Molybdenum to a thin pool and then evaporating the Technetium to a collection point.  The second involves the creation of micro-crystals of molybdenum and sublimination from off the crystal faces, and the subsequent recycling of the crystals.  These patents teach two economical, recyclable, and reliable methods for producing the leading medical isotope in diagnostic imaging. The methods have advantages over the current supply method that costs may be lower, radioactive waste production is minimal, and new methods do not use uranium, either HEU or LEU.  INL studies suggest that a system of about 20 regional production facilities, based on this technology, located throughout the U.S. could supply the total U.S. demand for Technetium-99m at a per dose cost of less than half the current market price per dose.  More details will be available to qualified companies under a nondisclosure agreement.  The successful company will be expected to:  a) be capable of funding the development of the thermal separation technologies, b) have expertise in the development of medical isotope production and use, and c) have the ability to commercialize the product of these developmental activities.  
Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies interested in commercializing BEA??s thermal separation technologies should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following: 1) company name and address; 2) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address for a point of contact; 3) a brief description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology; and 4) a brief description of how the company might commercialize this technology.  The statement of interest should be made by US mail or e-mail and should be received within 30 days of publication of this opportunity at the following address: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Advisory Account Executive, Technology Transfer & Commercialization, BEA, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805. E-mail is John.Snyder@inl.gov.

<SUBJECT>F--Notice of Intent to Issues Single Source Award
<DESC>There is no solicitation.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, contracting and General Services Division in Portland, OR have a requirement for otolith microchemistry which is used to distinguish between resident and anadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss.  A primary goal of the Coleman National Fish Hatchery (aka Coleman NFH) is to produce steelhead to contribute to the sport fishery in the Sacramento River and delta.  However, anecdotal information indicates that a portion of O. mykiss produced at the Coleman NFH may not be displaying an anadromous life history.  To conduct otolith microchemistry requires highly sophisticated equipment and a high level of technical expertise.  Accurate interpretation of otolith microchemistry data requires familiarity with the specific species and watershed being evaluated in the study.  The University of California Santa Cruz (aka The Regents of the University) is the only known source that has both the equipment (e.g. electron microprobe and mass spectrometer) and the personnel with extensive experience using the equipment to assess life history patterns of O. mykiss from throughout the Central Valley of California, including the Coleman NFH.     The Service intends to award sole Source to The Regents of the University.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-2.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Hazard Deficiency
<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) is required by law and committed to providing a safe and healthful environment for its employees.  In order to accomplish this, Air Force Safety Offices worldwide conducts inspections, investigates mishaps, performs Job Safety Analysis (JSA), and acts upon employee complaints in order to identify hazards on an Air Force installation.  When hazards are identified they must be tracked until the hazardous condition is abated.  Currently, the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) does not have automated capability to track identified hazards, in a single common database nor maintain oversight of the Air Force Hazard Abatement Program.  The objective of the Hazard Deficiency Reporting Software is to provide safety offices the capability to enter and track hazards from identification to abatement in order to protect Air Force (AF) employees and preserve vital national resources in a common automated environment.  This module will also eliminate the need for annual reporting to higher headquarters, provide for analysis of common hazards AF-wide, and the capability to share common data information with other military branches.

<SUBJECT>54 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO MODIFY PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE RENTAL OF A TRIPLE WIDE MEDICAL TRAILER IN PASCAGOULA, MS
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL), located in Pascagoula, MS, intends to modify Purchase Order WC133F-05-SE-6858 for the rental of a triple wide medical trailer by adding two additional 12 month option periods which will extend the period of performance through December 31, 2011 with Resun Leasing Inc., Dulles VA based on the following reasons 1) The NSIL lab was demolished when hurricane Katrinia struck Pascagoula, MS in August of 2005.  NSIL acquired this trailer through competitive bid and has been utilizing this triple wide medical unit as Laboratory space while a new building is being constructed; 2) The existing Purchase Order was awarded from a competitive bid, but only allowed for occupation through December 31, 2007 and now the extension of the existing rental agreement is essential while a new building is being constructed; 3) NSIL has made a significant investment in the remodeling and preparation of the triple wide medical unit so that it could be utilized as laboratory space.  The current facility has been outfitted with all the necessary laboratory equipment and supplies and NSIL has been able to resume their mission.  The cost to vacate this building, move it off the property, procure a new facility, move it onto the property, outfit it, and hookup all the utilities would be far more costly to the Government then extending the lease through the addition of option periods; 4) The extension of the current lease would also eliminate the disruption of employees and the programs they are working; 5) This extension of this lease on the triple wide medical unit is critical to NSIL operations in Pascagoula, MS.

The Government plans to negotiate with Resun Leasing Inc. for the continued rental of the triple wide medical unit trailer currently in its possession and onsite in Pascagoula, MS.  Inquiries regarding this requirement should be directed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  The applicable NAICS code is 332311.

(xi) OBJECTIVES: The configuration we are requesting is patterned after the current configuration we use for an 80 mm TSE for production of PBW diet but we plan on having an adaptable TSE for use for other insect diets.   Currently the extruded diet we produce consists of the following ingredients: agar, sugar, soy flour, wheat germ, yeast and water. Moisture content is about 60% of the weight of the finished product. Four liquid ingredients are dispensed into the extruder: water, corn oil, acetic acid and vitamin solution dissolved in water.  Current production rate using the 80 mm TSE is 695 kg/hr operating at 325 rpm/hr and has residence time of 55 seconds.  (xii) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  The Twin Screw Extruder and its components must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable:  The extruder must be new equipment, used equipment is not acceptable. The equipment shall have at least a one year warranty.  It shall have  34-40 mm barrel diameter with a length to diameter ratio of 35:1.  The barrels shall be lined with hardened nitrided steel.  The barrels may be closed barrel type or clam-shell design. The machine must have an electrical heating system with a heating element in each zone of the barrel  capable of achieving heating temperatures of 170 degrees Celsius. The machine must be capable of cooking and extruding diets consisting of the following mixture: agar, sugar, soy flour, wheat germ, yeast, water, corn oil, acetic acid and vitamin solution dissolved in water. It shall have a programmable logic control (PLC) operating system. The PLC system may be a stand alone or integrated unit.  Due to room configuration and space limitations,  if the PLC is an integrated unit, it shall be located on the right hand side of the front of the machine (the end opposite from the discharge). It must have internal cooling system ports capable of accepting a mixture of water and glycol up to 50% glycol.  The main drive motor must have electrical specifications of 480V, 3 phase, 60Hz, with the power produced sized appropriately to the extruder diameter and in the range of 50-80 HP at the machine's top RPM rating. The main drive motor must also be capable of operating the TSE in the desired range of RPM for our extrusion process of 200-850 RPM.  The machine requires ports for liquid injectors or thermocouples to measure product temperature in each machine zone.  Zone 1 (one)  is required to have two separate ports.  The die head at each discharge of each screw end must consist of a one (1) inch diameter female national pipe thread standard (NPT).  The die head is to be fitted with a port to measure barrel pressure and a pressure transducer shall be provided to monitor die head pressure, this will be capable of integration to the PLC.  Thermocouples will be provided for temperature control or for monitoring product temperature shall be provided for each zone of the barrel, these shall be capable for integration to the PLC. The machine must include a complete set of screws meeting the requirement of having a total set length of 35 diameter for each shaft along with spares (10%) to cover breakage and to ensure there are replacement parts so as not to hamper production.  The final screw set configuration will be determined in consultation between USDA and the contractor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17.   The purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation is to acquire an independent study of railroads to respond to a GAO report and to implement GAOs recommendation.  The STB intends to retain a contractor that will provide a team of qualified analysts to assess competition in the U.S. railroad industry. The Government will be available to provide, upon request, technical assistance to the Contractor, but the Contractor will be expected to fully staff and manage the project.  A Fixed Price contract is contemplated for this requirement.  SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECS/WORK STATEMENT - Report to the U.S. STB on Competition and Related Issues in the U.S. Freight Railroad Industry  	C.1.0 Introduction - In October 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its latest report on the U.S. railroad industry.  GAO found that the industry health has improved, but it expressed concerns over competition and captivity in the railroad industry. GAO recommended that the Surface Transportation Board (STB or Board) conduct a rigorous analysis of the state of competition in the U.S. railroad industry and consider actions to address problems associated with potential abuses of market power. 

In this statement of work the STB seeks to implement GAOs recommendation. The study will focus on competition in the railroad industry and will review and analyze various proposals that might enhance competition.  As part of the analysis, the study will explore the interaction between capacity and competition in the railroad industry. The study also will examine the railroad industrys privately owned capital infrastructure expenditures relative to its overall earnings and how such expenditures compare with such outlays in other capital intensive industries.  NOTE:  The Contractor is to compare the capital requirements of the railroad industry with other industries.  Collection of this information should be considered background information needed to put the railroad industry structure, conduct, and performance into a proper perspective. 

The STB is soliciting proposals for an independent and quality technical analysis from a team of highly skilled researchers. While STB staff will be available to provide technical assistance as specified herein, the STB and its staff will not otherwise be involved in conducting the study or in the formulation of the conclusions and/or recommendations of the report. The STB will make available its Carload Waybill Sample (a very rich data source which we have collected for more than 20 years). The Board also collects and will provide (as needed) detailed operating and financial statistics on the Class I carriers. More broadly, the contractor can rely on the expertise of STB staff for general background information and to assist the contractor to the best of their ability, provided that such assistance does not compromise the independence of the final report.

C.2.0 	Background
In the years following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the U.S. railroad industry vastly improved its productivity, profitability, and performance. Rail transportation rates, in both real and nominal terms, declined steadily while freight volumes steadily increased. In the last few years, however, capacity constraints have emerged in key corridors and rates have in some cases increased sharply. The Government believes that changes in railroad rates should reflect the operations of a competitive marketplace and not an abuse of market power. 

The STB believes that capacity and competition are inherently linked and is concerned that the railroads may not be capable of generating the capital resources to provide sufficient capacity to adequately serve the public based on widely available forecasts. This concern led us to initiate Ex Parte 671, Rail Capacity and Infrastructure Requirements. The record developed in that proceeding has strengthened our belief that there is a direct link between railroad capacity and service levels.  A goal of this study is to examine the relationship between known capacity requirements and the railroads ability to meet those needs.  

C.3.0 	Scope  
The STB intends to retain a contractor that will provide a team of qualified analysts to assess competition in the U.S. railroad industry. The Government will be available to provide, upon request, technical assistance to the Contractor, but the Contractor will be expected to fully staff and manage the project.

C.4.0 	Technical Requirements  
The Contracting Officer (CO) will issue the contract for the required report. The designated Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide technical assistance as needed.
The Contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.  In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality.  The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions.  The first major step to ensuring a self-correcting contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success. Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.  

C.4.1 Tasks
The Contractor shall perform the following:
4.1.1	Task 1 - Orientation and Kickoff Meeting  
The purpose of this task is to provide the Contractor team with an adequate knowledge and understanding of the study goals and the regulatory system administered by the Government. 
4.1.1.1. Kick-off Meeting - The project will be initiated with a one-day kick-off meeting to be held in Washington, DC at a location to be provided at time of award.   The Contractor project manager (PM) and necessary technical experts will attend this meeting.  The Government will assist the Contractor in identifying the key sources of data on the railroad industry and review the findings reported in the GAO study. The Government will provide the Contractor with an overview of the statutory obligations and, in particular, the Government need to balance the competing interests delineated in the National Railroad Transportation Policy (49 U.S.C. 10101).
The Contractor will provide an overview of its company Quality Control Program for this type of work.
4.1.2 	Task 2 - Qualitative Research 
The purpose of this task is to conduct in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with shippers, railroad managers, academic experts, consultants, financial analysts, and key Government staff.  In particular, attention is to be focused on the importance of competition, capacity, and regulatory policy as drivers of the industry's performance.  In conducting these interviews, the Contractor shall include in its inquiries topics not limited to:  (1)  competition in the U.S. railroad industry both nationally and in selected geographic markets to be identified; (2) competition for grain, coal, chemical, general merchandise (boxcar) and intermodal movements; and (3) the effects of competition and capacity availability on service quality.  NOTE: Geographic markets have not been selected.  The Government will work with the vendor to identify representative markets for analysis. 

4.1.3	Task 3 - Develop a Methodology to Verify Results Obtained in Task 2
 Armed with the results obtained from Task 2, the Contractor will develop an appropriate analytical methodology to verify the results of its qualitative research.  This methodology must employ techniques from industrial organization and econometrics best suited to verifying the information obtained in Task 2.  The Contractor will report the details of its proposed methodological approach to the STB prior to proceeding with the verification process. The Contractor should highlight how the proposed approach is similar to or different from previous studies of competition in the U.S. railroad industry. The Contractor will explain why the methodological approach it has chosen will provide new insight into the state of railroad competition. Before the Contractor commences work on Tasks 4 and 5, the Government will provide appropriate technical comments on the methodological approach proposed by the Contractor.  
4.1.4	Task 4 - Analyze Competition in the Railroad Industry 
Incorporating the information obtained in Task 2, and relying on the methodology chosen in Task 3, the Contractor will collect and analyze the data needed to complete the competition assessment. Should the Contractor require specific information from the railroads that is not publicly available, the Government will assist the Contractor in collecting that data pursuant to its statutory authority at 49 U.S.C. 721 (b).   
4.1.5	Task 5 - Analyze Capacity and Service Quality in the Railroad Industry 
The Contractor will examine how competition and capacity constraints influence the quality of service provided by rail carriers.  
4.1.6	 Task 6 - Analyze Range of Policy Actions 
The Contractor will evaluate how the policy reforms suggested by GAO would affect the future financial health and stability of U.S. railroads and whether such proposals would stimulate or discourage private investments in the railroad industry. 
4.1.6	Task 7 - Prepare a Final Report 
The Contractor will prepare its final report by November 1, 2008. The contractor will be responsible for printing the report and producing an electronic/CD-Rom/disc production of the final report. The report shall be consistent with the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual, located on-line at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html.
C.4.2 Staffing
The value of the services to be provided to STB by the Contractor will depend heavily on the qualifications and experience of the Project Manager (PM) as well as the qualifications of the members of the PM team of experts. 
To avoid and preclude any appearance of a conflict of interest, the PM nor the Key Personnel (as defined at 4.2.2) will be subject to a conflicts screening.  The PM and Key Personnel must demonstrate that do not have an interest that would bias the results of the study.
4.2.1	Project Manager
The PM should possess the skills and experience needed to manage interdisciplinary teams of the type required for projects of this magnitude and complexity. The PM should also have substantial experience in the preparation of competition assessments. 
4.2.2	Key Personnel
Key personnel are considered essential to the successful performance of this contract.   The Contractor shall obtain and maintain current resumes of those identified for each position or function listed below that will be assigned for this project. Project Manager, Senior Qualitative/Marketing Researcher,	Senior Economist, Senior Econometrician/Statistician
The identified key personnel shall not be reassigned or removed without the written consent of the Contracting Officer unless the identified key personnel become unavailable.  At such time, the contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, within the first day of the unavailability and provide a written justification (including proposed substitutions) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impact on the performance and quality of the contract.  All proposed replacement personnel shall submit to the Contracting Officer a current resume to support that the replacement is comparable to the personnel being replaced.  The Government may amend the key personnel list.  
4.2.3	Other Personnel
The Contractor shall hire only competent personnel to be used in the performance of this contract. By competent, the STB means individuals with the skills, education, and experience needed to complete this report.
C.4.3	Travel with the $35,000 ceiling amount is envisioned to support Task 1 and Task 2.  It is not limited to those categories and could conceivably support the later tasks as well by approving travel requests that support the vendor's ability to complete the research and report.  It is expected that much of the qualitative research can be done in Washington, D.C., where many of the key stakeholders have a presence or can be expected to visit on a regular basis. It is also possible that portions of the qualitative research can be done through phone interviews, surveys, etc., which may also minimize travel time.  - END OF WORK STATEMENT

QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM (QCP) 
The Contractor shall establish and maintain a complete Quality Control Program to assure that the requirements of the contract are met as specified.

 The USCG Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) Portsmouth, VA has a requirement to purchase: a total of 130 each Beacon Signal Generator.

  1200-SMSK-PIVIAFE Digital Global Position System (DGPS) Beacon Signal Generator

The 1200~SMSK-PMAFE is the signal generation module of the MR-1O1 enhanced DGPS medium frequency data modulator.  This module accepts signals from a DSP card PMAFE interface and generates a Shaped MSK modulated data at user selectable data rates and carrier frequency.  The 1200-SMSK-PMAFE timing is based on either an internal or an external 10 MHz frequency reference that may be both time and frequency synchronized to an external One-PPS pulse from GPS. The l200-SMSK-PMAFE is designed to operate with a companion DSP card, for example, the Momentum Data Systems HAWK89 board, hosted on a PC PCI bus. This combination permits control of the modulation process and the generation of the desired data message.

To permit immediate testing of the 1200-SMSK-PMAFE, the cards are shipped with SMSK modulator test software. This Windows? based program generates a phase modulated carrier using standard RTCM SC 104 formatted 6-of-8 formatted messages or fixed internally generated test messages. 

1200-SMSK-PMAFE specifications when interfaced with the HA WK89 DSP card (MRD-101) and CEI control software

SCOPE OF WORK

INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this contract is the creation of educational materials regarding procedures to follow when seabirds are found that have been injured by fishing fear and regarding the location, purpose, and regulations pertaining to wildlife sanctuaries in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI).  Two educational pamphlets will be created, one for hooked seabirds and one for wildlife sanctuaries.  The pamphlets will be distributed to commercial and recreational fishers and tourists in USVI by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) and the Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR), Divisions of Fish and Wildlife and Environmental Enforcement.  This project is part of a 3-year effort to provide enforcement officers and other local agency partners with educational materials for outreach activities with the public and fishers and tourists in particular.   This contract will support local efforts to strengthen enforcement, increase public awareness, and reduce the impacts of overfishing, which are focal areas of the Coral Reef Task Force, and the USVI Local Action Strategy.  


BACKGROUND:
In order to minimize impacts to marine resources and to create consciousness regarding the importance of conserving these resources, NOAA Fisheries, in partnership with the DPNR, has conducted fishers workshops and outreach activities with enforcement officers, created a number of educational materials specific to USVI, and provided USVI enforcement officers with field guides and other reference materials for use during interventions with the public related to violations of fishing and marine resource conservation regulations.  The creation of additional educational materials will complement these multi-year efforts. 

The Division of Fish and Wildlife of DPNR is responsible for the management of the wildlife sanctuaries, as well as the protection of seabirds in cooperation with other federal agencies.  The Division worked with NOAA Fisheries on a previous project to create the ?U.S. Virgin Islands Recreational Fishing & Boating Information Pamphlet,? which contains a section on handling hooked seabirds and a section on offshore islands and cays with information about the designation of the 33 cays owned by the territorial government as wildlife sanctuaries.

NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Regional office, Sustainable Fisheries Division, published ?A Fisherman?s Guide to Hawaii?s Seabirds? with instructions on handling seabirds injured by fishing gear.  DPNR Division of Fish and Wildlife is interested in a similar pamphlet specific to USVI, which is part of this project.

This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries? efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to ?preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment.?

SCOPE:
Start date: Date of award 
End date: June 30, 2008 

In order to meet the objective of this contract the contractor shall complete the work in two distinct tasks: pre-production and production.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: Quantity of 1, PULSED NANOSECOND LABORATORY POWER SUPPLIES which must meet the following minimum specifications: Background: NASA is currently evaluating the use of weakly-ionized plasma devices for practical applications in Aeronautics and Space Exploration. In order for these plasma devices to become practical, efficient means of ionization are necessary. Specifically, non-thermal means of ionization must be developed. The generation of non-thermal atmospheric pressure discharges such as corona discharge and dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) provides the means of ionizing electrons in the gas while maintaining nearly constant ion/neutral molecule temperature. These non-thermal atmospheric pressure discharges are reported to offer efficiency in the generation of plasmas in air by very rapid localized heating of the flow due to high current filaments formed by the constriction of electric discharges occurring at high pressure. These streamers propagate from the anode to the cathode at speeds greater than 105 m/sec and have a radius of about 200 ìm. Up to 600 streamers per meter have been observed. At the primary streamer head, a thin layer of high energy electrons with average energies of 10-20 eV efficiently ionize and excite background molecules during their passage through the gas. The neutral gas temperature in the streamer stays close to the ambient gas temperature. Thermalization and breakdown are avoided through the application of short, high-voltage repetitive pulses. These discharges are already being studies for a variety of industrial applications such as pollution control and surface treatment processes and have been used for years to generate ozone for water purification. An efficient means of generating plasma in air could open the door to practical aerodynamic devices to modify the heat transfer and fluid dynamic characteristics of high speed flows over surfaces. Equipment Specifications: The principal objective is the development and demonstration of efficient ionization technology for creating large-scale plasma for practical aeronautical and space exploration applications. Specifications for this effort are set by reports of efficient coupling of electromagnetic energy into air with the use of pulsed nanosecond discharges. The power supply will be installed on a wind tunnel with an estimated 20-25% coupling of power into the flow. A multi-kW power supply will be needed for use as a plasma generator in the 1 ft X1 ft supersonic wind tunnel.  An Electrical Power Supply with the following specifications is desired: (1)	Output Voltage: A maximum output voltage of 40 kV into a 500-1000 Ohms load is required. A minimum of 4 output channels (2 positive and 2 negative with up to 10 kV per channel) is required. (2)	Input Power: 500 VDC 25 A (~10 kW) & AC 100-240 (sources provided by user) (3)	Pulse Characteristics: a.	Rise Time 3-4 nanoseconds b.	Fall Time 5-6 nanoseconds c.	Pulse Duration at 90% Vmax 18-20 nanoseconds d.	Maximum Pulse repetition rate (PRF) 100 kHz, PRF to be adjustable by user from single pulse to 100 kHz (4)	Triggering: Internal and external, external pulse 10 VDC, 100 nanoseconds duration (5)	Cooling: Forced air up to 10 kHz, forced air + water for PRF &gt; 10 kHz (6)	Electrical Cable and Connectors: To be furnished by vendor (7)	User and Operation Manuals: To be furnished by vendor (8)	Warranty: At least 12 months The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-18.

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [  ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

Final approval will be given only after full-scale production has begun.  2.1  MIXING PLANT:  Mixing plants shall meet the requirements of the applicable local State Highway Department specifications for Hot Mix Plants. 2.2  Bituminous-Materials Spreaders:  Bituminous-materials spreaders shall be the self-propelled type equipped with hoppers, tamping, or vibrating devices, distributing screws, adjustable screeds operated either manually or automatically, equipment for hea ting the screeds and equalizing devices.  The spreader shall be capable of spreading hot bituminous mixtures without leaving indented areas, tearing, shoving, or gouging and capable of producing a finished surface conforming to the smoothness requirements specified hereinafter and placing the course to the required thickness. If an automatic grade control device is used on the spreader for two-lane paving operations, it shall consist of sensing device for control of one end of the screed and a slope-control  mechanism for control of the other end of the screed, or a sensing device on each side of the paving machine.  Where the paver is used on multiple paving lanes (more than two paving lanes), sensing devices shall be used on each side of the spreader for co ntrol of the screed.  The slope-control mechanism shall not be used for grade control in multiple paving lane operations. 2.3  Steel-Wheel Rollers:  Steel-wheel rollers shall be self-propelled, three-wheel, (two-axle) and tandem (two-axle) types, weighing not less than 20,000 pounds each.  The three-wheel rollers shall have a minimum weight of 300 pounds per inch of width of rear wheel.  Wheels shall be equipped with adjustable scrapers, water tanks, and sprinkling apparatus for keeping the wheels wet; thereby preventing the bituminous mixture from sticking to the wheels.  Rollers shall be capable of reversing without backlash  and free from worn parts.  Roller wheels with flat and pitted areas or projections that leave marks in th e pavement will not be permitted.  Three-axle tandems will be permitted in lieu of two-axle tandems if approved by the Contracting Officer. 2.4 Heavy Pneumatic-Tired Rollers:  Heavy pneumatic-tired rollers shall be self-propelled and shall consist of two axles on which are mounted multiple pneumatic-tire wheels in such manner that the rear group of wheels will not follow in the tracks of the f orward group but spaced to give essentially uniform coverage with each pass.  Axles shall be mounted in a rigid frame provided with a loading platform or body suitable for ballast loading.  Tires shall be smooth and capable of being inflated to at least 90  p.s.i.  Construction of the roller shall be such that each wheel can be loaded to a minimum of 4,500 pounds.   2.5  Blowers and Brooms:  Blowers and brooms shall be power type and suitable for cleaning the surface to be paved. 3.0  EXECUTION: 3.1  WEATHER LIMITATIONS:  Bituminous courses shall be constructed only when the base course or intermediate course is dry and when the weather is not rainy.  3.2  PREPARATION OF SURFACE:   Bituminous mixtures shall not be placed with-out ample time to complete spreading and rolling during daylight hours, unless approved satisfactory artificial lighting is provided.  Immediately prior to placing the bituminous b ase or surface course, all loose material, dirt, clay, or other objectionable material shall be removed from the surface. An asphalt tack coat shall be applied to all existing asphalt concrete surfaces in advance of the asphalt concrete overlay placement.  The asphalt tack shall be placed at an asphalt residue coverage rate of 0.05 gal/sq yd. 3.3  TRANSPORTATION OF BITUMINOUS MIXTURE:  The bituminous mixture shall be transported from the mixing plant to the site in trucks having tight, clean, smooth beds coated with a minimum amount of a concentrated solution of hydrated lime and water to preve nt adhesion of the mixture to the truck beds.  Each load of mixture shall be covered with canvas, or other suitable material of ample size to protect the mixture from the weather and to prevent loss of heat.  Deliveries shall be scheduled so that spreading  and rolling of all mixture prepared for one day's run can be completed during daylight.  The mixture shall be delivered in such manner that the temperature at the time of dumping into the spreader will be not less than hereinafter specified.  Loads that h ave crusts of cold, unworkable material or have become wet by rain will be rejected.  Hauling over freshly placed material will not be permitted. 3.4 Installation: 3.4.1  PLACING:  Any layer of surface source shall not be left uncovered by the subsequent course for more than 5 days, weather permitting.  Material trucks hauling materials other than asphaltic concrete or tack coat shall not travel on previously constru cted layers of asphaltic concrete until the final surface course is constructed. 3.4.2  Joints:  3.4.2.1  General:  Longitudinal joints of the overlay shall be offset at least 1 foot from existing joints.  Transverse joints shall be offset at least 2 feet from existing transverse joints.  Joints between old and new pavements or between successive day' s work, or joints that have become cold because of delay, shall be tacked and shall be made carefully to insure continuous bond between old and new sections of the course.  All joints shall have the same texture, density, and smoothness as other sections o f the course.  The tack shall be overlapped onto the previous pavement 1 or 2 inches.  Contact surfaces of previously constructed pavements, curbs, gutters, manholes, etc., shall be tacked.  If these surfaces have become coated with dust, sand, or other ob jectionable material shall be cleaned by brushing or cut back with an approved power saw, as directed.  The surface against which new material is to be placed shall be sprayed with a thin, uniform tack coat.  The material shall be applied far enough in adv ance of placement of the fresh mixture to insure adequate curing.  Care shall be taken to prevent damage or contamination of the sprayed surface.   3.4.2.2  Transverse Joints:  The roller shall pass over the unprotected end of freshly placed mixture only when placing of the course is discontinued or when delivery of mixture is interrupted to the extent that unrolled material may become cold.  In all c ases, the edge of the previously placed course shall be cut back to expose an even, vertical surface the full thickness of the course.  In continuing placement of strip, the mechanical spreader shall be positioned on the transverse joint so that sufficient  hot mixture will be spread to obtain a joint after rolling which conforms to the required density and smoothness specified herein.  When required, the fresh mixture shall be raked against the joints, thoroughly tamped with hot tampers, smoothed with hot i rons and rolled. 3.4.2.3  Longitudinal Joints:  Longitudinal joints in surface course or intermediate course shall be offset as stated above.  Procedures outlined in specification paragraph:  Special Requirements for Placing Strips Succeeding Initial Strips shall be follow ed when making longitudinal joints.  Edges of previously placed strips that have cooled or are irregular, honeycombed, poorly compacted, damaged, or otherwise defective, and unsatisfactory sections of the joint shall be cut back to expose a clean, sound su rface for the full thickness of the course as directed.  When required, fresh mixtures shall be raked against the joint, thoroughly tamped with hot tampers, smoothed with hot irons and rolled.   3.5   General Requirements for Use of Mechanical Spreader:  The range of temperatures of the mixture, when dumped into the mechanical spreader shall be as determined by the Contractor.  Asphalt mixtures having temperatures less than 235 degrees F. when dum ped into a mechanical spreader will be rejected.  The mechanical spreader shall be so adjusted and its speed so regulated that the surface of the course being placed will be smooth and continuous without tears and pulling, and of such depth that, when comp acted, the surface will conform with the cross section, grade, and contour shown on the drawings.  Unless otherwise directed, placing shall begin along the centerline of areas paved on a crowned section or on the high side of areas with a one-way slope, an d shall be in the direction of the major traffic flow.  The mixture shall be placed in consecutive adjacent strips having a minimum width of 10 feet, except when edge lanes require strips less than 10 feet to complete an area.  Each strip placed before a s ucceeding strip shall be of such length that sufficient heat will be retained to make the strip readily compactable so that a joint can be obtained conforming to the requirements for texture, density, and smoothness specified in the paragraph:  JOINTS.  Th e length of any strip to be laid prior to the succeeding strip shall be as directed and may be decreased or increased as dictated by changes in climatic conditions.  Longitudinal joints and edges shall be constructed to true line markings.  The Contractor shall establish lines parallel to the centerline of the area to be paved and shall place string lines coinciding with established lines for the spreading machine to follow.  Number and location of lines shall be as directed.  Placing of the mixture shall b e as nearly continuous as possible, and the speed of placing shall be adjusted, as directed, to permit proper rolling. 3.6  Special Procedures to Prevent Segregation:  The wings of the spreader hopper shall not be emptied (flipped) between truckloads.  The screed auger shall be operated approximately three-fourths (3/4) full and the hopper conveyor shall not be allowed to run out of material. 3.7  Special Requirements for Placing Strips Succeeding Initial Strips:  In placing each succeeding strip after the initial strip has been spread and compacted as specified hereafter, the scre ed endgate of the mechanical spreader shall overlap the previously placed strip slightly and shall be 1.25 times thicker than the existing compacted strip in order to produce a smooth compacted joint with the specified density.  Mixture placed on the edge of the previously placed strip by the mechanical spreader shall be pushed back (tucked) to the edge of the strip being placed by use of a lute (rake).  The pushed back material shall form a ridge on the uncompacted strip along the edge of the previously pl aced strip.  The height of the ridge above the uncompacted strip should be approximately equal to the thickness being allowed for roll down during compaction.  Procedures similar to these outlined above shall be used to facilitate getting a smooth joint wi th density.  When the quantity of mixture on the previously placed strip plus uncompacted material in the strip being placed exceeds that required to produce a smooth, dense joint, the excess mixture shall be removed and wasted.  Excess material shall not be spread over the uncompacted mat. 3.8  Shoveling, Raking, and Tamping After Machine Spreading:  A sufficient number of experienced shovelers and rakers shall follow the spreading machine, adding hot mixture and raking the mixtures as required to produce a course that, when completed, will conform to all requirements specified herein.  Broadcasting or fanning of mixture over areas being compacted will not be permitted.  When segregation occurs in the mixture during placing, the spreading operation shall be suspended until the cause is determ ined and corrected.  Irregularities in alignment of the course left by the mechanical spreader shall be corrected by trimming directly behind the machine.  Immediately after trimming, the edges of the course shall be thoroughly compacted by tamping lateral ly with a lute.  Distortion of the course during tamping will not be permitted. 3.9  Hand Spreading in Lieu of Machine Spreading:  In areas where the use of machine spreading is impractical, the mixture shall be spread uniformly with hot shovels and hot rakes in a loose layer of a thickness that, when compacted, will conform to the re quired grade and thickness.  During hand spreading, each shovelful of mixture shall be carefully placed by turning the shovel over in a manner that will prevent segregation.  In no case shall the mixture be placed by throwing or broadcasting from a shovel.   The loads shall not be dumped faster than can be properly handled by the shovelers and rakers.   3.10  COMPACTION OF MIXTURE:  Compaction of the mixture shall be accomplished by the steel-wheel rollers and pneumatic-tired rollers specified above.  Rolling shall begin as soon after placing as mixture will bear roller without undue displacement.  Delays  in rolling freshly spread mixture will not be permitted.  After initial rolling, preliminary tests of crown, grade, and smoothness shall be made by the Contractor under supervision of the Contracting Officer.  Before rolling is continued, deficiencies sha ll be corrected so that finished course will conform to requirements for grade and smoothness specified herein.  Further smoothness checks shall be made by the Contractor as directed by the Contracting Officer.  After preliminary smoothness tests, rolling shall be continued until density is obtained in all portions of each course of not less than 95 percent of density of laboratory compacted Marshall specimens taken behind the paver. 3.11  Density Tests:  Density of the compacted mixture of the surface course shall be determined by tests made on specimens tested in accordance with the requirements of ASTM D 2726. 3.12  Operation of Rollers, Tampers and Vibro Plate Compactors: The speed of rollers shall be slow enough at all times to avoid displacement of the hot mixture.  Displacement of the mixture resulting from reversing the direction of the roller or from any o ther cause shall be corrected at once by use of rakes, and fresh mixture shall be appli ed or removed when necessary.  Alternate passes of the roller shall be varied slightly in length.  During rolling, the wheels of steel-wheel rollers and plates of vibro plate compactors shall be moistened to prevent adhesion of the mixture to the wheels or  plates, but excess water will not be permitted.  Tires of heavy pneumatic roller shall be moistened with soapy water when required to prevent mixture from sticking to tires during rolling.  Rollers shall not be permitted to stand on finished courses until  the courses have thoroughly cooled.  The minimum number of rollers shall be adequate to obtain the specified density.  Places inaccessible to rollers shall be thoroughly compacted with hot hand-tampers or vibro plate compactors.  Unless otherwise directed  by Contracting Officer, a pneumatic-tired roller shall be used as an intermediate roller.  Longitudinal joints shall be pinched to ensure compaction with the pneumatic-tired roller.  The roller shall make at least one complete pass (forward and backward) operated on the hot lane as the intermediate roller.  The roller shall be operated with its outside tire as close as possible to the previously placed lane. 3.13  Correcting Deficient Areas:  Mixtures that become contaminated or are defective shall be removed.  Skin patching of an area that has been rolled will not be permitted.  Holes the full thickness of the course shall be cut so that the sides are perpend icular and parallel to the direction of traffic and the edges are vertical.  Edges shall be sprayed with tack coat.  Sufficient fresh paving mixture shall be placed in the holes so that finished surface will conform to the grade and smoothness requirements .  The paving mixture shall be compacted to the density specified herein. 3.14   EDGES OF PAVEMENT:  Edges of pavement adjacent to the shoulders shall be trimmed neatly to line.  Shoulder material not less than 1 foot wide shall be placed against and to the full height of the pavement surface as soon as practicable after final r olling has been completed and the pavement has sufficiently hardened. 3.15  PROTECTION OF PAVEMENT:  After final rolling of the pavement, no vehicular traffic of any kind shall be permitted until the pavement has cooled and hardened or for at least 6 hours. 3.16  SURFACE SMOOTHNESS:  After final rolling, the pavement surface shall not vary in excess of 1/8 inch from a 10-foot straightedge laid on the surface parallel with the centerline.  When a 10-foot straightedge is laid on the surface transverse to the ce nterline between the crown and the edge of the pavement, the surface shall not vary more than 1/4 inch from the straightedge. 4.  MEASUREMENT:  Bituminous mixture shall be weighed on standard truck scales.  Scales shall be approved by an inspector of the State Inspection Bureau charged with scale inspection within the State in which the project is located.  In lieu of weighing on  scales, the Contractor may submit copies of waybills or delivery tickets during the progress of the work.  The weighing shall be done after mixing on public or other scales which have been approved by the Contracting Officer and certified by the State whe re the scales are located.  . 5 COMPUTATION OF QUANTITIES:  Asphaltic concrete surface courses shall be computed in tons of mixture delivered to the project and placed.  The computations will be based on the waybills and delivery tickets submitted.  The accumulative totals will be roun ded off to the nearest 0.1 tons. 6. TRAFFIC CONTROL:  The Contractor shall furnish, maintain, relocate, and remove any necessary traffic control signs and barricades so as to control traffic during all construction operations in accordance with the latest edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (M.U.T.C.D.).  Signs shall be installed to safely control traffic.  Location of signs will be the Contractor's responsibility.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to incorporate a revised SOW, revised BOM, and provide questions and answers submitted against the RFQ.  Closing date remains Thursday 16 August 2007 at 2:00 pm EST.

Please contact Alice Jeffres at alice.jeffres@gsa.gov for the revised SOW and BOM.

Questions:

1.	Section 3.0 Quality Assurance Plan for Attachment 1 (McAfee IntruShield) The Government will assess contractor performance by 100% of contractor response.  Compliance with the performance standards is dependent more on the response of the manufacturer, McAfee, who is delivering the support, rather than the contractor.  How is acceptable performance standard defined (per incident, average over evaluated period, etc)?  How are penalties assessed for not meeting acceptable performance standards?

Response:  Unacceptable performance will be notated on contractors past performance assessment rating.  A consistent pattern of not meeting the standard time line could result in termination of contract.

2.	Section 4.0 Deliverables.  Besides billing information itself is there any other required information to be provided in the monthly billing report deliverable?

Response:  Section 4.0 Deliverables is hereby deleted.

3.	Section 6.0 Period of Performance.  Solicitation states that all maintenance invoices must be billed in arrears.   The manufacturer requires the contractor to pay for the full period (1 year) in advance.  Please consider permitting the contractor to invoice for the full period of performance in advance, instead of monthly in arrears.

Response:  The Government cannot pay for services in advance that they have not received.  Billing can be monthly or quarterly.

4.	Attachment 1.  Grant Number specified is inactive in the McAfee system.  Please provide current Grant Number.

Response:  The correct Grant Number is 1453555-NAI

*  The ?Total Vehicle Price? for each CLIN appearing in the price schedule shall be inclusive of all costs incurred in acquiring and delivering that CLIN to the designated testing laboratory two weeks prior to the designated test date.  CLIN prices shall be fixed, but certain components of those fixed prices are subject to economic price adjustments as follows:
?Acquisition services:  The administrative costs incurred in acquiring and delivering the vehicle to the designated laboratory.  This would include the cost for labor, overhead, G&A, and profit.  The Acquisition Service component shall be fixed at time of contract award and not be eligible for economic price adjustments.
?Storage costs:  The contractor may have to arrange for storage of a vehicle prior to that vehicle?s delivery at the testing facility (which must occur 2 weeks prior to the designated test.)  These potential storage costs shall be fixed at time of contract award and not be eligible for economic price adjustments.
?Vehicle sales price:  The vehicle sales price represents the price the contractor paid for the vehicle as well as all applicable tax and title costs.  The vehicle sales price is fixed at time of contract award, but may be subject to either upward, or downward economic price adjustments based upon market conditions existing at the time the vehicle is purchased.  In addition, the vehicle sales price may be effected by changes to vehicle specification requirements as may be identified by NHTSA.  If price adjustments are necessary, a modification to the contract will be executed in order to reflect the effect of those adjustments on the CLIN price. 
?Shipment and delivery costs:  The costs incurred by the contractor in transporting and delivering the vehicle to the designated testing facility.  These costs are fixed at time of contract award, but may be subject to either upward, or downward economic price adjustments based upon market conditions existing at the time the vehicle is purchased.  
III.  BACKGROUND
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is a mode within the US Department of Transportation and is tasked to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities occurring on the nation?s highways.  NHTSA?s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) provides national leadership in planning, developing and initiating new and innovative consumer information programs that are based upon laboratory or full-scale crash tests.  These programs generate market forces, which encourage the production of improved passenger motor vehicles and/or occupant protection systems.  The ultimate goals of NCAP are to (1) give consumers a measure of the relative safety potential of automobiles and (2) improve occupant safety by providing market incentives for vehicle manufacturers to voluntarily design their vehicles to better protect occupants in a crash and be less susceptible to rollover, rather than by regulatory directives.NCAP was initiated in 1978 with the primary purpose of providing consumers with a measure of the relative safety potential of vehicles in frontal crashes.  Side crash test results were added to the program beginning with model year 1997 vehicles. In 2007, one of the provisions of the recently enacted Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA?LU) requires new passenger vehicles to be labeled with safety rating information published by NCAP. In other words, NCAP safety information must appear on new vehicles as soon as possible, as part of the labels required by the Automobile Information Disclosure Act (known as the ?Monroney label? or price sticker). NHTSA is proposing that its ratings be placed on new vehicles within 30 days of notifying a vehicle manufacturer. Because of the requirement, NCAP is faced with the challenge of  testing more vehicles under a very tight time schedule. Meeting the challenge requires upgrading the current testing process, which includes NCAP vehicle purchasing procedures.  To this end, NHTSA requires that certain specified vehicles be provided to pre-identified laboratories to facilitate timely NCAP testing.  This process will assist the agency in meeting its scheduling requirements. 
IV.OBJECTIVE
The objective of this procurement is to award a single contract which ensures that those vehicles identified in the Price Schedule are provided to designated testing laboratories, within the prescribed timeframe, in order to meet the NCAP requirements.  
V.SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
Vehicle purchases must meet the specific requirements listed below:
1.Vehicles must meet the specifications, and any modifications made by NHTSA to those specifications, listed in the Price Schedule and awarded Delivery Orders.   If a conflict exists between the specifications listed in the Price Schedule and those listed in a Delivery Order, then the Delivery Order specifications shall take precedence.    Any deviations from those specifications must be requested in writing to the COTR and Contracting Officer and must receive the COTR?s written concurrence prior to vehicle purchase.  The contractor shall be subject to replacement costs for any vehicle that is delivered to the test laboratory that fails to meet the  specific requirements listed in the Price Schedule or Delivery Order.
2.Vehicles shall not have been driven more than 200 miles (as evidenced by the vehicle?s odometer) before delivery to a testing facility.
3.Vehicles shall have a full tank of gas upon delivery to the testing laboratory. 
4.The Vehicle Price (i.e. final negotiated price of the vehicle excluding tax and title) shall not exceed the manufacturer?s suggested retail price (MSRP).
5.Vehicle purchases shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures specified in the ?Contract Administration, Section VI? portion of this contract.
6.Title to vehicles must be free of any lien and must cite the following as the vehicle owner:  U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NVS-111, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington DC  20590.
CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
A.Placing Orders:  Contract Line Items (CLINs), listed in  the price schedule represent NHTSA?s current known NCAP requirements as of the contract award date.  These requirements may change depending upon consumer needs, market conditions, and safety trends; therefore, the contractor shall not purchase any vehicles until such time as a Delivery Order is executed by the NHTSA Contracting Officer per the following procedures:
1.NHTSA will develop a Delivery Order Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFP will identify which Contract Line Items (taken from the price schedule) the contractor must provide.  If additional safety equipment will be required, (See Section II.C above) the RFP will so state.  A Delivery Order RFP may include as little as one or as many as all the vehicles presented in the price schedule.
2.For each vehicle listed in the Delivery Order RFP,  the contractor shall:
?Seek at least three quotes.  If three quotes cannot be obtained, the contractor shall explain why.  These quotes will establish the ?Vehicle Sales Price? component of the ?Total Vehicle Price.?      
?Secure the most advantageous shipment and delivery terms for each vehicle.  The price associated with these terms shall establish the ?Shipment and Delivery? component of the ?Total Vehicle Price.?
?The contractor shall add the prices for the ?Acquisition Services? and ?Storage cost? components to arrive at a  ?Total Vehicle Price? for each quote received.  
3.The contractor shall then identify the winning bid as the one whose ?Total Vehicle Price? is lowest and whose terms and conditions comply with those of this contract and the  Delivery Order RFP.  
4.The contractor shall then transmit an electronic Delivery Order offer to the Contracting Officer which  includes all the vehicles listed in the Delivery Order RFP.  The offer shall include the dealers contacted (to include their contact information), quotes received from those dealers, the VIN of the vehicle selected, shipping and delivery cost, and the fixed Acquisition Services and storage costs.  The offer shall also include any additional information that may be needed (e.g. reason why fewer than 3 quotes were received.)
5.Upon acceptance of the offer, the NHTSA Contracting Officer will execute and provide a copy of the signed Delivery Order to the contractor.  The Contracting Officer?s execution of the delivery order shall serve as authorization for the contractor to fulfill the requirements of that Delivery Order.
6.Upon completion of all requirements of a specified Delivery Order (to include delivery of the vehicle to the prescribed testing laboratory), the contractor may then submit its invoice for that Delivery Order to the address listed in part VI.B of this contract.
7.The government reserves the right to add or delete CLINs, or change specifications, delivery schedules or delivery destinations  as they appear in the Price Schedule.  Any changes to the Price Schedule shall appear in the Delivery Order. 
8.Every Monday ? the contractor shall transmit, via e-mail, a report on the status of each Delivery Order.  The report shall include date of the vehicle purchase as well as shipping and delivery status until such time as the vehicle is delivered to, and accepted by the testing laboratory.
9.Every Friday ? the contractor shall transmit a file to the COTR that includes the following information and documentation for each vehicle purchased and delivered:  1) Invoice from dealer; 2) Manufacturer?s invoice;  3) MSO or title;  4) Odometer statement; 5) Copy of the report listed paragraph 8. above that applied to that vehicle.  The file shall be sent via FEDEX or other express mail service.  Due to increased security concerns, documents transmitted via USPS may be delayed and or damaged; therefore, USPS shall not be used. 
10.  Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from the date of contract award through twelve (12) months thereafter.
11.  If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered ?issued? when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule.
52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
1.  All or None:  Offerors must submit their proposals based upon the purchase of all CLINs listed in the Price Schedule.  Offers which do not propose to supply all CLINS will not be considered for award.
2.  Single Award:  The government intends to award only one contract resulting from this Request for Proposal.
3.  Contractor Capability:  The contractor shall describe its plans for:
A.  Receiving three competitive bids for each vehicle listed in the price schedule;
B.   Ensuring the purchased vehicle includes those requirements and components specified in the price schedule;
C.  Ensuring vehicles are shipped via the most cost-effective manner and are delivered to the specified test facilities within the timeframes specified.
4.Past Performance:  The offeror shall provide a history of its performance in fulfilling requirements such as the one defined in this Request for Proposal.  The offeror shall provide a list of previous customers who can attest to the quality of supplies/ services provided by the offeror.  This list shall include the customers? names, Point of contact to include phone number, date(s) on which the services or supplies were provided, and any other information which may assist the contractor in documenting the quality of customer service provided previously.
5.Price:  (a)  For each contract line item (CLIN) listed in Part II, Price Schedule, of this RFP, and using the Price Evaluation Forms provided at the end of this RFP, the contractor shall provide the applicable Acquisition Services price, Storage costs,  Vehicle sales price, and Shipment and delivery costs ( as defined in Part II.)  In developing vehicle sales prices, offerors shall include the ?Required Safety Equipment,? as listed in Section II.C. of this solicitation.  Prices shall not include safety equipment listed in Section II.D.  
All prices will be reviewed for price realism.  Unrealistic pricing, either too high or too low, may disqualify the offer from consideration for award.  Prices listed in the Price Evaluation Forms will be used as the basis for developing the Price Schedule (Section II.)  The government will use the ?Total Contract Price? as listed in the Price Evaluation as the basis for price comparison between offers.  
(b).  Contractor Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are as important as price when evaluating proposals.  
 (c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
PRICE  EVALUATION  FORMS
(Note:  Prices shall be based on Body, Type, Test Lab, Delivery date and required standard safety equipment presented in Part II of this RFP.)

CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION
Work under this contract requires that the Contractor be given access to confidential or proprietary business, technical, or financial information belonging to other private parties or the Government. Consistent with our statutory obligations under 49 USC 11904, the Contractor, upon gaining access to such information, will treat this information as confidential and agrees not to appropriate such information to its own use or to disclose such information to third parties unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer in writing. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to:  1) Information that, at the time of receipt by the Contractor, is in the public domain; 2) Information that, through no fault of the Contractor, becomes part of the public domain after the Contractor has received it; 3) Information that the Contractor can demonstrate was already in its possession and was, therefore, not acquired directly or indirectly from the Government; or 4) Information that that Contractor can demonstrate was received from a third party who did not require the Contractor to hold it in confidence.  The Contractor shall obtain from each of its employees a written agreement not to discuss, divulge, or disclose any confidential information or data to any person or entity except those persons within the Contractors organization who themselves have signed a similar written agreement and are directly involved in the performance of the contract. In addition, the Contractor must secure from the Contracting Officer approval of these confidentiality agreements.  The Contractor agrees, if requested by the Government, to sign similar agreements with each organization supplying information to the Contractor under this contract, and to supply a copy of such agreements to the Contracting Officer. Occasionally, and upon request from the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall supply the Government with reports itemizing information received as confidential or proprietary and setting forth the organization or organizations from which the Contractor received such information.
DUPLICATION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA
Duplication or disclosure of the data and other information provided by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) or to which the contractor will have access as a result of this contract is prohibited.  The contractor hereby agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all such data to which access may be gained throughout contract performance whether title thereto vests in the STB or otherwise.  The contractor hereby agrees not to disclose said data, any interpretations thereof, or data derivative there from, to unauthorized parties in contravention of these provisions without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer or the party in which title thereto is wholly vested.  This clause also applies to any subcontractors and/or consultants used by the contractor.

SITE VISIT MINUTES
FOR
F3G0AB7127A100
Projectors/Lamps

MEETING TOPIC: Mission requirements and security restrictions of providing a projector system with audio and visual presentations.

DATE: 2 AUG 2007

The purpose of this site visit was to gain knowledge of mission requirements and allow contractors to ask questions in order to supply the best value product to the 561st Joint Tactics Squadron. In addition, contractors were given the opportunity to obtain measurements of the conference room, existing electrical circuit breakers, doorways and upcoming demolition of a wall to increase the area of the room.

Lt Sean Blair and SrA Paul Sanders met contractors at the visitor?s center on Craig Road. A 15 passenger van was utilized to transport contractors to 5490 Pease Drive, Bldg 1114. 

Once at Bldg 1114, I signed contractors in and informed them of security requirements that restrict cell phones, PDA?s, etc to pass through the entryway to the compound. Major Santos then escorted us through the building to the appropriate room where the installation will take place. An infrastructure representative with a camera was present throughout the meeting.

Major Santos started the meeting by displaying a map of the building and the particular room we were in. This briefing room will be used to brief distinguished visitors, so quality is a determining factor for award.

Major Santos mentioned that the west wall of the room will be demolished expanding the room from 17? x 21? to 25? x 21?. A contractor asked when the renovation would take place. Major Santos & Lt Blair stated that they will take construction time into consideration in the performance of this project, and expect to receive quotations now so that the projector project can immediately begin as soon as the wall is down. The projection screen was to go on the wall behind the west wall with consideration of the circuit breaker box in the center of the wall. A suggestion was made to project the images on the east wall. Major Santos and the Infrastructor rep agreed and the installation location was changed to the east wall.

Major Santos explained that he wanted 2 projectors and 2 screens to have the ability to display an image of classified video and unclassified video meshed together or 2 classified videos displayed simultaneously in the standard briefing room. He also expressed his desire to play DVD?s, CD?s, etc. CPU?s must be 3? apart per regulations as stated by Maj Santos. The 2 projectors need not be separated by 3?.

Lt Blair raised a question of using wireless keyboards, mice, clickers, etc because of mission control security issues. Major Santos nor the Infrastructor rep knew. SrA Sanders agreed to contact the comm squadron and supply contractors and provide Major Santos an answer by COB 3 August 2007.

Further discussion of the matrix switcher led to the desire to plug in a laptop to a podium station. Also, the audio controls need to be separated in it?s own stand at least 3? from the podium. Stereo requires quality speakers. The podium as stated by Major Santos is to be a stationary object due to the wires hooking up the equipment at the podium. The option of having a small screen in the podium for the briefer to use was discussed; preferably recessed in the podium to prevent the briefer from having to look around the monitor to view the audience seated at the roundtable. Major Santos would like contractors to provide a screen for the podium and install it, but not supply the 2 CPU?s.

Major Santos consulted the Infrastructure rep and determined that no microphones are needed or requested for this project due to the small room size.

A contractor asked if the 561st wants 1 main picture or 2 pictures. Major Santos stated he would like the ability to switch between multiple videos by the operator at the podium as well as a station at the roundtable in the center of the room as an option.

Lt Blair asked if contractors are expected to buy computers or would the 561st be supplying the computers. Major Santos said that the 561st will supply computers.

A contractor asked if they were to provide power sources for the projectors and computers. Major Santos stated contractors would supply the power source.

Major Santos stated that he would like the screens fixed to the wall with the possibility of electrically controlled up and down. Contractors were requested to supply quotes in an optional CLIN for this by Lt Blair.

It was advised by a contractor that using florescent light will have a negative effect on the picture quality and suggested the 3 lights closest to the screens be placed on their own switch in order to turn them off while presenting video/picture displays. Major Santos said that the 561st would like a projector that is brighter than the one they currently use to be able to see images such as road maps. The size of the screens was agreed upon by Major Santos to be 60X80 for both screens. Current projector model is: Epson Powerlite 820.

Lt Blair asked Major Santos about manning in the building in evening hours and weekends. A contractor asked what the earliest time of the day would be for them to start work. The start time was decided by Major Santos to be no earlier than 0730. Contractors mentioned that installation of the entire projector project will be no more than one week.

Lt Blair asked contractors to specify what is involved in quarterly cleanings in their proposals. Major Santos stated that he would like the warranty for maintenance to include next business day repairs.

A contractor asked what the due date was for quotes. I stated that the 14th of August would remain unless all present had a need for more time, in which it would be open for discussion. No contractor verbalized a need for additional time and said that they only needed a couple of days  to submit a quote and the 14th was sufficient. Quotes remain due by 14 August 2007. Also, the means of supplying a quote was questioned. My response, backed by Lt Blair, was that electronic via e-mail was the best method, but I would accept postal mail or facsimilie.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Intelligence requires a supply of (6) six Smart Board 660i or equivalent and the necessary accessories for their office in Washington D.C. This should included, but is not limited too, the interactive whiteboards with front mount projector, VGA cables, USB cables, stereo cables, bulbs for the projector, installation of whiteboards with projector, and training on using the Smart Board 660i or equivalent. 

To be considered an equivalent to the Smart Board 660i the interactive whiteboard should have these specific features: a projector that can mount directly above the whiteboard; one location for projector and audio controls; ability to select projector sources, adjust projector settings, and access help screen from whiteboard; and have the ability to write over any source, including video. 

This is 100% small business set aside.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide additional and clarifying information regarding the pool cover for the Combat Diver Training Facility located in Key West, Florida.  The pool is "L" shaped.  The width of the pool at each narrow end is 51'.  The length of the pool at the longest portion is 131'.  The pool cover shall be manufactured in six sections.  Three of the sections shall be approximately 17' wide and 131' long.  The remaining three sections shall be 16.6' wide and 51' long.  Each section shall overlap the gunwales by 6".  Three of the sections require special cuts and modifications due to steps and ladders.  The intent of this cover is to protect from chemical absorption and to prevent heat loss during winter months and prevent heat from entering the pool during summner months.  Covers shall be rugged enough to handle severe sunlight exposure and heat during summer months and frequent 25 knot winds during winter months.  Covers are removed and replaced daily and must withstand this constant putting on and taking off.  Due to the unique nature of this requirement, it is extremely important that vendors see the pools and take measurements.  Drawings are available upon request and vendors are to request these from the contracting officer, Mrs. Sandra Aman, sandra.aman@us.army.mil.  Site visits may also be scheduled by contacting the contracting officer.  Site visit requests shall be forwarded not later than 16 Aug 07.  Quotes are due 27 Aug 07.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this requirement with the following clause addenda to paragraph (a).  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, technical, delivery and price considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (1) Technical, (2) Delivery, and (3) Price.  NOTE:  This is a change from the original announcement.  (1)  Technical:  Vendors are requested to provide drawings and narrative discussion that clearly outlines their solution to the problem, discussing the fabric to be used as well as any other factors they believe clearly conveys their solution to this problem.  (2)  Delivery:  Offers will be evaluated for best delivery schedule.  Delivery is defined as the capacity and affirmation to conform to, or exceed the required deliveyr date (RDD) of this solicitation.  Vendors shall provide their anticipated delivery date with their quote.  (3)  Price:  Prices shall be quoted FOB destination to Key West, FL.  Technical is somewhat more important than delivery and technical and delivery combined are signifanctly more important than price.  The Government may pay more for a better solution to the problem and for faster delivery; however, price is always a consideration and the Government will determine if the increased cost of the product is worth the greater technical capability and faster delivery.
