<DESC>The scope of the UXO Remediation, Phase 3 (Project Number WWCX 03-9998P3) requires the contractor to furnish materials, equipment, labor and personnel necessary to plan, design, manage and perform removal of potential Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC), including final disposal of all items in the following areas of concern (AOC):
<p>-	AOC-1 UXO area in canyon (5.25 acres west of the active Landfill). MEC have been identified in this area and removal must be completed by the end of August 2013.</p>
<p>-	 AOC-2 UXO area of ridgeline (18 acres on the ridgeline north of the Landfill) - assessment/removal of MEC to be completed by August 2014.</p>
<p>-	 AOC-3 Estimated UXO boundary (21 acres located beyond the ridgeline to the north) - assessment/removal of MEC to be completed by August 2014.</p>
<p>Once all MEC is gathered the contractor shall be responsible for the disposal of all explosive material. The process of gathering MEC and the final disposal shall not have any impact on O&amp;M, US Personal or Civilian. The work must be carried out in the summer months July through August where the risk of snow on the ground is minimal. All work shall be performed by UXO qualified personnel. <br />The UXO remediation project Phase 3 covers area A , AOC-1, AOC-2 and AOC-3, in all approximately 44.25 acres.</p>
<p>The range areas associated with Thule AB have been used for live munitions training in the past.</p>
<p>IAW Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards (DA PAM 385-64 May 2011) there are no safe procedures for moving, rendering safe or destroying UXO, but merely procedures considered less dangerous. Destruction-in-place (referred to as either blow-in-place or BIP) is the least dangerous; therefore, the preferred method for UXO destruction.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for determining the amount of work needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract specifications and drawings.  All quantities listed in the contract documents are estimates only. The awardee will be responsible for determining actual needs. The awardee will be responsible for obtaining the necessary shipping and use permits for explosives, etc. required to perform the work. The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The project magnitude is less than  $500,000. The performance period for this project shall be approximately 2 years from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). "Notice to Offerors: Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs." Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation. It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically sometime between APR and JUN 2013 with offers due 30 days thereafter. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) and FAR 6.302-4 International Agreement, to Danish and Greenlandic firms except when procurement from such sources is not feasible. No hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed. Offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (see www.ccr.gov). <br /> <br />Point of Contact: Jesper Nielsen, Contract Administrator, Phone +45 33 41 74 68, Fax +45 35 26 51 08, Email jesper.nielsen@det1.dk, or Robert Hanks, Contracting Officer, Phone +45 33 41 74 67, E-mail robert.hanks@det1.dk</p>

<DESC>The Colville National Forest requires stewardship services on the Three Rivers Ranger District, in Stevens County, Washington (located in the NE portion of Washington State). <br /><br />The resultant contract will be a Requirements stewardship contract utilizing the authority granted under Section 347 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY 1999, as Amended by Sec. 323 of P.L. 108-7, 2003. The intent of this contract is to manage a piece of Forest Service land from the planning stage through completion of all product removal and service work activities.

Each task order will be negotiated with the prime contractor using the contractor's detailed cost breakdown, market research from similar projects in the geographical area and by comparing the cost to the Contractor's unit prices from the base contract.</p>
<p>This solicitation will result in an arrangement of a single award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, (IDIQ) performance-based, requirements contract spanning ten (10) years from the date of contract award. Pricing of work on a ton or level-of-effort basis will be used for determining price reasonableness for award purposes.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for testing of materials such as carbon phenolic and graphite phenolic materials and carbon/carbon, ceramic, insulation, ceramic matrix composite, and advanced and polymer composite materials supporting propulsion and space transportation applications. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Southern Research Institute (SRI), Birmingham, Alabama, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	 1.	This effort involves the testing of materials and the generation of testing data that are used in human-rated propulsion systems, which is critical in the mitigation of risks associated with the operation of those systems.  Due to the nature of the effort required, SRI is the only known source with the capability to generate test results with demonstrated reliability (i.e., repeatability, accuracy, and resolution) at extreme and typically non-standard testing conditions such as high temperature testing up to 5000 degrees F.  SRI is the only known source that can provide the unique combination of data understanding (i.e., failure mechanisms, component and specimen processing, specimen testing conditions, specimen design, component operation conditions, and data history), reliability, and component design accuracy to enable the most efficient and effective operating system to meet NASAs goals, thus allowing for the safest system.  SRI uniquely provides an ability to obtain maximum data understanding, data reliability, and design accuracy, using a unique combination of properties, such as tensile, compression, flexure strengths, in-plane shear strength with 45 degree; tension, and in-plane shear strength with 45 degree; compression configurations for composites and monolithic ceramic materials at temperatures greater than 5000 degrees F.	Only SRI has demonstrated they can generate specific heat data, unrestrained electrical conductivity data, thermal expansion data, Rumanian in-plane shear data, saddle in-plane shear data, and torsional in-plane shear data, creep with a circumferential coupon data, interlaminar shear data, double notch shear data, and tensile creep data at temperatures greater than 4600 degrees F, as well as fatigue data at a frequency of greater than 500 Hz, load ratio of 0.1, and temperature of 1800 degrees F.	Only SRI has demonstrated they can generate biaxial tension-tension and compression-torsion testing data from -250 degrees F to 1500 degrees F, among other testing capabilities.  This unique combination of data understanding, reliability, and component design accuracy is necessary for NASA to produce and operate these human-rated propulsion systems with the most accurate hardware designs and design safety margin. 2.	SRI is the only known source with the capability to provide a test of elevated temperature permeability with the specimen under a tensile or compressive load.  Further, SRI is the only firm with analog test capability which has been used to develop unique data to develop and validate thermal models for RSRMV nozzle ablative liners. This unique data generated by SRI from room temperature to 5000 degrees F is the only data validated to model the RSRMV and 1st stage SLS nozzle ablative material.	All of the ablative nozzle data used for thermo-structural analytical models to support demonstration, qualification, flight and flight anomaly investigation has been generated by SRI.  The restrained thermal growth test developed by and available exclusively from SRI is also necessary in characterizing and modeling next generation nozzle materials for the RSRMV and 1st stage SLS. 3.	SRI is the only organization that has developed a material property database from room temperature to 5000 degrees F on the graphite throat used in the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Booster Separation Motor (BSM) and the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Launch Abort System (LAS) Jettison Motor (JM).  This database is used in the thermo-structural analysis used for BSM and JM.  SRI provided test and failure analysis on the prior BSM throat factor safety investigation and will generate the database for the new graphite material currently being qualified for the BSM built by ATK Thiokol and the JM built by Aerojet.  Use of the BSM is expected to continue for the SLS / MPCV system and continued access to SRI expertise is necessary. 4.	SRI is the only organization that has developed a material property database for the cryogenic foam previously used on the Shuttle External Tank and currently anticipated to be utilized on the SLS Core Stage.  This data provides both understanding of the characteristics governing the foam loss (and resultant shuttle orbiter tile damage) and supports the only thermo-structural analysis model of the cryogenic foam known to exist. This unique expertise and understanding of this critical material system is available in no other organization and is essential in support of MSFC efforts to develop a similar but more sustainable foam thermal protection system for SLS. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to charles.a.holt@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. CST on April 4, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	  .

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) Lease No. GS-08P-13474 (LCO13474) located at 12155 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado provides 97,000 useable square feet of contiguous office and related space and 25 parking spaces for Government vehicles. Approximately 408 onsite parking spaces are available for tenant and client use.
<p>The Government now seeks to lease a minimum of 97,000 to a maximum of 101,850 useable square feet, plus 14 reserved surface parking spaces for Government vehicles and approximately 375 to 425 surface parking spaces available for tenant and client use. Additional requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>&#61607; Space must be offered in one building with a minimum of 25,000 usable square feet floor plate. Space may be located on the ground floor or above. Floors must be contiguous and have the potential for an efficient layout. Interior column spacing must be a minimum of 30 feet on center. <br />&#61607; At least two means of access to the site/building must be available. The site/building must have at least one boundary on an adjacent street.<br />&#61607; Building must have a minimum of three elevators, one of which must accommodate movement of office fixtures and furniture.<br />&#61607; Building must have a loading dock/garage door for delivery of large supplies and furniture.<br />&#61607; Roof of the building must have a direct line-of-sight to the microwave site located on the Squaw Mountain peak at coordinates LAT - N39o 40.73'; Long - W105o 29.56'.<br />&#61607; Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is necessary.<br />&#61607; Space shall have a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet from floor to finished ceiling. Approximately 5,600 square feet will used to accommodate the supply warehouse and conference center.</p>
<p>Space must be located in Lakewood, Colorado and within these boundaries: North-West 20th Avenue; South-Hwy 85 (Hampden), East-South Wadsworth Blvd. and West-Colorado State Route 470 intersection with I-70 on the northwest. Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.

<p>A lease term of 10 years firm term is sought. Space must be ready for occupancy by November 5, 2014.</p>
<p>GSA will consider alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government. In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space. Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.</p>
<p>Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership. If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM Local Mountain Time, April 5, 2013. Expressions of interest can be accepted by mail, e-mail or fax. Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.</p>
<p>A written statement of interest should be submitted by April 5, 2013 to: Dan McPherson, c/o General Services Administration, Colorado Service Center (8PSC), P. O.

Background - In October 1996, Congress enacted the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-262.  Eligibility Reform transformed the VA health care system from an episodic, inpatient care provider into a comprehensive health care provider and expanded eligibility for health care to all Veterans.  To manage resources, the law required VA to implement a priority based enrollment system and to annually assess the resources required to provide care to enrolled Veterans.  In 1998, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) partnered with an actuarial consulting firm to develop the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to project Veteran demand for VA health care.
The development of the EHCPM requires an extensive collaborative effort between VA and its actuarial consultant.  The actuarial consultant provides actuarial and analytical expertise and access to leading experts on health care trends, management efficiencies, and the broader health care environment.  ADUSH/PP leads EHCPM development and enhancements, collaborates with VA program offices and outside organizations to support the EHCPM, and communicates with stakeholders on the EHCPM methodology and projections.  VA program offices, field staff, and research staff provide expertise on the Veteran enrollee population, VA programs and initiatives, and the VA health care system.  
The EHCPM is an actuarial model for projecting Veteran enrollment and demand for VA health care for 20 years into the future. The projections and supporting analyses are central in the development of the VA medical care budget, strategic, capital, and workforce planning, and policy analysis.  VA is dependent on the EHCPM projections to support the development of approximately 92 percent of the VA medical care budget.  The ADUSH/PP and its actuarial consultants use the EHCPM to provide insight on Veteran demand for VA health care to VA, the Office of Management and Budget, Congress, the Government Accountability Office, Congressional Budget Office, Veteran Service Organizations, and other stakeholders.  
For each of the 20 projection years, the EHCPM projects the number of Veterans expected to be enrolled in a geographic area, their total health care needs, and the portion of that care they are expected to receive in VA versus from other health care providers.  The expenditure projections that support the VA health care budget request are based on the anticipated costs associated with the projected utilization of services (not projected numbers of patients).  A key function of the EHCPM is the ability to modify the underlying assumptions in order to produce projections results for multiple scenarios assuming any of the underlying assumptions change over the 20-year projection period.
The EHCPM currently projects utilization for 81 health care service categories, including long-term care services.  Generally, the services VA provides that are comparable to services provided in the private sector are modeled using private sector-based utilization benchmarks.  Services that are unique to VA (e.g., blind rehabilitation) or services where VA's practice pattern differs significantly from the private sector (e.g., prosthetics) are modeled using VA experienced-based utilization benchmarks.
The EHCPM accounts for the impact of the following attributes when projecting Veteran enrollment and use of VA health care services:
"	Enrollee age, gender, morbidity, and geographic migration patterns
"	Enrollee reliance on VA health care versus other health care providers
"	Enrollee income, local unemployment rates, and travel distance to VA facilities
"	Enrollee transition between enrollment priorities, e.g., movement into service connected priorities and transitions due to changes in income
"	Unique utilization patterns of various population cohorts, such as females, new enrollees, specific age cohorts, and veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND).  
"	New policies, regulations, and legislation and changes in the broader environment, such as the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit
"	VA health care initiatives, such as the mental health capacity improvement initiative
"	A continually evolving VA health care system, e.g., quality and efficiency initiatives
"	Future changes in health care practice and technology.
The EHCPM has evolved into a very complex health actuarial model to account for all of the known drivers of Veteran demand for VA health care.  Projections are developed at a very detailed level-by 13 enrollment priorities (1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, c, 8a, b, c, d), two genders, and 14 five-year age bands.  Geographically, projections are developed for sectors, which consist of one or more counties.  In addition, projections are developed separately for enrollees who used VA prior to Eligibility Reform, for OEF/OIF/OND veterans, and for female Veterans.  
The EHCPM is developed using VA actual enrollment, utilization, unit cost, and expenditure data, private sector health care utilization data, nationally recognized actuarial data sets, VA/Medicare enrollee level data match, and quantitative market survey data (e.g., VHA's Survey of Veteran Enrollees).  The EHCPM is supported by in-depth analyses of Veteran enrollment rates, enrollee mortality, morbidity, geographic migration, transition among enrollment priorities, reliance on VA versus other health care providers, and assessments of the impacts of drive time, unemployment rates, and income on demand for VA health care.  As an example of the complexity of the EHCPM, over 150,000 reliance factors that vary by demographic and geographic detail are used in each of the 20 projection years, and these factors vary by projection year.  In addition, stakeholders require that the EHCPM separately quantify the impact of the key drivers of demand for VA health care on enrollment, utilization, and expenditures.  Therefore, the factors that drive VA health care demand must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately. 
The VA health care system and the broader environment are continually changing, and the enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections must reflect the impact of these changes.  This requires that the ADUSH/PP and its actuarial consultants work closely with VA program offices, field staff, and researchers to incorporate their vision for the future delivery of health care services (Patient Aligned Care Team or PACT), the impact of health care initiatives (mental health), the impact of changes in VA's infrastructure, and assess and incorporate the impact of proposed policies (cost sharing), legislation, and regulations (Affordable Care Act), and external events (economic recession) on the VA health care system. 
A key challenge in modeling for the Veteran enrollee population is that enrollees have many other options for health care coverage (private insurance, TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.).  As a result, most enrollees only receive a portion of the total health care they need through the VA health care system.  For example, enrollees only choose to receive approximately 20 percent of all of the inpatient care they need from VA.  As a result, VA's internal data sources cannot be exclusively used to project total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.  VA must understand enrollees' total health care needs because many internal and external factors can change enrollees' reliance on VA health care.  For services VA provides that are comparable to the private sector, the EHCPM currently utilizes the incumbent's health care benchmarks as a basis to project enrollees' total health care demand.  
Description of Work - To support efforts to understand and project Veteran demand for VA health care, VA requires a health care actuarial consulting firm as prime vendor to provide actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services.  This will be a five-year contract with a base year plus four option periods.
VA requires a wide range of health care actuarial expertise and experience in areas such as morbidity-risk scoring, population and health status assessments, dual or triple eligible populations, U.S. health care trends, health policy analysis, and actuarial modeling capabilities dynamic enough to project utilization for strategic planning at the medical facility-level and at a more global level for budget formulation.  Historically, VA has required a significant volume of consulting hours to meet the needs of stakeholders; however, the volume of hours required is not consistent throughout the year.
A high-level description of the requirements follows.  These tasks will require extensive collaboration with VA and its stakeholders.  This collaboration will be lead by the ADUSH/PP staff.  
"	   Actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services to assess the impact of an evolving VA health care system and broader environment on Veteran demand for VA health care. 
Tasks are generally defined and accomplished with internal or external workgroups led by ADUSH/PP staff.  VA and VHA staff that have clinical and programmatic expertise in the task area provide insight into the VA health care system, data, policies, and programmatic guidance. The Contractor will provide the necessary volume of staff with the appropriate technical and analytical expertise to serve on and assist the workgroup.  Together, the workgroup will assess the potential impact on VA and develop assumptions for input into the EHCPM.  A significant volume of the tasks completed each year and the staff mix required are not known in advance.  
"	   Maintain, enhance, and annually update the EHCPM with new data from the most recently completed fiscal year (base year) and other newly available data, update supporting analyses, integrate new or updated assumptions and enhanced methodology, and produce Veteran, enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections for multiple scenarios assuming any or all of the underlying assumptions change over the 20-year projection period.  
The annual EHCPM update process begins in June and ends the following April.  The enhancements required are developed collaboratively with stakeholders during the update process.  The specifics and the number of EHCPM projection scenarios that VA will require are not known in advance.
The EHCPM consists of four main component projection models.  The methodology, supporting analyses, and assumptions for the 2012 EHCPM are documented in the 2012 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model Documentation and Analysis Report, September 2012.  
"	Veteran and enrollment projection model
"	Utilization projection model based on private sector utilization benchmarks
"	Utilization projection model based on VA experience based utilization benchmarks
"	Unit cost projection model  
The EHCPM has evolved over the past twelve years into a complex model designed to meet stakeholders' needs.  The Contractor will assume responsibility for maintaining and updating EHCPM as currently structured.  The EHCPM will continue to evolve from its current state to meet stakeholders' needs, and the Contractor will be a key partner with VA in defining how the EHCPM evolves to meet those needs. VA will provide the necessary data, documentation of the methodology and assumptions, and the SAS code that constitutes the EHCPM in its current state.
Contractors will need to propose a comparable methodology or benchmarks for the utilization projection model based on private sector utilization benchmarks.  This methodology must meet the objective of projecting Veteran enrollees' total demand for health care services and the portion of that demand that enrollees will receive in VA for services modeled using this model at the level of detail identified in the 2012 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model Documentation and Analysis Report, September 2012.  In addition, the factors that drive utilization of VA health care services must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately.
Responses to this notice shall be e-mailed or faxed to Clifford Snipe, Contract Specialist, FAX 540 479-8450; e-mail address: clifford.snipe@va.gov.   Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received in writing no later than 3:00 p.m. EST February 4, 2013. Responses should clearly state their ability to provide actuarial consulting services and maintain the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from their response to this announcement.

<DESC>The Planetary Science Division (PSD) within the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters seeks to understand how to better realize a scientific return on spacecraft system technology investments. This Request for Information (RFI), will provide PSD with recommendations on how to effectively infuse new spacecraft systems technologies that it develops into future competed missions, enabling increased scientific discoveries, lower mission cost, or both. We are collecting input on how to maximize the return on and benefits from current technology investments and thereby improve the prospects of the inclusion of these investments within future competed missions opportunities. We are requesting from the science and mission communities input on specific questions, their assessment of barriers to technology infusion as related to infusion approach, technology readiness, information and documentation products, communication, integration considerations, interaction with technology development areas, costs capped mission areas, risk considerations, system level impacts and implementation, and mission pull. Other volunteered input not supporting one of these areas from responders will also be considered. To this end, the PSD has formed a team comprised of Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program and In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) Program staff to execute this study. This team will engage the science and mission communities and seek inputs from industry, universities, and other organizations. This team also may seek opinions and analysis from consultants and contractors as needed to achieve the objective of this study. The most recent PSD Announcements of Opportunities (AOs) have offered the availability of the following technologies to the proposers:  The Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), aerocapture and aeroshell hardware technologies, the NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) ion propulsion system, and the Advanced Materials Bi-propellant Rocket (AMBR) engine.  Specific input on the use of these technologies are also being requested. Following the collection of the data from this RFI, with agreement from the responder, NASA may request one-on-one visits either virtually or face-to-face with the responders. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NASA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. Technology Infusion Study Process: This study will consist of five phases briefly noted below: Data collection Phase: NASA is utilizing the RFI vehicle to collect a broad range of input from members of the science and mission communities. This input is requested through the questions contained in the attached appendices: 	Appendix A provides the General List of Questions to be addressed by respondents regarding technology infusion barriers. It is requested that all respondents address these questions. 	Appendix B provides the list of questions for the In-Space Technology Program 	Appendix C provides the list of questions for the Radioisotope Power Systems Program.  o	Appendix B and C can be addressed as determined appropriate by the respondents.  	Appendix D is for reference regarding current targeted technologies and both programs. The Assessment team will be contacting respondents, as appropriate, for additional detailed discussions during the Discussion Phase. NASA also intends to directly contact and work with known proposers from the Discovery 12 AO. Analysis Phase: During this phase, the study team will generate common themes across the input received and identify any unique responses. The results of this phase will be shared with the PSD stakeholders prior to any contact with the outside community.  The contact plan for follow-on discussions with responders, where considered necessary or requested, will be formulated based on the outcome of the activities in this phase. Discussion Phase: During this phase, individual contact will be made with select RFI responders. There will be specific follow-up questions, but these discussions will be structured to have a dialogue and better understand the community and allow for further understanding of the written response. This phase will also allow for the technology specific questions to be discussed in greater detail. Recommendation Phase: This phase will document all information received and will abstract the information into recommendations to PSD management that will identify opportunities to improve technology development planning and technology infusion opportunities for future AOs.  Post Main Study Phase: In this phase, the study team will share the common themes and results of this study with the broad science and mission community. It is envisioned that this will occur at appropriate planetary assessment group meetings and conferences and will cover the study results and seek feedback.  RFI Response Details RFI responses must include: 	Name of the primary point of contact for the response and business title 	Institution or organization affiliation 	Postal address, E-mail address, and phone number 	Identification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response 	Indication if the responder is willing to be contacted upon NASAs determination of need for further discussion 	Indication if the responder requests to be contacted.  NASA will make every effort to contact those that indicate the request to be contacted. 	Responses to questions listed in Appendix A at a minimum, and Appendices B and C, as desired. Response Submission Requirements: 	The response time has been set for 30 days.  	Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than 11:59 PM Eastern Time, on April 19, 2013. RFI submissions will be accepted as E-mail attachments only. All responses must be sent to carl.e.sandifer@nasa.gov, with PSD Technology Infusion RFI Response from in the subject line.

An E-mail confirmation of receipt from NASA will be sent within a one-week period to the designated point of contact. Additional Details: 	Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in any possible later action, the initiators of this request make no commitment to include any particular recommendations. 	Please DO NOT include any proposal specific information in the response to the RFI, unless the description of some mission parameters are necessary to provide the necessary context for a response. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is used solely for information planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.

This is an invitation for potential suppliers to register their interest in providing air transportation and supporting services.

<p>The Postal Service is seeking to work together to create innovative and viable solutions with our potential suppliers. It should also be noted that although a supplier may or may not fully meet the estimated volume and/or requirements, subcontractors or airline partners are permitted to perform parts of the contract requirements with proper notification to the Contracting Officer as authorized, while working with the primary suppliers. The schedule for operations could be a passenger, freighter, or smaller aircraft operators as available, and how you can best meet the needs of Postal Service. Your information and responses to this RFI will be kept confidential. The Postal Service will analyze and review all possible solutions submitted in response to this RFI for information and planning purposes.</p>

Background - In October 1996, Congress enacted the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-262.  Eligibility Reform transformed the VA health care system from an episodic, inpatient care provider into a comprehensive health care provider and expanded eligibility for health care to all Veterans.  To manage resources, the law required VA to implement a priority based enrollment system and to annually assess the resources required to provide care to enrolled Veterans.  In 1998, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) partnered with an actuarial consulting firm to develop the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to project Veteran demand for VA health care.
The development of the EHCPM requires an extensive collaborative effort between VA and its actuarial consultant.  The actuarial consultant provides actuarial and analytical expertise and access to leading experts on health care trends, management efficiencies, and the broader health care environment.  ADUSH/PP leads EHCPM development and enhancements, collaborates with VA program offices and outside organizations to support the EHCPM, and communicates with stakeholders on the EHCPM methodology and projections.  VA program offices, field staff, and research staff provide expertise on the Veteran enrollee population, VA programs and initiatives, and the VA health care system.  
The EHCPM is an actuarial model for projecting Veteran enrollment and demand for VA health care for 20 years into the future. The projections and supporting analyses are central in the development of the VA medical care budget, strategic, capital, and workforce planning, and policy analysis.  VA is dependent on the EHCPM projections to support the development of approximately 92 percent of the VA medical care budget.  The ADUSH/PP and its actuarial consultants use the EHCPM to provide insight on Veteran demand for VA health care to VA, the Office of Management and Budget, Congress, the Government Accountability Office, Congressional Budget Office, Veteran Service Organizations, and other stakeholders.  
For each of the 20 projection years, the EHCPM projects the number of Veterans expected to be enrolled in a geographic area, their total health care needs, and the portion of that care they are expected to receive in VA versus from other health care providers.  The expenditure projections that support the VA health care budget request are based on the anticipated costs associated with the projected utilization of services (not projected numbers of patients).  A key function of the EHCPM is the ability to modify the underlying assumptions in order to produce projections results for multiple scenarios assuming any of the underlying assumptions change over the 20-year projection period.
The EHCPM currently projects utilization for 81 health care service categories, including long-term care services.  Generally, the services VA provides that are comparable to services provided in the private sector are modeled using private sector-based utilization benchmarks.  Services that are unique to VA (e.g., blind rehabilitation) or services where VA's practice pattern differs significantly from the private sector (e.g., prosthetics) are modeled using VA experienced-based utilization benchmarks.
The EHCPM accounts for the impact of the following attributes when projecting Veteran enrollment and use of VA health care services:
"	Enrollee age, gender, morbidity, and geographic migration patterns
"	Enrollee reliance on VA health care versus other health care providers
"	Enrollee income, local unemployment rates, and travel distance to VA facilities
"	Enrollee transition between enrollment priorities, e.g., movement into service connected priorities and transitions due to changes in income
"	Unique utilization patterns of various population cohorts, such as females, new enrollees, specific age cohorts, and veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND).  
"	New policies, regulations, and legislation and changes in the broader environment, such as the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit
"	VA health care initiatives, such as the mental health capacity improvement initiative
"	A continually evolving VA health care system, e.g., quality and efficiency initiatives
"	Future changes in health care practice and technology.
The EHCPM has evolved into a very complex health actuarial model to account for all of the known drivers of Veteran demand for VA health care.  Projections are developed at a very detailed level-by 13 enrollment priorities (1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, c, 8a, b, c, d), two genders, and 14 five-year age bands.  Geographically, projections are developed for sectors, which consist of one or more counties.  In addition, projections are developed separately for enrollees who used VA prior to Eligibility Reform, for OEF/OIF/OND veterans, and for female Veterans.  
The EHCPM is developed using VA actual enrollment, utilization, unit cost, and expenditure data, private sector health care utilization data, nationally recognized actuarial data sets, VA/Medicare enrollee level data match, and quantitative market survey data (e.g., VHA's Survey of Veteran Enrollees).  The EHCPM is supported by in-depth analyses of Veteran enrollment rates, enrollee mortality, morbidity, geographic migration, transition among enrollment priorities, reliance on VA versus other health care providers, and assessments of the impacts of drive time, unemployment rates, and income on demand for VA health care.  As an example of the complexity of the EHCPM, over 150,000 reliance factors that vary by demographic and geographic detail are used in each of the 20 projection years, and these factors vary by projection year.  In addition, stakeholders require that the EHCPM separately quantify the impact of the key drivers of demand for VA health care on enrollment, utilization, and expenditures.  Therefore, the factors that drive VA health care demand must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately. 
The VA health care system and the broader environment are continually changing, and the enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections must reflect the impact of these changes.  This requires that the ADUSH/PP and its actuarial consultants work closely with VA program offices, field staff, and researchers to incorporate their vision for the future delivery of health care services (Patient Aligned Care Team or PACT), the impact of health care initiatives (mental health), the impact of changes in VA's infrastructure, and assess and incorporate the impact of proposed policies (cost sharing), legislation, and regulations (Affordable Care Act), and external events (economic recession) on the VA health care system. 
A key challenge in modeling for the Veteran enrollee population is that enrollees have many other options for health care coverage (private insurance, TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.).  As a result, most enrollees only receive a portion of the total health care they need through the VA health care system.  For example, enrollees only choose to receive approximately 20 percent of all of the inpatient care they need from VA.  As a result, VA's internal data sources cannot be exclusively used to project total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.  VA must understand enrollees' total health care needs because many internal and external factors can change enrollees' reliance on VA health care.  For services VA provides that are comparable to the private sector, the EHCPM currently utilizes the incumbent's health care benchmarks as a basis to project enrollees' total health care demand.  
Description of Work - To support efforts to understand and project Veteran demand for VA health care, VA requires a health care actuarial consulting firm as prime vendor to provide actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services.  This will be a five-year contract with a base year plus four option periods.
VA requires a wide range of health care actuarial expertise and experience in areas such as morbidity-risk scoring, population and health status assessments, dual or triple eligible populations, U.S. health care trends, health policy analysis, and actuarial modeling capabilities dynamic enough to project utilization for strategic planning at the medical facility-level and at a more global level for budget formulation.  Historically, VA has required a significant volume of consulting hours to meet the needs of stakeholders; however, the volume of hours required is not consistent throughout the year.
A high-level description of the requirements follows.  These tasks will require extensive collaboration with VA and its stakeholders.  This collaboration will be lead by the ADUSH/PP staff.  
"	   Actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services to assess the impact of an evolving VA health care system and broader environment on Veteran demand for VA health care. 
Tasks are generally defined and accomplished with internal or external workgroups led by ADUSH/PP staff.  VA and VHA staff that have clinical and programmatic expertise in the task area provide insight into the VA health care system, data, policies, and programmatic guidance. The Contractor will provide the necessary volume of staff with the appropriate technical and analytical expertise to serve on and assist the workgroup.  Together, the workgroup will assess the potential impact on VA and develop assumptions for input into the EHCPM.  A significant volume of the tasks completed each year and the staff mix required are not known in advance.  
"	   Maintain, enhance, and annually update the EHCPM with new data from the most recently completed fiscal year (base year) and other newly available data, update supporting analyses, integrate new or updated assumptions and enhanced methodology, and produce Veteran, enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections for multiple scenarios assuming any or all of the underlying assumptions change over the 20-year projection period.  
The annual EHCPM update process begins in June and ends the following April.  The enhancements required are developed collaboratively with stakeholders during the update process.  The specifics and the number of EHCPM projection scenarios that VA will require are not known in advance.
The EHCPM consists of four main component projection models.  The methodology, supporting analyses, and assumptions for the 2012 EHCPM are documented in the 2012 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model Documentation and Analysis Report, September 2012.  
"	Veteran and enrollment projection model
"	Utilization projection model based on private sector utilization benchmarks
"	Utilization projection model based on VA experience based utilization benchmarks
"	Unit cost projection model  
The EHCPM has evolved over the past twelve years into a complex model designed to meet stakeholders' needs.  The Contractor will assume responsibility for maintaining and updating EHCPM as currently structured.  The EHCPM will continue to evolve from its current state to meet stakeholders' needs, and the Contractor will be a key partner with VA in defining how the EHCPM evolves to meet those needs. VA will provide the necessary data, documentation of the methodology and assumptions, and the SAS code that constitutes the EHCPM in its current state.
Contractors will need to propose a comparable methodology or benchmarks for the utilization projection model based on private sector utilization benchmarks.  This methodology must meet the objective of projecting Veteran enrollees' total demand for health care services and the portion of that demand that enrollees will receive in VA for services modeled using this model at the level of detail identified in the 2012 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model Documentation and Analysis Report, September 2012.  In addition, the factors that drive utilization of VA health care services must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately.
Responses to this notice shall be e-mailed or faxed to Clifford Snipe, Contract Specialist, FAX 540 479-8450; e-mail address: clifford.snipe@va.gov.   Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received in writing no later than 3:00 p.m. EST March 26, 2013. Responses should clearly state their ability to provide actuarial consulting services and maintain the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from their response to this announcement.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sam Houston Contracting Office on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM) intends to negotiate and award a logical follow-on contract in the interest of economy and efficiency to an original order placed against the Information Technology Enterprise Solutions - 2 (ITES-2) contract under CHESS for Base Operation Support (BOS) Requirements Model (BRM). This program supports analyses, assessments, and resource decision-making within the Army's Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System (PPBES). This serves a primary function in the overall programming, policy development, and management of Army installation resources at Headquarters, Department of the Army.   <br>  <br> This order will be issued to CACI-ISS, INC Newbrook Drive, Chantilly VA 20151-2218, to procure services in support OASCIM's Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System. The objective end state and vision for the BOS BRM project  will be for the continuing sustainment, and enhancement of BRM Web requirements generator application; support and enhancement of the base support integrated database; support Standard Service Costing requirements generation; and support ISR-S. As new policies and procedures that effect base support and PPBES evolve, BRM and associated applications shall be modified to incorporate these changes. This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price Task Order with a period of performance of approximately 6 months beginning 14 April 2013. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541512 with a size standard of $25.5M.  <br> CACI has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently performed under task order W91QUZ-06-D-0002-1V01.  No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. For the reasons noted above MICC - FSH intends to award a short-term logical follow-on task order to CACI to ensure that the OACSIM is able to meet its mission without any lapse in services while the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition is completed. No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the OACSIM's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. All questions and/or responses must be directed to Kimberly Miller at  Kimberly.miller19@us.army.mil. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Please note a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award. <br>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and 6.302-1(a)(2), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source contract under FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." FEMA intends to award this contract to Cassidian Communications, Franklin, TN, 37067. The contract is for one-year maintenance and support to existing hardware/software that was designed and manufactured by Cassidian Communications. The existing software is proprietary and patented and only Cassidian possesses the corporate knowledge required to support the existing system.
<p>No other firm can provide the maintenance support on the Communicator NXT! System, since it is a proprietary system. Installing and uploading another product from another contractor will void the warranty with Cassidian Communications and possibly create interoperability issues.</p>
<p>In addition, FEMA Directive 262-3 dated 11-03-11 designates the ENS system as the official FEMA solution for emergency notification. No other notification systems have been authorized for FEMA use. This system is provided by Cassidian via the Communicator NXT!</p>
<p><br />See initial JOFOC (attachment) for Section 508 and security requirements.</p>
<p>The total value of this requirement is anticipated to be approximately ____ and the expected period of performance is to be one year.</p>
<p>FEMA is aware of no other firm, other than Cassidian Communications that can provide the type of services and software maintenance described here and in the JOFOC. However, any firm that believes it is capable of providing equivalent services that meet the specifications stated and is an ENS that is authorized by FEMA shall e-mail a Statement of Specifications and associated product literature to Christine Todd at Christine.todd@dhs.gov.</p>

<SOLNBR>SAQMMA
<RESPDATE>040513
<CONTACT>Patrick T. Dermidoff, Contract Officer, Phone 703-875-4679, Email dermidoffpt@state.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to negotiate a sole source contract to Souktel under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1(Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements). The Government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It is the Government's belief that only Souktel can complete this project.<br /><br />
<p>The proposed contract action is for support to design and implement a SMS-based jobs matching campaign and to facilitate direct SMS engagement with users, through the provision of a user database, a computer interface that enables SMS messaging, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) services, and related technical assistance. The U.S. Department of State lacks sufficient resources and know-how to design and execute an SMS-based jobs matching campaign.  As a result, the U.S. Department of State is also unable to independently develop a user database fitting the target profile, by which it can message.  Furthermore, while the U.S. Department of State can develop the specific SMS content for its own messaging, it does not currently possess in-house expertise or capability to deploy these messages from its Washington offices.  And the U.S. Department of State is not, without contract support, situated to integrate a range of critical, enabling functions, such as the creation of IVR menus and audio libraries accessible to mobile users. <br /> <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511 with a corresponding size standard of $25.5 Million.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. There is no solicitation document. No RFP will be made available for competitive proposals.  Phone calls will not be accepted. The main point of contact for this requirement is Patrick Dermidoff (Contracting Officer) at dermidoffpt@state.gov.  Please reference "Souktel" in the subject line of any email. Interested parties may express their interest and will be allowed to provide a capabilities statement no later than Thursday, April 5, 2013 at 11:00 AM EST. If no viable responses are received, the U.S. Department of State will negotiate solely with Souktel.</p>
<p>A determination not to compete this proposed contract upon responses to this notice rests solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities.</p>
<p>The final FY13 SOF Experimentation focus area will be conducted on 4-13 Jun 2013 with the theme being Signature Reduction at Camp Roberts, CA.</p>
<p>Beginning in FY14, SOF technical experimentation event focus areas and locations are as follows:</p>
<p>October 2013 - Preservation of the Family and Force, location TBD</p>
<p>February or March 2014 - Maritime Mobility/Counter Mobility, location TBD</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 75 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts TNT experimentation events at Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Avon Park, Fl, and in cooperation with NPS at Camp Roberts, CA. These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. The event facilitates SOCOM personnel to identify potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions brought to the event should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted 4-13 Jun 2013 at Camp Roberts, CA and will explore emerging technology solutions and revolutionary improvements in SOF dismounted soldier or platform signature management. Any technology-based experiment conducted at the event will need to be capable of supporting a SOF unit to provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF operations. Any and all solutions must include the necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. Signature management technologies should address a combination of the following spectra:</p>
<p>&bull; Visible<br />&bull; Near Infrared (NIR)<br />&bull; Short-wave Infrared (SWIR)<br />&bull; Thermal (Mid-wave Infrared [MWIR] / Long-wave Infrared Infrared [LWIR])<br />&bull; Radar<br />&bull; Acoustic<br />&bull; Radio frequency (RF)<br />&bull; Multispectral</p>
<p>Experiment participants may bring their own electro-optical/infrared sensors to facilitate user evaluations of their technology. However, the Government anticipates bringing sensors as well. If the technolody to be tested requires a specific landscape, please note this in the online experiment nomination submission form. Camp Roberts has a wide range of foliage and terrain, and areas should exist to conduct each experiment properly. Night operations will be accommodated if needed for proper evaluation of a participant's technology, but this must also be noted in the online submission form. Note that a New Moon will occur at Camp Roberts on 8 June 2013 and moon rise will occur between 0214 and 0920 over the duration of this TNT event.</p>
<p>3. Security Requirements: Experiment participants should submit technical information associated with their technology experimentation nominations via CD/DVD only. Please see Paragraph C. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS below for futher information. All classified and/or proprietary information must be appropriately marked, labeled and secured.</p>
<p>4. All respondents shall prepare a Composite Risk Management (CRM) Worksheet (Department of the Army [DA] Form 7566, attached [Lotus Forms Viewer required]) in accordance with MIL-STD-882E and DA Field Manual 5-19. The risk assessment shall address the likelihood and severity of any inherent risks as well as risk mitigation measures required. The risk assessment shall be submitted as an attachment to the experiment nomination. Nominations submitted without a thorough and complete CRM will not be considered for participation. Reference the attached safety worksheet for assistance preparing the CRM. Also, respondents wishing to conduct experiments of a kinetic or energetic nature are responsible for ammunition and/or explosives shipments to include an Interim Hazard Classification (IHC) or Final Hazard Classification (FHC) and coordination for receipt and storage at Camp Roberts, CA.</p>
<p>If your experiment will be radiating on a given frequency or frequency band, you must have prior approval to transmit on that frequency. Prior approval may include compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Title 47, Part 15 or a Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the FCC. If equipment is government-owned and operating within a Federal Band, you must have National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) frequency approval. Your authority to radiate should be submitted along with your nomination or emailed directly to tech_exp@socom.mil. The FCC recommends you submit you request at least 30 days prior to the start of the event.</p>
<p>5. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATIONS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATION SUBMITTALS FOR THIS RFI MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN THE CLOSING DATE OF 4/19/2013. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for FY13 TNT events.</p>

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.216-9067 - ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT (LIQUID PROPANE GAS) (JAN 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Warranties. The Contractor warrants that -<br />(1) The unit prices set forth in the schedule do not include allowances for any portion of the contingency covered by this clause; and<br />(2) The prices to be invoiced hereunder shall be computed in accordance with the provision of this clause.<br />(b) Definitions. As used throughout this clause-<br />(1) The term "base price" means- <br />(i) The unit price offered for an item and included in the contract award schedule at time of award<br />(2) Market price means a price determined by an independent trade association, governmental body, or other third party and reported or made available in a consistent manner in a publication, electronic data base, or other form. This price may be either a single market price or a combination of market prices for price adjustment for individual items by product, market area, and publication as specified in paragraph (f) below. <br />(3) The term "base market price" means the preselected market price for an item as published on [Weekly Butane News Letter] in the publication specified in paragraph (f).<br />(4) The adjusting market price means the average price listed in the publication specified in paragraph (f) immediately preceding the date of adjustment. <br />(c) Adjustments. The Contracting Officer shall issue a modification to the contract to reflect any price change pursuant to this clause. The Contract price shall be adjusted at the initial date of performance only if the change between the market price at the start of performance and the base market price equals 5% (positive or negative) or more of the contract price. Price changes thereafter shall be no more frequent than every two weeks. Therefore, after the initial date of performance, the difference between the current market price and the base market price will be determined on a weekly basis, providing there has not been a price adjustment in the prior week (in which case no adjustment would be applicable). The Contract price will be changed by this difference, (positive or negative), at any time the adjustment from the current price to the newly adjusted price (positive or negative) is determined to equal 5% or more of the base price. Price changes will be formally issued in a contract modification which will be effective on the fourth business day immediately following the date of the publication used for the adjusting market price. For example, if the adjusting market price was published on a Monday, the effective date of the price change would be the Friday of that same week. <br />(1) Calculations. The prices payable under this clause shall be determined by adjusting the award price by the same number of cents, or fraction thereof that the market price increases or decreases, per like unit of measure, no more than every two weeks, providing that such an adjustment would result in a 5% or more change between the base price and the adjusted contract price. All arithmetical calculations, including the final adjusted unit price shall be rounded to the nearest thousandth of a cent. For example, if performance started January 1, the contract award price is $2.00 and if the base market price on the base reference date is 150.000 cents, and the adjusting market price immediately preceding the performance period is 160.000 cents, the contract price shall increase by 10.000 cents $2.10 at the start of the performance period. If the adjusting market price was 155.000 cents instead of 160.000, there would be no adjustment, since the difference between the adjusting market price and the base market price is less than 5% of the base price. All calculations in this example are purely hypothetical, and not based on any actual dates or prices. <br />(2) Revision of published market price indicator. In the event--<br />(i) Any applicable market price is discontinued or its method of derivation is altered substantially; or <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer determines that the market price indicator consistently and substantially failed to reflect market conditions,-the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate and comparable substitute for determining the price adjustments hereunder. The contract shall be modified to reflect such substitute effective on the date the indicator was discontinued, altered, or began to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions. If the parties fail to agree on an appropriate substitute, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(3) Failure to deliver. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this clause, no upward adjustment shall apply to product scheduled under the contract to be delivered before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the Default clause of this contract, in which case the Contract shall be amended to make an equitable extension of the delivery schedule.<br />(4) Upward ceiling on economic price adjustment. The Contractor agrees that the total increase in any Contract unit price pursuant to these economic price adjustment provisions shall not exceed [10] percent of the award price in any applicable program year (whether a single year or a multiyear program), except as provided hereafter. This [10] percent is not cumulative for each program year, and instead is applied to the price in effect at the beginning of each program year, through the end of that program year.<br />(i) If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that within the near future a price adjustment under the provisions of this clause will be required that will exceed the current contract ceiling price for any item, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the expected increase. The notification shall include a revised ceiling the Contractor believes is sufficient to permit completion of remaining contract performance, along with appropriate explanation and documentation as required by the Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) If an actual increase in the market price would raise a contract unit price for an item above the current ceiling, the Contractor shall have no obligation under this contract to fill pending or future orders for such item, as of the effective date of the increase, unless the Contracting Officer issues a contract modification to raise the ceiling. If the contract ceiling will not be raised, the Contracting Officer shall so promptly notify the Contractor in writing.<br />(d) Examination of records. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or designated representatives shall have the right to examine the Contractor's books, records, documents, or other data the Contracting Officer deems necessary to verify Contractor adherence to the provisions of this clause.<br />(e) Final invoice. The Contractor shall include a statement on the final invoice that the amounts invoiced hereunder have applied all decreases required by this clause.<br />(f) Publication, product, and location. The average of the high and low in Butane Propane News' (BPN's) Weekly Propane Newsletter, Propane Prices Update, Spot Prices for Natural Gas Liquids, at Mont Belvieu (not LDH) shall be used to calculate each four week average specified above. These prices measure the general rate and direction of price movement for this commodity within a market. This does not indicate a mandatory source of supply or area where bidders must obtain supplies. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />&nbsp;</p>

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?
    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>

The TEP will be determined based on the prices proposed for all the antennas in a particular class. The Government will award to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s), in response to the solicitation, provides the Government the lowest evaluated price, and meets the acceptability standards on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><br />Factor 1 -Price: <br /><br />The price proposal will be evaluated for completeness to ensure pricing has been submitted for all items in a particular class of antenna (Platform, Deployable, or Lightweight).

The Government will determine a Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for each Schedule proposed class of antenna based upon known Government requirements for the five-year ordering period. The TEP will be calculated per antenna class by multiplying the Government provided "TEP Evaluated QTY" by the Offeror's proposed antenna price. The sum of all calculated prices for each CLIN will determine the TEP per antenna class.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Technical: <br /><br />Each Technical sub-factor will receive a rating of acceptable or unacceptable. If any sub-factor is rated -"unacceptable," the entire proposal will be rated technically unacceptable, and the proposal will be excluded from award consideration. <br /><br />Sub-factor 1: Technical Capability -Technical Capability -The Government will rate the Offeror's technical capability as "acceptable" if the Offeror provides documented evidence of meeting all the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Work and Antenna Performance Characteristics (per class of antennas). <br /><br />Sub-factor 2: Delivery Schedule -The Government will evaluate the Offeror's delivery schedule proposed for each CLIN. The Government will rate the Offeror's delivery schedule as "acceptable" if at least the first 25 antennas of each CLIN proposed will be delivered within 90 days ARO. <br /><br />4.

<DESC><p>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to invite interested roofing contractors to a Pre-Proposal Conference in conjunction with the anticipated release of the draft Request For Proposal (dRFP).</p>
<p>The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is transforming the way the U.S. Air Force purchases its roofing repair and replacement needs. The ESG will move the Air Force to a regional contract model representing approximately $325 million in total roofing requirements over five years. This will represent a significant change in roofing acquisition for both the Air Force and roofing contractors. <br /><br />As part of an ongoing effort to more efficiently procure roofing for the Air Force, the ESG is preparing to solicit a targeted number of multiple award, regional indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contracts covering Air Force bases located in the contiguous U.S. This approach is a transformational shift from traditional base-specific contracts to a more strategic approach designed to address ongoing budget and manpower challenges.</p>
<p>In conjunction with anticipated release of the draft Request for Proposal, the ESG will be hosting a Pre-Proposal Conference to communicate the preliminary contract requirements that will be contained in the dRFP and to obtain input from interested roofing contractors. The Conference will be offered both in-person as well as broadcast over the Internet for those unable to travel. There will be no conference fee to participate. Proposed discussion topics for the event include:<br /><br />&bull; Overview of Strategic Sourcing<br />&bull; Role of Small Business and Teaming Arrangements<br />&bull; Overview of the Air Force Roofing Strategy &amp; Objectives<br />&bull; Review of the draft RFP</p>
<p>Interested contractors are invited to participate in this Conference in order to learn about this upcoming business opportunity and provide feedback to the Air Force. Additionally, this event will provide an opportunity for contractors to network with potential teaming partners and/or subcontractors.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the ESG to release the dRFP by the end of March 2013 which will be posted to FBO as a modification to this Special Notice.<br /><br />Details of the Pre-Proposal Conference are as follows:<br /><br />Date: Wednesday, 17 April 2013<br />Duration: 1 Day (approximately 8am-5pm EDT)<br />Location: <br />Kenney Hall<br />Air Force Institute of Technology<br />2950 Hobson Way<br />Bldg 642, Area B<br />Wright Patterson AFB<br />Dayton, OH</p>
<p>Please note that the date and location may be subject to change in the event of Sequestration or other unforeseen delays, and the Government cannot be held liable for any costs incurred by you or your company should there be any unforeseen changes to the event. Attendance at the Pre-Proposal Conference, while encouraged, is completely voluntary.<br /><br /><strong>Registration:<br /></strong>Attendees should register by clicking ONE of the links below.

<p>The acquisition is 100% set aside for Small Business.</p>
<p>North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this effort is 333924.</p>
<p>Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a single solicitation and a firm-fixed price contract will be awarded to one contractor as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about 29 Mar 2013 with a 60 day proposal period. An RFQ will be posted on www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by the agency. The solicitation and all subsequent notices and amendments will be posted on www.fbo.gov. The Government will not reimburse any interested parties for monies spent to provide a response to the subsequent solicitation notice.</p>
<p>A planned Site Visit will take place on 04 Apr 2013. A notice will be posted on www.fbo.gov with instructions about the Industry Day.</p>
<p>Any questions in regards to this notice must be submitted via email to the Contracting Office according to the contact information provided below. Please reference Solicitation Number FA8126-13-Q-0162 in your requests.</p>
<p>In order to do business with the government, it is mandatory per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, that all offerors must be registered with System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. Contact the POC on the website for information and guidance regarding these registrations.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (AFFARS)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Business &amp; Mission Support Division Chief, Directorate of Contracting, OC-ALC/PKC, Tinker AFB OK 73145, Phone: 405-736-3273.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT (SSA) AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT, INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ACQUIRE ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, NOR DOES THE GOVERNMENT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. <br>  <br> The purpose of this SSA is to identify potential sources capable of providing up to twelve (12) Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance Surveillance Systems (EMARSS) and Integrated Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS) for EMARSS within a forty-two (42) month of period of performance.  EMARSS is the Army's future force airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system.  EMARSS is a manned multi-INT Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) system that provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets in day/night, near-all-weather conditions with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS aircraft will be located within Aerial Exploitation Battalions (AEB), which are assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM). The EMARSS system will consist of a commercial derivative aircraft equipped with Electro-optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Full Motion Video (FMV) sensor, a COMINT collection system, an Aerial Precision Guidance (APG) system, line-of-site (LOS) tactical and beyond line-of-site (LOS/BLOS) communications suites, two operator workstations and a self-protection suite.  The technical requirements of EMARSS are available by contacting Michael Peduto, michael.p.peduto2.civ@mail.mil and Matthew Bushmire, matthew.bushmire.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> EMARSS will operate as a single platform in support of tactical missions.  Mission altitude and flight tracks are chosen to optimize sensor data collection on the target area of interest while avoiding known threats.  Flight tracks may be selected to strike a balance among the capabilities of multiple sensors, or to optimize collection from individual sensors based upon the daily collection tasking dictated by the tactical commanders Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs).  EMARSS will provide efficient response to Combat Forces ISR tasking with centralized Processing, Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) of ISR while simultaneously transmitting critical FMV and intelligence products to engaged tactical forces.  <br>  <br> Your response will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  <br> You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this SSA. Furthermore, this request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, Statement of Work/Performance Work Statements and/or Statement of Objectives.  Interested parties are responsible to adequately mark proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response accordingly.  <br>  <br> Any potential response shall address the following items: <br>  <br> 1) Identify how many EMARSS could be built within a forty-two (42) month period of performance.  Any response must be capable of building at least four (4) EMARSS aircraft that are able to successfully pass an operational test or developmental test within the first twenty-one (21) months.  The contractor shall be responsible for attaining an Army Airworthiness Release (AWR).  The response shall state whether the contractor is capable of developing the EMARSS aircraft on its own or would require a technical data package.  <br>  <br> 2) APG, Blue Force Tracking-Aviation, Distributed Command Ground System - Army software, Orion workstation control software, and Precision Strike Suite - Special Operation Forces software may all be assumed to be provided as Government Furnished Property/Software.  Identify any additional Government Furnished Property/Software that would be required to meet the Government's schedule.    <br>  <br> 3) Provide information as to how your company can provide EMARSS ICLS services for all technical issues for CONUS and OCONUS EMARSS systems.  <br>  <br> 4) Provide information regarding the ability to provide engineering and technical services for the EMARSS, including technology insertion, system upgrades and system integration.  Demonstrate the company's expertise in supply chain and logistics management. <br>  <br> 5)  Address in detail with supporting data company's recent relevant work performance and/or current work experience in the performing similar efforts with the same level of complexity and scale for the U.S. Government.  Company may provide work experience and past performance data related to affiliated companies and as such that work experience and past performance data will be identified as to the affiliated company submitting a response. <br>  <br> Responses to this SSA must be unclassified and shall be limited to thirty (30) pages to include all attachments and exhibits. Interested sources possessing the capability of meeting all of the requirements and conditions outlined above must so indicate by responding via email to Point of Contacts (POCs) identified herein.  All submissions must include full company names, POCs to include, name, position, office and mobile telephone numbers and email addresses.

System must provide the following salient characteristics:
1.Triage Categories
a.Needs to be able to triage patients.  The system will issues a number to the patient based on predetermined categories (Emergency Room, Pts with Appointments, Refill prescriptions, Etc)
b.System will display (on each licensed PC) to staff the number of patients waiting in each category for how long
c.Pharmacy staff then can selectively call the patient to the window, based on the urgency
2.Web Based Software ? each PC can access the program without it necessarily being installed on the PC.  Management will have be able to direct the workflow, example:  If there are a high number patients in the waiting room, pharmacist can be quickly taken off other tasks, just for a few moments to process the patients.  And if there is a low volume patients waiting yet a high volume of prescriptions to verify and dispense workload can be directed there.  
3.Reporting:  System need to have capability to generate a variety of reports
a.Average Waiting Time ? b.% of Patients seen in less than XX time ? ideal to show leadership how long it takes to acknowledge a patient that is in the waiting room c.Patients Per Day ? Pharmacy interacts with many patients in the booth for whom these are no prescriptions generated inside (questions, process for mail, etc).  This real workload that really is not measurable without a system like this.
4.Self serve for patients:  Kiosk that patient can receive a number from a central point in the lobby.

<DESC>DLA Land and Maritime prepared a solicitation for one time buys (see attached list of NSN's). Based on market research these items are not considered commercial items and will be solicited using FAR Part 15. For required quantity information, see attached list of NSN's to be shipped to (SW3121) Albany, GA 31704. FOB origin and inspection acceptance at origin is required. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 03/29/2013. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. The required delivery is 365 days. Best commercial packaging is acceptable. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars.
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.</p>
<p>See Notes:<br />(X) The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 03/29/2013.<br />(X) This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestricted technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C/ 2304 (c) (1). Approved source is: Lockheed Martin (03538).<br />(X)While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.<br />(X) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

______________________________________________________________

This Public Announcement is for the Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s (FAA) Information Technology Shared Services - Solution Delivery (ITSS-SD) procurement under ONE IT.  This notice is being posted in accordance with the FAAâ€™s Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.3.8: Pre-Release of Documents.   

Introduction:

The purpose of this follow-up notice to the previous Market Survey (posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website on November 23, 2012 (#12500)) is to provide multiple updates to firms interested in the procurement formerly referred to as ONE-IT, please note the following:

1. Provide an updated DRAFT Performance-Based Statement of Work (PB-SOW) that reflects significant changes to the scope of work and includes other critical information regarding the FAAâ€™s objectives and requirements for this procurement (see Attachment 3). Accordingly, the name of the procurement has changed from â€œONE-ITâ€ to â€œIT Shared Services Solution Delivery (ITSS-SD)â€. This distinguishes it from other ONE IT-related procurements. Note that the FAA will continue to refine its requirements and plans to post timely updates as deemed necessary. Highlights of the PB-SOW changes include:

a. removal of Capability Area A2 â€“ Infrastructure Operations and Support (Section 5.1.2 of prior version released November 23, 2012). These services will be procured separately. 

b. include draft language for potential performance standards, incentives and metrics (see Sections 6 through 8 of enclosed PB-SOW). 

c. clarify the purpose of Domain B services (see Sections 1.1-1.2, 2.1, and 3.2 of enclosed PB-SOW).

Please note that although these documents are in draft form they continue to provide substantial representation of the FAA requirements. 
 
2. Emphasize the FAAâ€™s cost optimization objectives for the ITSS-SD contract. The IT Shared Services Organization has established a goal to achieve Operational Excellence through a strategy of Optimized Service Delivery, with a specific objective to: â€œDrive down unit cost of service delivery for selected processes by 10% by FY2015.â€ (Reference: Office of the Chief Information Officer IT Shared Services Organization OneIT Strategy 2013-2015). 

3. Provide the List of Interested Parties based on permissions granted in Market Survey responses. The FAA encourages interested vendors to review this list for teaming considerations, as teaming will be allowed for the ITSS-SD contract. 

4. Provide notification of the following formal change in Contracting Officers: the designated Contracting Officer has been changed from Elisa Brown to Tye White. 

Nature of the Procurement: 

At this time the nature of the competition has not been finalized.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. 

The FAA is contemplating awarding multiple contracts for a period of performance of seven years (two year base period and five one-year option periods).  

The principle North American Industry Classification System NAIC codes for this effort are:

â€¢ 541151 â€“ Computer System Design Services 
â€¢ 541512 - Computer System Design Services

â€¢ 541519 â€“ Other Computer Related Services

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new program, The National Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Natural History Study (The National MDS Study). <strong><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).<br /><br />Background and Program Objectives<br /></strong><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking to better understand the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) through the initiation of an observational study of adults newly diagnosed with MDS, titled The National Myelodysplastic Syndromes Natural History Study (The National MDS Study).<br />An estimated 20,000 or more new cases of MDS are diagnosed in the United States each year. The incidence of MDS dramatically increases with age. MDS is a heterogeneous collection of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. While most cases occur in older adults, chemotherapy and other toxin-induced MDS and MDS due to inherited disorders occur in younger persons as well. Those suffering with this syndrome are predisposed to lethal infections, iron overload from repeated transfusions, and life-threatening bleeding. Some patients with MDS can develop chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia. Most therapies for MDS are suboptimal and not curative. <br />MDS is frequently asymptomatic, but clinically suspected in older patients with abnormal routine blood tests, recurrent infections, or excessive bleeding. Diagnosis requires evaluation of bone marrow for evidence of cells that are maturing abnormally and malignant cells. These findings, combined with peripheral cytopenia(s), abnormal bone marrow cytogenetics, and the degree of transfusion dependence, have been used to classify patients with MDS into risk groups and provide a general assessment of disease severity and possible prognosis. However, biomarkers that are clinically useful for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of a patient's response to therapy are not available.<br />The etiologies of MDS are not well defined. Distinct mutations and genetic modifications are thought to underlie the molecular basis of MDS, some of which may be independent predictors of poor survival. A comprehensive standardized longitudinal clinical dataset and a consistently-processed, well-annotated biospecimen collection will provide national resources that potentially can be used to: (1) identify genetic, epigenetic and biological factors associated with initiation and progression of MDS; (2) uncover fundamental information on the changes that occur in hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow stroma during normal aging; (3) reveal clinically useful biomarkers; (4) identify potential targets for new interventions; and (5) facilitate understanding of how patients with MDS are managed in practice. These resources will facilitate the conduct of basic and translational research on the evolution of MDS over time, and improve the diagnosis and clinical management of affected individuals. <br /><strong><br />Project Requirements<br /></strong><br />This requirement is for a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to provide overall coordination for The National MDS Study, which proposes to establish a cohort of 2,000 adults recently diagnosed with MDS, and up to 500 age-matched participants who are not diagnosed with MDS, but who are clinically suspected of having this syndrome. Most participants will be enrolled in The National MDS Study by clinical sites participating in either the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) or NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) Network. The DCC is expected to be experienced and highly competent in designing, coordinating, implementing, monitoring, and analyzing large (&gt;500 participants) multi-center clinical studies, and shall provide all necessary administrative, data management, and statistical support for The National MDS Study. Throughout the contract, the DCC will serve on the Protocol Writing Team, the Steering Committee, and the Executive Committee. The DCC will work collaboratively with these committees, the Central Laboratory and Biorepository, multiple organizations that participate in NCI-sponsored clinical trials, including the NCTN and the CCOPs, and NHLBI and NCI staff to accomplish the goals of the study. The DCC shall have demonstrated knowledge and leadership in biostatistics and epidemiological studies, and experience in developing, managing and implementing procedures and protocols for multi-center clinical studies that collect hematological biospecimens for future research. The DCC shall coordinate communications and logistics for The National MDS Study. The DCC shall be responsible for helping to develop and finalize The National MDS Study protocol. It is anticipated that molecular and genomic research studies involving selected patients with MDS will be conducted to enhance the value of the biospecimen and data resource, such as low-risk risk patients whose disease progresses while on study. The DCC will assist with the review and prioritization of these additional studies and will distribute funds for approved research studies.<br />The DCC shall be responsible for training clinical center staff in the study procedures, analyzing complex datasets, reporting data to an Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB), and preparing data for presentations and publication. The DCC will provide the facilities, informatics programs, validated operating procedures, and quality assurance programs necessary to coordinate The National MDS Study. This will include proficiency in multiple data systems; experience in customizing existing data systems; electronically acquiring and transferring data to and from multiple data systems in a secure and safe manner, including the data systems used by NCTN, a central laboratory or a biorepository; experience in linking and merging data sets from multiple sources; and experience in performing efficient informative searches of a biospecimen inventory for selecting samples for research studies. At the end of the contract, the DCC will transfer the biospecimen collection and all associated electronic documents and data files to a new facility at NHLBI's request.<br />The DCC is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:<br />1. Experienced and highly competent in designing, coordinating, implementing, monitoring, analyzing, and reporting large (&gt;500 participants) multi-center clinical studies that involve collecting biospecimens. Demonstrated experience in providing the necessary scientific experts, regulatory oversight, statistical and administrative support for these multi-center studies. <br />2. Key personnel with demonstrated knowledge and leadership in biostatistics, clinical research, and epidemiological studies; demonstrated ability and success in collaborating with multiple organizations to accomplish the same study; and demonstrated experience in research using biospecimens from clinical studies, as attested by his or her publication record.<br />3. Key personnel with demonstrated experience in developing, managing, and implementing procedures and protocols for multi-center clinical studies; experience with procedures to facilitate real-time central review of data or laboratory findings; and demonstrated leadership for a multi-center clinical study associated with a central laboratory. <br />4. Provide an expert in performing clinical research in MDS.<br />5. Provide expert advisors and consultants needed to support The National MDS Study, including a centralized review for histopathology.<br />6. Provide demonstrated abilities to analyze large, complex datasets; report data to an Observational Study Monitoring Board or Data Safety Monitoring Board; and prepare data for presentations and publication. <br />7. Demonstrated proficiency in multiple data systems. Experience in customizing existing data systems. Experience in electronically acquiring and transferring data to and from multiple data systems in a secure and safe manner, including the data systems used by NCTN, a central laboratory or a biorepository; experience in linking and merging data sets from multiple sources; and experience in performing efficient informative searches of a biospecimen inventory for selecting samples for research studies.<br />8. Demonstrated proficiency in developing and maintaining robust and secure private and public websites for multi-center clinical studies that meet Federal requirements.<br />9. Transfer interim, final, and redacted datasets together with all associated electronic documentation in a secure and safe manner in accordance with NIH and NHLBI policies. <br /><strong><br />Other Important Considerations<br /></strong><br />Under this solicitation, the Government anticipates award of one (1) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with cost-reimbursement task orders for a period of approximately seven to eight years with an estimated award date of July 1, 2014.<br />The Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.&nbsp; Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web page for the release of any amendments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a Central Laboratory and Biorepository (CL/B) for a new program, The National Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Natural History Study (The National MDS Study). <strong><br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).<br /><br />Background and Program Objectives<br /></strong><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking to better understand the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) through the initiation of an observational study of adults newly diagnosed with MDS, titled The National Myelodysplastic Syndromes Natural History Study (The National MDS Study).<br />An estimated 20,000 or more new cases of MDS are diagnosed in the United States each year. The incidence of MDS dramatically increases with age. MDS is a heterogeneous collection of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. While most cases occur in older adults, chemotherapy and other toxin-induced MDS and MDS due to inherited disorders occur in younger persons as well. Those suffering with this syndrome are predisposed to lethal infections, iron overload from repeated transfusions, and life-threatening bleeding. Some patients with MDS can develop chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia. Most therapies for MDS are suboptimal and not curative. <br />MDS is frequently asymptomatic, but clinically suspected in older patients with abnormal routine blood tests, recurrent infections, or excessive bleeding. Diagnosis requires evaluation of bone marrow for evidence of cells that are maturing abnormally and malignant cells. These findings, combined with peripheral cytopenia(s), abnormal bone marrow cytogenetics, and the degree of transfusion dependence, have been used to classify patients with MDS into risk groups and provide a general assessment of disease severity and possible prognosis. However, biomarkers that are clinically useful for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of a patient's response to therapy are not available.<br />The etiologies of MDS are not well defined. Distinct mutations and genetic modifications are thought to underlie the molecular basis of MDS, some of which may be independent predictors of poor survival. A comprehensive standardized longitudinal clinical dataset and a consistently-processed, well-annotated biospecimen collection will provide national resources that potentially can be used to: (1) identify genetic, epigenetic and biological factors associated with initiation and progression of MDS; (2) uncover fundamental information on the changes that occur in hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow stroma during normal aging; (3) reveal clinically useful biomarkers; (4) identify potential targets for new interventions; and (5) facilitate understanding of how patients with MDS are managed in practice. These resources will facilitate the conduct of basic and translational research on the evolution of MDS over time, and improve the diagnosis and clinical management of affected individuals. <br /><strong><br />Project Requirements<br /></strong><br />This requirement is for a Central Laboratory and Biorepository (CL/B). <br />During the contract period, this new program will establish a cohort of up to 2,000 adults recently diagnosed with MDS, and up to 500 age-matched participants who are not diagnosed with MDS, but who are clinically suspected of having this syndrome. The National MDS will create a comprehensive standardized longitudinal clinical dataset linked to a prospective collection of high-quality, well-characterized biospecimens to advance the understanding of disease progression. The National MDS Study protocol will define the clinical data and biospecimens to be collected, and research studies that will be performed on biospecimens to provide additional data (genetic, molecular, and biological) to enrich the value of the clinical data set and the biospecimen collection. The biospecimen collection, clinical data set, and datasets generated by the protocol-defined research studies will support current and future research in MDS, and be made available to the scientific community as national resources to encourage research to advance the understanding of the biology and genetics of these syndromes. <br />Overall coordination of The National MDS Study will be performed by a Data Coordinating Center (DCC; Solicitation No. NHLBI-ECB-HB-2014-05-AC). The CL/B will collaborate with the DCC and experts appointed by NHLBI to develop a protocol for The National MDS Study, conduct the study, and build a resource that will be comprised of well-annotated, quality biospecimens linked to comprehensive clinical, genetic, and molecular datasets. The CL/B will provide the scientific and technical expertise and the facilities to design, build, and store a quality biospecimen collection that will be linked to phenotypic, molecular and genotypic data. The biospecimens will be collected from participants enrolled at multiple clinical sites. The CL/B will also perform research assays defined in the study protocol and transfer the biospecimen collection to a new facility at the end of the contract. <br />During the contract period, biospecimens will be made available to the wider scientific community for approved scientific research protocols following procedures established by the NHLBI and The National MDS Study. At the end of the contract, the resource will be made available through the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repositories Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) program (www.biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov).<br />The CL/B is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:<br />1. Experienced and highly competent in managing a central laboratory, performing and interpreting research assays, and designing and building hematological biospecimen collections for multi-center clinical studies.<br />2. Key personnel with demonstrated knowledge and leadership, as attested by his/her publication record, in: designing hematological biospecimen collections for multi-center clinical studies; serving as a central laboratory for multi-center clinical studies storing hematological biospecimens (e.g., bone marrow, plasma, serum, whole blood); and performing research using fresh and frozen samples.<br />3. Key personnel with demonstrated knowledge in developing and implementing procedures to establish a central laboratory and build a biospecimen collection for multi-center clinical studies, and managing multi-center clinical study central laboratories and biospecimen collections. <br />4. Receive, process, inventory, aliquot, store, retrieve, distribute, and track hematological biospecimens, including histopathology slides, collected on multi-center clinical studies using validated procedures.<br />5. Perform research in MDS using fresh and frozen samples and interpret and apply the results, including performing and interpreting immunophenotyping assays, and isolating cell populations. <br />6. Provide a validated electronic biospecimen and laboratory management system and customize the system to enable study-specific functions to be performed. <br />7. Develop and distribute study-specific barcode label sets, collection kits, forms, and shipping materials to collection sites.<br />8. Develop, implement, and manage a program to train site personnel to perform study specific procedures and monitor collection site performance.<br />9. Transfer a biospecimen collection and all associated electronic documents and data files in a secure and safe manner to a new facility.
<p><strong>Other Important Considerations<br /></strong><br />Under this solicitation, the Government anticipates award of one (1) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with cost-reimbursement task orders for a period of approximately seven to eight years with an estimated award date of July 1, 2014.<br />The&nbsp;Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.&nbsp; The offeror is responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web page for the release of any amendments.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the notice is to correct the BAA release date to be 04/02/2013.<br /><br />Introduction
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) has been charged by the DHHS with developing products for treatment of radiation exposures resulting from a nuclear and radiological attacks to the stage where products are eligible for advanced product development by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or acquisition under the Project BioShield Act of 2004.</p>
<p><br />Description</p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to solicit proposals for contracts entitled "Development of Medical Countermeasures to Enhance Platelet Regeneration and Survival Following Radiation Exposure from a Radiological/Nuclear Incident" to advance the development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCMs) to enhance platelet regeneration and increase survival following radiation exposure. NIAID anticipates that research and development studies supported by this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will advance candidate MCMs toward eventual Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval or licensure to mitigate/treat radiation-induced thrombocytopenia and thereby improve survival. For this BAA, it is anticipated that candidate MCMs will enter the evaluation and development pathway at various stages, from early research to post marketing (for drugs or biologics that are already licensed or approved for other indications), so the offeror is expected to provide a Statement of Work based on the stage of the candidate and the work that needs to be performed to advance the MCM.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated on the underlying data supporting the amelioration of radiation-induced thrombocytopenia and improved survival, and the comprehensiveness, soundness, adequacy and suitability of the proposed scientific approach and methodology used to support the advancement of the candidate MCM for the mitigation or treatment of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) towards FDA approval or licensure under the FDA Animal Rule. The evaluation will also be based on the adequacy of the scientific and technical personnel, facilities, equipment, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) compliance and project management.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that 2-4 cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 3-year period of performance beginning on or about 06/02/2014.</p>
<p>The NIAID estimates that the annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) will be $1-2 million per contract award per year; however, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. The period of performance proposed by an offeror should not exceed 3 years.</p>
<p>For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals to be submitted in three methods: Paper, Disc (CD or DVD), and Online via the NIAID Electronic Contract Submission System (eCPS). The content of the paper, disc, and online proposals must be identical. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable.</p>
<p>For directions on using eCPS, go to the website https://ecps.niaid.nih.gov and then click on "How to Submit."</p>
<p>To submit online using eCPS, offerors must have a valid NIH electronic Research Administration (eRA) Commons account, which provides authentication and serves as a vehicle for secure transmission of documents and communication with the NIAID. The eRA Commons registration process may take up to 4 weeks. For more information, please see http://era.nih.gov/applicants/how-to_steps.cfm#register.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about 04/02/2013, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement; it is not a solicitation for bids or proposals. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking small business sources for a construction project, Dworshak National Fish Hatchery Bridge Replacement. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price. The period of performance is expected to be 150 calendar days after contractor's receipt of notice to proceed. Contract award is targeted for early October 2013.
<p>The scope of the work is to demolish the existing Dworshak National Fish Hatchery bridge and replace it with an at-grade crossing. The existing bridge is a timber structure with earth-filled abutments and asphalt paved approach ramps. Demolition will include dismantling the timber structure, removing the asphalt approach ramps, curbing, and lighting, removing vegetation including approximately 36 trees, excavating the earthen abutments, and clearing and grubbing the site in preparation for the at-grade crossing. Earthen material will be stored on Corps property near Dworshak Dam. The new at-grade railroad crossing will consist of pre-cast concrete planks. Other site work will include new lighting, signage, striping, fencing, gate, storm drainage piping and appurtenances, trees, irrigation, concrete curb and preparation and paving the new road surface.&nbsp; The span of the bridge is approximately 160 feet between the abutments.</p>
<p>Access for trucks that haul fish food across the existing bridge must be maintained throughout the contract performance period with the exception of one 18 consecutive calendar day closure. Demolition operations which require roadway closure will commence on or after 2 December 2013. The closure must be closely coordinated with hatchery staff to ensure minimum impact on the supply of fish food for the hatchery.</p>
<p>Contractor will be required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual.</p>
<p>NAICS Code 237310, Small Business Size Standard is no more than $33,500,000 in average annual receipts over the past 3 fiscal years. This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify small business concerns with the capability to accomplish the work. Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting a statement of their current or past technical experience (what the firm has done) and current or past performance (how well the firm did it) similar to or the same as the requirements stated above, will be used by the Government to determine whether or not to set aside this requirement for small business. Include a statement with your response indicating your bonding capacity and&nbsp;the size of your business (small business, 8(a) small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concern) and send it by email to Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task/delivery order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved as this is a follow-on order to a competitive initial order (FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) or 16.505(b)(2)(iii). <br>  <br> The US Army Contracting Command (ACC), National Capital Region (NCR), Alexandria, VA on behalf of the US Army Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304c(b)(3) as implemented in FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C)  intends to issue a follow-on task order sole source to Pragmatics, Inc. for Information Technology Support Services (ITSS) in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541513 with a size standard of $25.5 million. The period of performance is a base period of two months and two one month options. This sole source order will facilitate the completion of the evaluation of the large amount of information received in response to the full and open competitive solicitation set aside for small business and the best value selection resulting in a full term stand alone contract.

<DESC>The proposed effort consists of three tasks: creating a design methodology; generating a visualization tool based on an existing set of data; and extending the visualization tool to allow for new data.
The creation of a design methodology will be the basis for entire program.  Under this task, the current design optimization process will be transposed into a succinct methodology that can be visualized and analyzed.  The methodology will take into account that the user may have existing data or may be looking to start anew with yet to be completed computational data.
The methodology will then be codified and tested on existing data sets.  Where needed, additional computational simulations will be performed to enhance the design space.  The tool will then be extended to allow for entirely new data sets.  In this case, the tool will indicate what areas of the domain require more simulations and when the computational method needs to be enhanced to allow for more accurate solutions.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD <br> FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD <br> 1.Contracting Agency: Southern Regional Contracting Office, Brooke Army <br> Medical Center (BAMC), Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 <br>  <br> 2.Description of Action: Sole source acquisition with IQuum, for Influenza A/B <br> Assay. This action will be accomplished through the use of a Firm Fixed Price <br> Purchase Order. <br>  <br> 3.Description of Products/Services: The requirement is to purchase Influenza <br> reagent kits and consumables. The reagent kits are used to test various types of <br> biological samples for the presence of pathogenic and biological threat agents <br> using the Liat analyzer. <br>  <br> 4.Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), <br> Soliciting from a single source. For purchases not exceeding the simplified <br> acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the <br> contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem <br> only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing <br> agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization). <br>  <br> 5.Reason for Cited Authority: AMEDD Center and School has requested that we <br> enter into negotiations with IQuum directly. AMEDD C&S utilizes specific <br> analyzers in its mission as the multiservice JBAIDS/NGDS training center for the <br> Department of Defense and in its support of NGDS laboratory test & evaluation. <br> Only certain designated laboratory systems, including Iquum Liat, are part of the <br> NGDS training, test and evaluation. Only products that have been validated for <br> use on the Liat system can be used on this system; and only Iquum analyzer <br> hardware, software, test kits have been validated. Iquum is the sole manufacturer <br> of the Liat analyzer and related test kits. FDA Clearance of Liat kits for in vitro <br> diagnostics of human specimens has been granted only to specific Iquum products <br> to function on this specific Iquum analyzer. <br>  <br> 6.Contracting Officer Certification: I certify this justification is accurate and <br> complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br> Signature: ORIGINAL SIGNED 02/28/2013 <br> Name:Melissa Oliva

<DESC>Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity
<p>Advanced Technology Support Program III (ATSP3) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Delivery Order Contract</p>
<p>I. Contracting Activity: Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA)/ MEE Contracting Office, McClellan, CA.</p>
<p>II. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: <br />The US Air Force has a need to upgrade the AN/ARC-234 Airborne Integraged Terminal Group (AITG) communication system to comply with NSA Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) Policy 3-9 Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI). This task is a logical follow-on to the design and development effort being accomplished under H94003-04-D-0006-0187. This new delivery order will run concurrently with the initial order and will build hardware necessary for integration in the aircraft platforms.</p>
<p>III. Description of the Supplies/Services Required To Meet the Agency's Needs (including the estimated value):</p>
<p>The contractor shall build five (5) Baseband Input/Output (BBIO) Production Representative Engineering Development Models (PREDMs) and install one each into an AN/ARC-234 Airborne Integrated Terminal Group (AITG) radio set for integration and test by the RC-135 platform. The estimated value of this effort is $700K.</p>
<p>IV. Identification of the Exception to Fair Opportunity (Authority Cited):</p>
<p>FAR 16.505 requires the Contracting Officer to provide each awardee under a multiple award contract, a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,000 unless a statutory exception applies. The specific exception that precludes the fair opportunity process for this acquisition is:</p>
<p>FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<p>V. Supporting Rationale for Exception to Fair Opportunity:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Joint Chiefs of Staff have mandated the use of narrowband secure voice and established interoperability standards for the use of 5 kHz and 25 kHz DAMA non processed UHF transponders. All users were to be narrowband secure voice (NBSV) capable and demand assigned multiple access (DAMA) capable as of 1 October 1996. MCM 89 94, 28 July 1994, and CJCSI 6251.01C, 20 Nov 2007, require UHF SATCOM compliance with MIL STDs 188 181, 182, and 183.</p>
<p>The AITG is a single AITG Radio Set (AN/ARC 234) consisting of five line replaceable units (LRUs). The five LRUs are the Radio Receiver Transmitter (AIT), Remote Control Unit (RCU), Fill Panel, Low Noise Amplifier/Diplexer (LNAD), and Mounting Tray for the AIT.</p>
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) mandated a modernization of the AN/ARC-234 in CJCSN 6510. Requirements for the updated system are listed in NSA Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) Policy 3-9 Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (CMI). This effort will require modernization of both the hardware and software of the AITG communication system. Requirements of CM are to undertake the research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) effort to upgrade the AITG communication system.</p>
<p>In an effort to accelerate fielding of the AITG to meet mandated NSA need dates, the RC-135 program office requested the AITGs containing the PREDM BBIO to conduct platform integration and testing.</p>
<p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INITIAL ORDER AND THE FOLLOW-ON ORDER:</p>
<p>The initial order for development of the cryptographically modernized AN/ARC-234 radio is H94003-04-D-0006, Delivery Order 0187, awarded 27 Apr 2011 to Raytheon after all awardees were given full opportunity to be considered. The original delivery order is a $26.5M, 27 month effort to design, develop, build, and integrate modern cryptographic capability into the AN/ARC-234 radio. Its Period of Performance is due to end 31 Jul 2013. The follow-on order will build five (5) BBIO PREDMs to be installed on five (5) AN/ARC-234 radios for use by the RC-135 program for platform integration and testing. The five radios will be provided to Raytheon as Government Furnished Equipment approximated six months prior to installation of the BBIOs into the radios. The 5 PREDMs will be the same form, fit, and function as the prototype built by Raytheon for developmental testing. The new delivery order will run concurrently with the initial order.</p>
<p>RATIONALE FOR FOLLOW-ON EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY: Raytheon is the developer of the crypto-modernized Baseband Input/Output (BBIO) module to be installed in the AN/ARC-234 radio. Raytheon is also the sole developer, manufacturer and maintainer of the AN/ARC-234 radio. Raytheon owns the data rights to the radio. The crypto-modernized BBIO is still under development, and Raytheon maintains configuration control, and controls the design. The PREDM BBIO procured under this delivery must be identical to those developed under the original delivery order. Raytheon is the only vendor that can produce the BBIO and install them into the AN/ARC-234 radio.</p>
<p>The ARC-234 is a piece of highly-specialized equipment, requiring extensive National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 certification processes for both the device and the facility in which it is produced. A Type 1 product is a device or system that has been certified by the NSA for use in cryptographically securing classified US Government information. Type 1 is the highest level of NSA Information Assurance certification possible. It includes testing and formal analysis of cryptographic security, functional security, tamper resistance, emissions security, and security of the product development and manufacturing processes. Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the highly-specialized equipment. Another device cannot be substituted for the ARC-234 without a significant redesign and a lengthy certification process.<br />OTHER ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED: Competition under the existing ATSP3 ID/IQ contracts was considered. However, upon further analysis and discussions at the Acquisition Strategy Board, a follow-on contract to Raytheon is the only feasible alternative due to the nature of the program.</p>
<p>IMPACT IF THIS EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY IS NOT APPROVED:</p>
<p>If the Exception to Fair Opportunity is not approved, five BBIO PREDMs will not be built and installed in the AN/ARC-234 radios. Platform integration of the crypto-modernized AN/ARC-234 will be delayed until the availability of production units, extending the cryptographic vulnerability of the radio past its due date.</p>
<p>VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition</p>
<p>None. This is a one-time procurement of a Production-Representative Engineering Development Models for integration and testing purposes.</p>
<p>VII. Actions to Increase Competition:</p>
<p>This is a one-time procurement of Production Representative Engineering Development Models for the express purpose of supporting the platform integration and testing of the RC-135. There are no plans for further procurement of these development units.</p>
<p>VIII. Market Research:</p>
<p>There has been substantial market research conducted over the life-cycle of the AN/ARC-234 radio that contribute to this justification. The original AN/ARC-234 radio contract was awarded through competition in FY98 with the following program characteristics: limited or no data rights to design or software, no depot support equipment, post production engineering support and contractor logistics support. Since the initial award, there have been several sources sought synopses published to solicit interest in follow-on work with respect to the AN/ARC-234</p>
<p>Sustainment Support, SMC/LGKM, 10 Mar 2006<br />AN/ARC-234 Sustainment Support, SMC/PKL, 10 Feb 2012<br />ARC-234 Repair, ESC/HNK, 6 Jun 2012<br />Production of Radio Encrypter Modification on the ARC-234, ESC/HNK, 30 Aug 2012</p>
<p>Responses to the sources sought have been negative.</p>
<p>IX. Interested Sources:</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. Other Facts Supporting the Exception to Fair Opportunity:</p>
<p>None.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 18, Southern Arizona Veterans Affairs Health Center, Tucson, Arizona. 

Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The Government has a continuing need for the medical courier services currently being provided under contract VA258-13-F-0001. This contract was originally awarded on 1 January 2010 and ended on 30 September 2012 under GSA Schedule Contract GS-33F-0008T. On 27 September 2012 the contract was extended for six months through 31 March 2013. On 17 December 2012 this requirement was added to the Phoenix Courier Services requirement under solicitation VA258-13-R-0119 which was posted on Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) on January 14, 2013, with a closing date of February 14, 2013.  The RFP included language in Section E stating that offerors must be CVE certified in the vetbiz.gov database, and that offerors shall provide proof of certification with their proposal submissions.  One (1) Amendment was issued to answer potential offerors questions and correct the solicitation number that was located in the header portion of the solicitation.  A total of six (6) proposals were received by February 14, 2013. The Source Selection Team (SST) convened on 22 February 2013. Currently the technical evaluation boards for Phoenix and Prescott are still completing their technical evaluations. Due to the limited amount of time remaining to complete technical evaluations, award documentation, and the pre-award peer review process, the contracting activity requests authorization of this action to ensure continuity of services that directly impact patient care activities and to minimize any potential unrecoverable costs to the Government. The estimated dollar value of this action for a one month base period and three one month option periods is $64,428.32 or $16,107.08 per month. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The contractor shall provide regularly scheduled pickups and deliveries of a variety of items including but not limited to lab specimens, x-ray films, medical equipment, patient files, clerical supplies etc., between the Northern Arizona VA Health Care System (NAVAHCS) located in Prescott, Arizona, and the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC'S)located in Kingman, Bellemont, Cottonwood, Lake Havasu, and Anthem in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  Normally the deliveries would fit easily into a small van, utility vehicle or station wagon.  All items must be transported in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations. Due to the nature of this service and its direct link to patient care NAVAHCS requires that these deliveries be continued without interruption in service.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Transportation of patient medical specimens requires strict adherence to delivery time frames to ensure the integrity of the specimen. Transport by ground or air is also critical to the appropriate packing of specimens and the contractor is required to notify the lab of any change in type of transportation used that may differ from the original offer or change at any time. Commonwealth Carrier Corporation is registered in SAM as a Small Business. Commonwealth Carrier Corporation was award the current contract on 1 January 2010 and has been performing all elements of the requirement without any noted performance issues. As the incumbent under the current contract which will expire on 31 March 2013, Commonwealth Carrier Corporation is fully capable of continuing the service without any disruption. This limited interim contract would afford the Government an opportunity to ensure uninterrupted services are provided. The services provided under this contract are vital and necessary as lapses or interruption in services can directly affect patient care. Orienting another contractor on this requirement under such short notice would result in significant delays and interruption in service, resulting in possible veteran healthcare concerns. Accordingly, as the incumbent Commonwealth Carrier Corporation is the only firm capable on continuing to provide the services described in Section III above with the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling it requirements. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  As noted in paragraph 2 above this requirement was solicited as a total SDVOSB set-aside and a total of six (6) proposals were received from SDVOSB's. Currently the source selection team is evaluating these proposals and need more time to complete the evaluations in accordance with the solicitation terms and conditions as described in Section E of the solicitation.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  In accordance with FAR Part 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii), A comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases, the anticipated total cost of this action is $64,428.32 or $16,107.08 per month for a one month base period and three one month option periods. Due to the limited amount of time remaining to complete technical evaluations, award documentation, and the pre-award peer review process, the contracting activity requests authorization of this action to ensure continuity of services that directly impact patient care activities and to minimize any potential unrecoverable costs to the Government. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted for the purpose of determining price reasonableness since this is an interim contract action. The follow-on contract action will be issued to a set-aside small business.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  As stated herein, Commonwealth Carrier Corporation is the incumbent contractor and thereby is fully qualified to ensure continuation of services as provided and required under this action. This is a request to provide an interim contract to continue service pending the completion of the source selection process for the follow on contract for the current medical courier services requirement. The follow-on contract will be awarded to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business upon completion of the source selection process.
 
12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
