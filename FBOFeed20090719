<DESC>(Start Description)
The purpose of the USAID/Afghanistan Vertical Structures Indefinite Quantity Contract (VS-IQC) is to undertake selected facility assessment, renovation, refurbishment and construction activities. The task orders awarded under the VS-IQC will provide the USAID/Afghanistan Office of Infrastructure, Engineering and Energy (OIEE) with short and medium-term design and construction services relating to a variety of building facility types to support the objective of fostering sustainable infrastructure development in Afghanistan.

The VS-IQC will provide various services including design-build, construction, and construction management services required to erect vertical structures within Afghanistan. It is the intent of the VS-IQC to issue work by means of separate task orders. Task order statements of work will vary for each activity depending on the specific project requirements. Pricing and completion schedules, whether firm-fixed price or cost plus fixed fee, will be required under each task order. 

The specific nature of the work to be performed will be as contained within the individual task order statement of work. A full range of services may be required, from the initial stages of program development and planning, through all aspects of design that may be performed by either the Contractor or others, to the end result of completion of a construction project or service contract including the turnover of facilities constructed or completion of the required services.  The Contractor shall demonstrate a high degree of flexibility by providing design-build services, construction, and construction management services involving the fullest range of management, supervisory, administrative, planning, engineering, quality control, construction oversight, and project closeout activities associated with all aspects of the development of facilities infrastructure within Afghanistan in the present and foreseeable future. 

The estimated period of performance of multiple-award IQC contracts to be awarded from this competition will be five years from date of award. The cumulative estimated value of all the task orders to be issued under all "basic" IQC contracts shall not exceed $300,000,000.

The objective of this pre-solicitation notice is to alert potential offerors that USAID/Afghanistan’s Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) intends to issue a request for proposals so as to afford potential offerors the advanced opportunity to:

1)     Organize a proposal preparation team;
2)     Begin recruitment of personnel; and,
3)     Make teaming arrangements.
