The Contractor shall respond to these disabled vehicle calls within two (2) hours of the aforementioned notification.  A message left on the Contractor's Point of Contact (POC) answering machine constitutes a bona fide attempt to initiate a disabled vehicle call and the Contractor’s response time begins at that point.  The Contractor may provide a pager, cell phone number and/or an email address to facilitate communications with Government, this in no way relieves the Contractor of the stated requirement.  Hours for disabled vehicle recovery call coverage are 24 hours per day, seven day a week, including Federal Holidays for the full term for which this Contract is enforceable.  There is the potential for after-hours disabled vehicle call coverage with regard to this Contract.  This requirement shall be provided in accordance with the terms herein and at no additional cost to the Government.  If needed repairs to a vehicle rental for which a disabled vehicle call is made cannot be effected, that is, the vehicle returned to a good and safe operational condition, within six (6) hours of the initial notification, an equal type, or better, replacement vehicle rental shall be provided to the Government at no additional cost.  Vehicle rental recoveries under repair services shall not incur usage charges for the full days that they are out-of-service, that is, unavailable for intended use.  The Contractor shall afford to Government users and their authorized passengers utilizing vehicle rentals covered hereunder all due consideration and relief with respect to any retrieval and/or recovery action(s) of disabled vehicle rentals, to include, the disposition and accommodation of the user and any passengers should they be stranded due to a non-operational or unsafe vehicle as is customary of the commercial vehicle rental industry.  The Contractor shall provide a POC to serve as the Contractor's principle liaison for the purpose of satisfying this requirement, at a minimum, the POC shall assess, record, initiate and follow-up on disabled vehicle calls to ensure all the resolution efforts or actions are conducted in an effective and professional manner.        

13.  The Contractor shall invoice no more often than monthly, with the exception of any prorated costs of vehicle rentals for periods of less than one month.  These charges or costs, if any, shall be invoiced in strict accordance with FAR Clause 52.208-4.  A copy of the invoice shall be submitted to the Contracting Office.  Invoices shall be submitted with all appropriate supporting documentation stated herein.  Contractor's invoicing shall differentiate, that is, itemize the charges for each vehicle rental proved hereunder with regard to ACTUAL usage, (i.e., rental period).  Use of a unique serial number for each vehicle rental provided shall be used to facilitate this process.

14.  VEHICLE INSPECTIONS.  Two (2) technical inspections will be made of each vehicle rental ordered hereunder.  The initial inspection shall be made jointly by the Contractor and the  authorized Government representative at the time of delivery or pick-up for each vehicle rental.  Written document shall be generated, in duplicate, that itemizes any and all visible dents, dings, scratches or other damage and/or defects, as well as, providing an overall assessment of the operational condition of the rental vehicle.  This document/inspection checklist shall be signed by both inspecting parties and constitutes testament of the condition of vehicle rental at the time of delivery or pick-up by the Government.  The documentation used for this purpose shall be provided by the Contractor and shall be standard commercial type forms or reports.  The amount of fuel present shall be noted.  The mileage shown on the odometer shall be recorded for informational purposes only.

15.  A second technical inspection shall be conducted jointly by the Contractor and the Government representative at the time vehicle rentals are picked-up, recovered or dropped-off.  A written inventory or "inspection checklist" shall be generated for each vehicle rental to record and document the condition of the vehicle at the time it is returned to the Contractor.  Procedure shall follow that of the delivery inspection.  Copies of this documentation shall accompany invoices.  This document/inspection checklist shall be signed by both inspecting parties as testament of the condition of the rental vehicle at the time of return.  The document(s) used for this purpose may be the same document used for delivery, so long as, the functions of delivery or pick-up are distinct and easily discernable from that of return or drop-off of the effected vehicle rental.  The Government shall ensure an equal amount of fuel is present at return as was recorded at acceptance.  In the event the Government fails to do so, the Contractor agrees any charges to replace missing fuel shall be separate and apart from this contract, and is to be to coordinate directly with the Government representative to make arrangement for payment of these charges by Government Credit Card.
